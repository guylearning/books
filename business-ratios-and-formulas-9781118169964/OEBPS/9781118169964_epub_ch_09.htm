Accordingly, many of the measurements in this chapter focus on the efficiency of these types of activities. There are also measurements covering the payroll, general ledger, taxation, collections, and treasury functions.</p><p class="para">A key problem with all of the measurements noted in this chapter is that the accounting department is usually responsible for compiling the performance measurements of the entire companyâ€”which includes, in this case, itself. If the controller or CFO comes upon a measurement that shows poor accounting performance, there will be a temptation to delay release of the measurement or to alter its calculation to make the result look better. Consequently, the measurements noted here should be assigned to some other department, such as the internal auditing staff, to complete. Alternatively, the measures should be periodically reviewed by someone independent of the accounting department to ensure that they are being properly completed. Measurements to be examined in this chapter include:</p><table class="bodytable" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell">Purchase Discounts Taken to Total Discounts<br/>Percentage of Payment Discounts Missed<br/>Transactions Processed per Person<br/>Transaction Error Rate<br/>Average Time to Issue Invoices<br/>Average Employee Expense Report Turnaround Time<br/>Payroll Transaction Fees per Employee<br/>Time to Produce Financial Statements<br/>Percentage of Tax Filing Dates Missed<br/>Cash Collected per Aging Bucket<br/>Collection Effectiveness Index<br/>Best Possible DSO<br/>Partial Payment Agreement Percentage<br/>Percent of Cash Applied on Day of Receipt</td><td class="bodycell">Proportion of Products Costed Prior to Release<br/>Internal Audit Savings to Cost Percentage<br/>Internal Audit Efficiency<br/>Deduction Takeover<br/>Bad Debt Percentage<br/>Percent of Receivables over XX Days Old<br/>Allowance Exhaustion Rate<br/>Percentage Collected of Dollar Volume Assigned<br/>Auto Cash Hit Rate<br/>Unmatched Receipts Exposure<br/>Cost of Credit<br/>Earnings Rate on Invested Funds<br/>Brokerage Fee Percentage<br/>Borrowing Base Usage Percentage</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-001">PURCHASE DISCOUNTS TAKEN TO TOTAL DISCOUNTS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Few accounting activities can be shown to directly save money, but taking early payment discounts is one of them. From the accounting perspective, this means examining incoming invoices from suppliers to determine whether a discount is offered, determining if the discount is economical, and scheduling it for early payment. Comparing the proportion of purchase discounts taken to total discounts available can show how effective the accounts payable staff has been at saving money for the company. Any measurement result less than 100% should be considered unacceptable.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide total purchase discounts taken by the total amount of economical discounts available. The information needed for the numerator is generally simple to collect, because a typical accounting system will store the amount of the discount in a separate line item in the chart of accounts. The problem is in deriving the information needed for the denominator, since this information is not stored anywhere. One can query the supplier database in an automated accounting system to see which suppliers are listed as having discounts, but this will ignore any suppliers for whom the accounts payable staff has missed the presence of discounts on their invoices. Consequently, a better approach is to supplement the review of the existing accounts payable database with an ongoing audit sample of supplier invoices, to see what other invoiced discounts have been missed, as well as all offered discounts with terms so poor that they should be excluded from the denominator (since they are not viable discounts). The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09001.gif" alt=" " width="239" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The internal auditing staff of the Masterson Brick Company has been asked to calculate the accounting department's ability to take all purchase discounts offered by suppliers. The auditors compile the information about discounts shown in <a id="c9-tbl-001-1" href="#c9-tbl-001">Table 9.1</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c9-tbl-001" href="#c9-tbl-001-1">TABLE 9.1</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table09001.gif" alt=" " width="562" height="141"/><p class="para">The internal auditing staff finds that four of the five potential discounts were taken, but that one discount was taken that was not economically viable. Consequently, they choose to exclude the noneconomically viable discount from the numerator, since this figure should relate only to the total number of economically viable discounts available that are noted in the numerator. Their calculation is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09002.gif" alt=" " width="420" height="133"/></p><p class="para">Also, since the company's automated accounts payable system is set up for continuing early payments to Raster Builders (whose discount is not economically viable), the internal auditors inform the accounts payable supervisor and controller of this problem, so that the payment record for this supplier can be altered.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The results of this measurement can be misleading if invoices are sent outside of the accounting department for approvals, because a delayed approval can take longer than the required payment date on a discount. The same problem arises for centralized accounts payable departments that service many company locations, because invoices may be sent to outlying locations by suppliers, which builds in a time delay while these locations send the invoices to the central accounts payable location. If the approvals problem is evident, the accounts payable function can be restructured so that all invoices are logged in to the system for payment before they are sent back out for approvals, and then they can be paid on the required date without having to wait for an overdue approval. If delays are caused by a centralized accounts payable system, then the accounting staff can contact suppliers to have them change their bill-to addresses to match that of the accounts payable center.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-002">PERCENTAGE OF PAYMENT DISCOUNTS MISSED</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This is the same measurement shown in the last section, except that its focus is on the proportion of valid discounts <span class="italic">not</span> paid, rather than what is paid. It is most effective when presented alongside a detailed listing of specific discount-related payment problems, with the reasons why those discounts were missed.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of payment discounts missed by the total number of valid payment discounts available. An alternative is to divide the dollar volume of payments missed by the total dollar volume of payment discounts available, which focuses attention on the presence of large missed discounts. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09003.gif" alt=" " width="292" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Charleston Paving Company has missed taking several purchase discounts. To bring the issue to the attention of the controller, the assistant controller decides to calculate the percentage of payment discounts missed. Here is the relevant information:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total number of discounts available</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">142</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total number of discounts missed</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">6</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total dollars of discounts available</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$91,500</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total dollars of discounts missed</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$31,250</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">If the controller chooses to calculate the measurement based on the number of discounts missed, the result will be:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09004.gif" alt=" " width="380" height="37"/></p><p class="para">The measurement appears to show that the number of discounts missed is a small issue. However, the assistant controller sees that, contained within the small number of missed discounts, there is a very large dollar volume of lost discounts. The assistant controller consequently prepares the following alternative measurement, which clearly shows the dollar value of the problem:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09005.gif" alt=" " width="418" height="38"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The same cautions apply as were described for the last measurement (the purchase discounts taken to total discounts formula).</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-003">TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED PER PERSON</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> In the accounting department of a larger company, the bulk of the staff is occupied with the repetitive processing of various types of transactions, such as billings, cash receipts, and payments to suppliers. If there is little focus on improving the efficiency of these basic functions, then the company may find itself paying for the wages of far more accounting personnel than comparable departments in competing companies. The number of transactions processed per person can be applied to any repetitive transactions and tracked on a trend line to more easily see changes in efficiencies within these areas.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total number of transactions processed during the measurement period by the number of full-time equivalent employees required to complete the transactions. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09006.gif" alt=" " width="426" height="37"/></p><p class="para">An alternative is to use the number of line items within all transactions in the numerator, rather than the total number of transactions, on the grounds that some transactions contain far more line items than others. This variation is especially useful when measuring the performance of individual employees.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Jester Playing Card Company has a large billing staff to handle the thousands of invoices that it sends out to buyers of its high-quality playing cards. The controller wants to improve the efficiency of the billings operation and decides to track the number of billings transactions processed per person to determine the effectiveness of improving this operation. The controller elects to track this efficiency on a trend line, which is shown in <a id="c9-tbl-002-1" href="#c9-tbl-002">Table 9.2</a> for the last three months.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c9-tbl-002" href="#c9-tbl-002-1">TABLE 9.2</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table09002.gif" alt=" " width="558" height="125"/><p class="para">The controller has picked a good area for improvement, since the measurement shown at the bottom of the table reveals that the efficiency level is dropping in this area. A likely reason is that the department added a part-time person in February, whose efficiency level is probably less than that of the more experienced people who have worked there longer. The controller can likely improve the transaction efficiency measurement by concentrating on improving the other staff to the point at which the new part-time position can be eliminated.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Transaction processing rates per person are not very effective if a company is so small that it does not require accounting staff members who are solely dedicated to the completion of specific types of transactions, such as supplier payments. If a staffperson is required to complete several types of transactions during a measurement period, then it becomes difficult to clearly identify the time required to complete each type of transaction.</p><p class="para">An additional problem is that the measurement should not be used on a summary level to determine the average number of transactions processed by employees who work on several types of transactions during a single measurement period. Though this may at first appear to be a reasonable method for deriving some general level of staff efficiency, it assumes that the mix of transactions stays exactly the same from period to period. Actually, the proportions of different transaction types vary constantly, so that a greater volume of labor-intensive transactions will be required in one period, and a lower percentage in the next. This results in an efficiency measurement that reveals no relevant information.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-004">TRANSACTION ERROR RATE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The preceding measurement addressed efficiency, that is, how many transactions an employee or function can complete. However, it did not measure the number of transactional errors, which can climb dramatically if the focus is only on pushing through the largest possible volume of transactions. The cost of correcting an error is many times higher than the cost of doing it right the first time, so the transaction error rate should be used in concert with the number of transactions processed per person so as to ensure that efficiency improvements leading to increased volume are not also spewing out many additional errors. Also, the error rate can be used by itself as a valid measure of departmental performance, since error correction can tie up the services of a multitude of senior accounting staff, who can be better used for other activities.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Summarize the total number of transactional errors and divide them by the total number of transactions processed for the same period. Be careful to match transactional errors to the same period in which the transactions occurred; it is common for errors not to be spotted and corrected until a later period, so they are compared to total transaction volumes for the later period, which may be quite different from the volumes in the period when they occurred. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09007.gif" alt=" " width="254" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Chillo Ice Cream Company's accounting manager is focusing on eliminating several of the senior accounting clerks whose entire jobs consist of error correction. The relevant information is in <a id="c9-tbl-003-1" href="#c9-tbl-003">Table 9.3</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c9-tbl-003" href="#c9-tbl-003-1">TABLE 9.3</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table09003.gif" alt=" " width="558" height="102"/><p class="para">The accounting manager sees that the highest error rate is in the payables transactional area, with billings being a close second. However, because the time required to fix errors is twice as high for each billing transaction, the manager directs correction efforts to the billing transactions first, since this will have the largest payback in terms of time saved.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This is an excellent measurement. It should not be aggregated for all types of accounting errors, however, since some are easier to correct than others. For example, a large number of incorrect billings that are caused by an easily fixed change to the pricing file may make the proportion of billing errors look large, while a smaller number of errors related to cost allocations, which can be difficult to spot and correct, may actually represent a larger time commitment to correct. Consequently, the measure should be subdivided into each major type of transaction so that the impact of each error type can be more closely monitored.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-005">AVERAGE TIME TO ISSUE INVOICES</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The accounting department can have a considerable impact on the timing of cash receipts, based on its ability to issue invoices to customers as soon as possible after shipments or services have been completed. If this critical step is delayed, then the processing time needed by customers to approve invoices and set them up for payment will <span class="italic">not</span> change, meaning that the date on which payments are made back to the company will be delayed. This can put a company in a dangerously low cash flow position, or at least reduce the amount of interest income it can earn on its excess cash. For these reasons, the average time needed to issue invoices should be constantly monitored.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the shipment date from the invoice date for each invoice, and summarize the number of days required for all invoices issued during the period. Then divide the result by the total number of invoices issued. The number of days on weekends and holidays can be included or excluded, depending on a company's emphasis on issuing invoices even during these traditional days off. Also, the measurement can be modified to include only the 10 to 20% of the invoices with the longest delays following shipment, which focuses management attention on the worst problems in the invoicing process. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09008.gif" alt=" " width="290" height="35"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Asian Doll Company, importer of high-quality antique Japanese dolls, is having some difficulty getting its invoices out on time, resulting in delayed customer payments. The controller believes that the problem lies in the slow transfer of paperwork from the shipping department to the billing department. The controller decides to use the average time to issue invoices to highlight the severity of the problem. She takes a random sample of five shipments and their associated invoices, which are shown in <a id="c9-tbl-004-1" href="#c9-tbl-004">Table 9.4</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c9-tbl-004" href="#c9-tbl-004-1">TABLE 9.4</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table09004.gif" alt=" " width="556" height="127"/><p class="para">The total number of days required for invoicing is 27 (the total of the Days Delay column). After dividing this figure by the number of invoices sampled, this is the result:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09009.gif" alt=" " width="433" height="34"/></p><p class="para">The controller can go a step further and calculate the amount of cash that would otherwise be available for investment during those 5.4 days, which represents a lost amount of investment income.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As noted in the Formula section, the calculation can be thrown off if weekends or holidays are included, since their inclusion can result in a calculation that shows an inordinate length of time between shipment and invoicing. For example, if the shipping department sends out a delivery at the end of the day just before a three-day holiday, then the accounting department will not see the paperwork until the following Monday, at which point three days have already passed and will be counted in the measurement. Therefore, either discount these days from the calculation or assume that invoices will be issued on <span class="italic">all</span> days, irrespective of the presence of a holiday or weekend.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-006">AVERAGE EMPLOYEE EXPENSE REPORT TURNAROUND TIME</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> From the perspective of employees, there are only two accounting functions that matter: processing payroll and paying expense reports in a timely manner. The expense report turnaround time is critical to employees who have paid for company expenses on their own credit cards and need funds back in short order so that they can pay the credit card balances. An accounting manager can use the average employee expense report turnaround time as an effective means for ensuring that these reports are quickly paid.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the date when an expense report was received by the accounting department from the date when payment was distributed to the employee. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09010.gif" alt=" " width="395" height="14"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The manager of the local branch of the National Business Machines Company (NBM) is concerned that employees are not being paid for many weeks after they submit expense reports, resulting in credit card late fees and interest expense charges. To prove this point, the manager assembles the data in <a id="c9-tbl-005-1" href="#c9-tbl-005">Table 9.5</a>, which lists the expense report turnaround time for each employee.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c9-tbl-005" href="#c9-tbl-005-1">TABLE 9.5</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table09005.gif" alt=" " width="559" height="143"/><p class="para">The manager finds that the average delay in paying employees for their expense reports is 25.6 days, which is figured by summarizing the total interval in days from the table (128 days) and dividing by the number of sampled expense reports (five).</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> There are several ways in which this measurement can be altered. First, the accounting department may not receive an expense report until much later than the date listed on the report, because it has been diverted for approval by a supervisor. This makes it difficult to determine the exact date on which the accounting staff received the report for processing. One way to avoid this problem is to stamp the receiving date on the expense report. The expense report routing can also be altered so that it goes to the accounts payable staff first and then to the supervisor for approval; by requiring the accounting staff to pay the expense report after a predetermined minimum time, irrespective of the receipt of supervisory approval, employees will receive their payments on time.</p><p class="para">Another problem is that the date of payment to employees may not coincide with the date on which checks are printed, since there can be delays both in signing the checks and in distributing them. A company can use automated clearing house (ACH) transfers to avoid these delays.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-007">PAYROLL TRANSACTION FEES PER EMPLOYEE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A great many companies have found that it is well worth the effort of outsourcing their payroll processing functions to specialized service providers, thereby eliminating the hassle associated with payroll tax calculations and submissions. However, few companies go to the trouble of determining the annual cost of this processing on a per-person basis. They may be startled to find that the initial cost to which they agreed for the service has ballooned over time because of extra fees tacked onto the base processing rate for such services as direct deposit, sealing checks in envelopes, calculating special deductions, and tracking garnishments. For these companies, the payroll transaction fee per employee measurement is a valuable tool.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total payroll outsourcing fee by the total number of employees itemized on the payroll. Be sure to exclude from the total fee any charges that cannot be directly related to individual employees, such as special reports or payroll shipping charges. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09011.gif" alt=" " width="296" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> A new payroll manager has been hired at the Jebson Maintenance Company, which has a large staff of heating and ventilation maintenance technicians. The payroll function is the main accounting activity. The new manager is interested in obtaining the best cost-benefit performance from the payroll function, which is currently outsourced, and so compares the cost of the current outsourcing provider and the fees charged by a competitor (see <a id="c9-tbl-006-1" href="#c9-tbl-006">Table 9.6</a>), which are all based on the processing of a single biweekly payroll.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c9-tbl-006" href="#c9-tbl-006-1">TABLE 9.6</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell">Types of Fees</td><td class="headercell">Current Provider Fees</td><td class="headercell">Competitor Fees</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Minimum processing fee</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$50.00</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$15.00</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Processing fee/each</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1.00</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1.25</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Envelope stuffing fee/each</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$0.15</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$0.25</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Delivery fee</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$10.00</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Free</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Direct deposit fee/each</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$0.50</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$0.65</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">401(k) report</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$12.00</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$5.00</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sick time report</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$10.00</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$5.00</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Garnishment fee/person</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$2.50</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$3.50</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The company has 26 payrolls per year and 120 employees, all of whom take direct deposit payments. The company has requested 401(k) and sick time reports once a month. There are 10 employees whose wages are garnished. Based on these volume considerations, the total cost of the current provider is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09012.gif" alt=" " width="551" height="652"/></p><p class="para">This analysis shows that the competitor's bid is $1,156 higher than that of the existing service provider, primarily because the competitor charges higher per-employee fees (despite having lower fixed service costs). In this case, the variable payroll cost per employee is $42.90 if the current supplier is used, and $63.48 if the competitor is used.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As noted in the Formula section, segregate those charges that have nothing to do with the per-person fees associated with the payroll; in the example, these fees would be the minimum processing fee, delivery charge, and the two reports. By separating these costs, the pricing strategies of payroll suppliers can be determined, some of whom advertise low fixed fees to attract new customers, but who have so many extra per-employee fees that the total cost is higher.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-008">TIME TO PRODUCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A key performance benchmark for any accounting manager is issuing accurate financial statements in the shortest possible time period. Consequently, this measurement should be used on a trend line to measure the accounting department's ability to gradually reduce the required time over a period of months. It can also be subdivided into the time periods required by the controllers of corporate subsidiaries to submit completed period-end financial statements to the corporate headquarters.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the statement issue date from the first day of the month following the reporting month.

Logically, the controller elects to cut into this series of dependencies by focusing on cutting the inventory cutoff to one day and shifting some of the variance analysis into the last week of the preceding month, while also imposing a minimum variance cutoff size and thereby reducing the number of accounts being reviewed. These actions bring the series of dependencies down to a seven-day requirement, which matches the next longest activity (the bank reconciliation).</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> An accounting manager can use this measurement to show an ongoing improvement in the speed of financial statement completion, but at the cost of cutting back on accompanying reports and analyses, which are an integral part of the statements.

In many cases, the information required to complete a tax return may not even be available, so that the tax staff has no choice but to ask for an extension. However, there are also many cases where lesser returns, such as sales tax payments or franchise tax returns, must be filed by a specific date, or else penalties will be incurred. The percentage of tax filing dates missed as an ongoing trend-line measurement can indicate whether this is an ongoing problem. If the measurement shows that the percentage continues to increase over time, it is possible that the tax department is understaffed and so is falling increasingly behind in its ability to complete tax filings.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total number of tax returns filed after their due dates by the total number of tax returns filed. An alternative is to focus on the total dollar volume of tax penalties paid, which should include both penalties and interest charges. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09014.gif" alt=" " width="238" height="34"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Albatross Shoe Company is expanding its operations from the central United States to the eastern seaboard. As it does so, the accounting department finds itself burdened with additional tax filings to cover franchise taxes, sales taxes, and income taxes for 13 additional states. The controller wants to determine if an additional staffperson should be added to the department, which currently employs three people. Accordingly, the controller devises <a id="c9-tbl-008-1" href="#c9-tbl-008">Table 9.8</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c9-tbl-008" href="#c9-tbl-008-1">TABLE 9.8</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table09008.gif" alt=" " width="558" height="105"/><p class="para">The measurement reveals that the company's expansion into the additional 13 states has completely overwhelmed the tax staff, which needs more help immediately. Furthermore, the percentage of missed filings was actually increasing even before the addition of these extra states. Consequently, the controller calls in the tax department of a nearby auditing firm to assist with the short-term problem of completing the overdue tax filings and also engages a recruiter to find more tax personnel for the department.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> There are many types of tax returns, each having different types of penalties. For example, a missed franchise tax return may carry a penalty of only $25, while a missed income tax return may involve penalties in the thousands of dollars. Given the disparity in potential liabilities, it may be helpful to eliminate all small-penalty tax returns from the equation, focusing only on those that can result in large penalties.</p><p class="para">Another issue is that a tax form that is filed late, but for which an extension has been properly filed, will still appear in the numerator of the formula. If the purpose of the measurement is to determine the proportion of returns that will result in penalties, then those returns with extensions should be excluded. If the intent is to determine the proportion of returns that are late because of a labor shortage in the tax department, however, then they should be included.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0010">PROPORTION OF PRODUCTS COSTED PRIOR TO RELEASE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Though it seems obvious that a company should know what a product costs before selling it, it is common for the company to be in such a rush that this task is not completed. The result can be sales of a product that makes no money, or for which there is a cash drain whenever one is sold. Equally important is ensuring that product costing occurs well <span class="italic">before</span> the product release date, and on an ongoing basis during the design phase, to ensure that the design team is aware of the cost when it can still alter the design sufficiently to reduce excessive cost. The proportion of products costed prior to release is an easy measurement to make management aware of this issue.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of total products costed prior to release by the total number of products released during the measurement period. Of particular concern is establishing the exact date on which product costs must be completedâ€”it can be the date of product release or substantially sooner so that the design teams will have sufficient cost-related input to alter their designs as needed. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09015.gif" alt=" " width="276" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Hoosier Sneaker Company, maker of high-end high-topped basketball sneakers, releases new sneaker designs at a prodigious rate of one every 20 days. The cost accountant claims that there is no need to issue cost reports on each one, since they all use the same design platform. However, there has been a gradual and ongoing drop in company profits directly related to increases in the cost of goods sold. The controller asks the internal audit staff to review the situation. The lead auditor discovers that a key supplier has raised the price of its leather uppers on several occasions during the past year, which has contributed to a 10% drop in gross margins. During that period, the company produced 18 new sneaker designs, of which only the first three had costing reviews completed by the cost accountant. This represents a proportion of products costed prior to release of 17%. The controller promptly fires the cost accountant and decides to build this measurement into the performance appraisal of the next person hired into the position.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The cost accountant may protest if this measurement includes the release of all product variations, since this may result in a very large number of costing tasks. The task, however, is still necessary to ensure that there are no product variations that will result in inadequate margins. The only time the measurement should not be used is when the incremental value of any minor product change is clearly so tiny that there will be no significant variation in the existing product cost.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0011">INTERNAL AUDIT SAVINGS TO COST PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The internal audit staff provides a number of crucial functions, such as preventing or detecting fraud, passing judgment on the controls used for new accounting systems, and recommending changes that will result in lower costs. Of these activities, only the last one is easily measurable. Compare the sum total of all recommended cost savings by an internal audit group to its operating cost to arrive at a proportion of savings to costs. This measurement is subject to the concerns noted later in the Cautions section.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total amount of savings recommended by the internal audit staff by the total internal audit expense, which should include all departmental costs, such as salaries, payroll taxes, travel and entertainment, and support costs.

The measurement is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09016.gif" alt=" " width="242" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The audit committee of the Amalgamated Munitions Factory is concerned about the total cost of the internal audit department. Its staff of four costs $285,000 per year, while its travel and support costs are $104,000 per year. The CFO explains that the department does not just search for fraud and review internal controls. On the contrary, it recommended the following three changes in the past year:</p><div class="list"><p class="listnumbered"><span class="bold">1.</span> Eliminate half of the accounts payable staff by installing a preexisting automated three-way matching system for payable transactions, saving $185,000.</p><p class="listnumbered"><span class="bold">2.</span> Outsource the telephone support function, eliminating one in-house position, saving $29,000.</p><p class="listnumbered"><span class="bold">3.</span> Improve the accuracy of bills of material, thereby cutting excessive purchasing costs and eliminating excess parts from the warehouse, saving $52,000.</p></div><p class="para">All of the suggestions were implemented.

For this reason, the measurement should not be used as a key performance indicator for the department, but rather as a lesser measure to which performance bonuses or evaluations are <span class="italic">not</span> tied.</p><p class="para">Also, the recommended savings listed in the numerator can be wildly inflated or impractical, since they are strictly recommendations, and may never be tested for their validity. This problem can be reduced by the use of a review board that accepts or rejects recommended savings.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0012">INTERNAL AUDIT EFFICIENCY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The internal audit department's efficiency can be difficult to measure, since a significant finding, such as a fraud situation, may require much more staff time than was originally planned. Nonetheless, like other service functions, proper planning of audit requirements should result in a steady flow of completed audits on a continual timeline that can be measured. If additional work is required, such as may be caused by a fraud investigation, it can then be scheduled as a new project and included in an orderly manner into the work schedule of the department. With proper planning, then, it is possible to use the internal audit efficiency measurement to gain a general understanding of the operating efficiency of the department.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of internal audits completed by the total number of internal audits planned. If there are partially completed audits at the beginning and end of the measurement period, then these can be included in the measurement by using the percentage of completion method (see Example).

Its manager wants to determine the efficiency of the group in completing its assigned audits. He scheduled 109 audits at the beginning of the year. Also, five audits at the beginning of the year had 120 scheduled hours of work finished out of an initial budget of 720 hours. At the end of the year, three jobs were still open; they had accumulated 142 hours of work out of 310 scheduled hours. The manager calculates the internal audit efficiency measurement as follows:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09019.gif" alt=" " width="466" height="70"/></p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09020.gif" alt=" " width="527" height="213"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measurement focuses solely on the ability of the internal audit staff to complete their audits, not on their ability to discern any systemic problems arising out of those audits. Consequently, the measurement must be supplemented by a qualitative review of the results of all completed audits.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0013">DEDUCTION TURNOVER</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> When customers take deductions from the payments they owe, the accounting staff receiving these deductions must spend a considerable amount of time researching and resolving them. Given the time involved, it makes sense to calculate how frequently the volume of deductions is turning over. Rapid turnover means that the accounting staff is rapidly resolving deduction issues, while slow turnover implies that there is not enough staff available to conduct the necessary amount of research. Thus, slow deduction turnover may trigger the hiring of additional accounting personnel.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Add together the number of unresolved deductions at the beginning of the year and the total number of new deductions received during the year, and divide by the number of deductions outstanding at the end of the year. It may be useful to track this metric on a trend line. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09021.gif" alt=" " width="552" height="38"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Marvin Motors handles repair work for many auto dealerships in a four-state area, but must also deal with a number of deductions from its invoices that the dealerships take, claiming flaws with the repair work that Marvin completes. The controller of Marvin believes that her accounting staff is getting behind on researching deductions, and calculates deduction turnover for the past three years to determine whether this is the case. Her results are:</p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/tableu09001.gif" alt=" " width="559" height="102"/></p><p class="para">The trend line of the metric clearly shows that deduction turnover has continued to slow down for the past two years, which appears to be driven by a continual increase in the number of deductions received. The controller should consider assigning additional staff to deduction resolution.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This metric only deals with the grand total amount of deductions; it does not address the difficulty of the underlying deductions, some of which may take considerably longer than usual to properly address. Also, the accounting staff could write off large numbers of deductions to improve the deduction turnover metric, even though spending more time on them might result in a more favorable resolution.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0014">BAD DEBT PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A company should keep track not only of the total amount of bad debts incurred each year, but also their trend line, the specific reasons why each one became a bad debt, the relationship between corporate credit policy and the amount of bad debts incurred, and the company's bad debt experience in relation to the rest of the industry. All of these comparisons are needed to best determine how bad debt levels are being controlled. The most basic of these measurements is the bad debt percentage, which compares the amount of bad debt incurred to either the total amount of credit sales or total outstanding accounts receivable.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide total bad debt dollars by the total amount of accounts receivable. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09022.gif" alt=" " width="250" height="37"/></p><p class="para">The problem with using accounts receivable as the denominator for this calculation is that it only shows the relationship of bad debts to a small proportion of sales, which are represented by the accounts receivable balance. An alternative approach is to divide total bad debt dollars by total annualized credit sales; if this approach is used, however, then the numerator will be comparable to the denominator only if the bad debt figure is annualized, either by using the last 12 months of bad debts on a rolling basis, or by annualizing the amount of bad debts incurred over a shorter period. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09023.gif" alt=" " width="216" height="34"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The auditors of the Night Vision Company, maker of night vision baby monitors, want assurance that the company has reserved a sufficiently large bad debt reserve to cover its year-end accounts receivable. The company has provided them with the quarterly information in <a id="c9-tbl-009-1" href="#c9-tbl-009">Table 9.9</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c9-tbl-009" href="#c9-tbl-009-1">TABLE 9.9</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table09009.gif" alt=" " width="556" height="124"/><p class="para">Initially, the company's reserve of 8% of sales appears reasonable, since the bad debt percentage has been exactly 8% for the entire year. However, the accounts receivable turnover rate has been dropping throughout the year. This is a prime indicator to the auditors that some bad debts are not being recognized by the company, but instead are being held in accounts receivable. If the accounts receivable turnover at year-end were 10 turns, as they were during the first quarter of the year, then the accounts receivable balance should be only $150,500 ($1,505,000 annualized credit sales divided by 10 turns), as opposed to the $215,000 listed on the books. It is possible that the difference of $64,500 is unrecognized bad debts, which would increase the bad debt percentage to more than 12%. The auditor's next action should be a detailed review of all overdue accounts receivable, to see if specific bad debts are not being recognized.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measurement can be easily altered by anyone who does not want to have a high bad debt percentage. The key problem is that the numerator is composed of the total bad debt dollars recognized. If the controller does not want to recognize a bad debt, the amount is simply left in accounts receivable. Another problem is that previously recognized bad debts that are later paid by customers must be backed out of the bad debt expense, rather than being reinvoiced as new sales. In the first case, the bad debt percentage will be too low; in the latter case, it will be too high.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0015">PERCENT OF RECEIVABLES OVER XX DAYS OLD</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A company can precisely tailor its accounts receivable measurements by calculating only that portion of receivables that are older than a specific date. This is particularly useful in industries in which it is customary to pay late, so a conventional days of receivables measurement will not tell an accounting manager if there is actually a problem with collections. For example, if the traditional payment period is 65 days, then it is difficult to tell from a days of receivables measurement of 60 days if all invoices are not quite due for payment, or if some proportion of them are well past the customary payment date. The percent of receivables over XX days old is a good way to define this problem.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total dollar amount of all outstanding receivables exceeding a user-specified age by the total amount of all accounts receivable outstanding. The measurement is more accurate if all bad debts for which a credit has already been created can be netted against their corresponding credits, thereby eliminating them from the numerator. Otherwise, an old bad debt may still appear in the numerator without an offsetting credit. The credit is usually much newer than the debt and so will be excluded from the date range used to select transactions for the numerator. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09024.gif" alt=" " width="364" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Kensington Ski Company, maker of low-end parabolic skis for beginners, collects on its accounts receivables after an average of 80 days. The delay is caused by the cash shortage of skiing retailers, who must liquidate their ski stocks before Christmas before they can pay their suppliers. The company has average days of receivables of 85 days, which does not tell the collections manager if all invoices are just a few days overdue, or if there is a more substantial problem with very overdue accounts. The collections manager decides that any invoice more than 95 days old is a potential bad debt and calculates the percentage of receivables over 95 days old, comparing the measurement to the results for the same period in the preceding year. The comparison is shown in <a id="c9-tbl-0010-1" href="#c9-tbl-0010">Table 9.10</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c9-tbl-0010" href="#c9-tbl-0010-1">TABLE 9.10</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell"></td><td class="headercell">Current Year</td><td class="headercell">Previous Year</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Receivables over 95 days</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$142,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$121,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total receivables</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$4,050,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$2,881,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Percent of receivables over 95 days old</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">3.5%</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">4.2%</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The comparison shows that the company is having a better collections experience than in the previous year. However, the $142,000 of overdue accounts is still substantial, so the collections manager gets to work identifying the specific problem accounts and contacting them about payment.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> A self-serving collections manager can alter the number of days used in the formula so that the amount overdue always looks insignificant. For example, if a large unpaid invoice is 69 days old, the measurement can be set at anything over 69 days in order to exclude it, thereby making the collections department's performance look better than it really is. This problem can be avoided by consistently using the same number of days in the measurement for many periods, thereby also giving a better period-to-period comparison of results.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0016">ALLOWANCE EXHAUSTION RATE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Is the amount in the allowance for doubtful accounts sufficient? This is a common question that is debated between the controller and the outside auditors every year, with the controller taking the optimistic view and the auditors a more pessimistic view. One way to examine this issue is through the allowance exhaustion rate, which is the period of time it would take the allowance to be exhausted as of any point in time, given the amount of subsequent receivable write-offs. This information is useful on a historical trend line, since the allowance exhaustion rate from previous periods can be applied to the current allowance for doubtful accounts to determine whether it is adequate.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract all subsequent receivable write-offs from the allowance for doubtful accounts until it has been exhausted, and measure the time required to reach that point. Do not add to the calculation any subsequent additions to the allowance.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Corn Brothers Distributors establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts of $300,000 as of the end of its fiscal year that is based on an ending accounts receivable balance of $8,575,000. The auditors are not sure if this is a sufficient amount, and calculate the allowance exhaustion rates for the allowance at the end of the last three years for comparison purposes:</p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/tableu09002.gif" alt=" " width="559" height="102"/></p><p class="para">The evidence suggests that the allowance of $300,000 will be exhausted sooner than was the case in previous years. The allowance exhaustion rate has been fairly consistent in the past, averaging 4.8 months. On a proportional basis, the proposed allowance will probably be exhausted in 4.2 months. Thus, given the more rapid allowance exhaustion rate and the reduced percentage of receivables represented by the allowance, the auditors have a strong case for reserving a larger allowance.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measurement is based on the assumption that roughly the same proportion of receivable write-offs that occurred in the past will continue to hold true in the future. This could be a spurious assumption, since a company may tighten or loosen its credit policy, or general economic conditions might alter the ability of customers to pay. Consequently, any historical measurements derived from it should not be applied too rigorously to the current amount in the allowance for doubtful accounts.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0017">PERCENTAGE COLLECTED OF DOLLAR VOLUME ASSIGNED</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The collections function is difficult to manage, since it is highly dependent on the hiring and support of a skilled group of collections personnel. This requires constant monitoring of collection results and replacement of those who are not performing above a minimum level. To do so, a good measure is the percentage of overdue invoices collected out of all those that have been assigned to each member of the collections staff. The measure can be used to monitor the performance of either an internal collections staff or a collections agency to which accounts have been assigned.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> If a collections agency is being monitored, divide the cash received back from the agency by the total amount of accounts receivable assigned to the agency. Since the numerator will include the collection agency's fee (which is subtracted from any funds collected), however, it will tend to show an unusually low percentage; one may consider removing the fee deduction when running the calculation so as to get a better idea of the collection agency's performance. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09025.gif" alt=" " width="354" height="37"/></p><p class="para">If the entity being measured is the internal collections staff, the same measurement is used. It is more common, however, to calculate the measure for individual employees within the department so that the most precise determination can be made of performance levels by person.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Meek Furniture Company has hired the Irascible Collection Agency to collect all of its accounts receivable that are more than 90 days old. The Irascible's standard fee is one-third of all moneys collected. In the past year, Meek passed $83,500 in 90-plus day receivables to Irascible, which returned $28,500 to Meek as a result of its activities. Company management is more interested in Irascible's collecting effectiveness than the amount of cash it collects, so it chooses to measure Irascible's collection performance with its one-third collection fee removed from the calculation. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09026.gif" alt=" " width="454" height="132"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measurement can yield misleading results if the accounts receivable assigned to a collection agency or in-house collections staff are not compared to cash receipts related to those same receivables. For example, if a collection agency were given $100,000 to collect, followed by another $100,000 two months later, the cash received from its efforts should only be linked to the first $100,000 until a sufficient amount of time had passed for it to have made reasonable collection efforts on the second $100,000. If this problem is not addressed, a common result will be an excessively low percentage collected, because cash receipts are being compared to additional new receivables as well as the original base of receivables from which they were collected.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0018">CASH COLLECTED PER AGING BUCKET</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> When overdue accounts receivable are assigned to a collections person, the collector is typically judged based on the percentage of those receivables collected. The collections person knows that the most recent receivables are usually the ones most easily collected, however, and so will spend a disproportionate amount of time working on them. This means that older receivables are less likely to be resolved, and so will be more likely to eventually be written off. To detect if this problem exists, measure the amount of cash collected per aging bucket. This is an unusual metric, because it is in the form of a report, rather than a ratio.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Create a grid report with a separate column for each aging bucket and a separate row for each collector. Within each cell in the grid, list the cash collected, the amount outstanding, and the percentage collected. The report format is shown in the following example.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Quixotic Corporation has four collections people in its accounting department, and the collections manager wants to track their collections performance during the past month.

Use instead the collection effectiveness index (CEI), which more precisely determines the effectiveness of the credit and collections staff. This measure compares what was collected in a given period to what was available to collect. A score close to 100% indicates a high degree of collection effectiveness.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Add together the beginning receivables for the measurement period, plus credit sales during the period, and subtract ending total receivables.

For example, to measure the CEI for a quarter, divide the credit sales for the quarter by three before using it in the formula.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0020">BEST POSSIBLE DSO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> It is useful to ascertain the ideal number of days outstanding for accounts receivable, since management can use this figure as a benchmark against which it compares the actual number of days sales outstanding (DSO) in its accounts receivable. If the numbers are relatively close, then the company is doing a good job of collecting its accounts receivable in a timely manner. The ideal number of days outstanding is called the best possible DSO.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> To calculate best possible DSO, multiply the ending amount of current accounts receivable by the number of days in the measurement period, and then divide by the amount of credit sales in the measurement period. Thus, if you were measuring best possible DSO for an entire year, the formula would be:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09029.gif" alt=" " width="260" height="35"/></p><p class="para">Or, if you were measuring best possible DSO for a month, the formula would be:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09030.gif" alt=" " width="250" height="38"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Toller Trolleys sells accessories for trolley cars. Its controller wants to measure the effectiveness of the collections staff, and decides to compare Toller's best possible DSO to its actual DSO. At the end of the most recent month, Toller had $880,000 of current accounts receivable. During the past year, it had credit sales of $12,000,000. This results in best possible DSO of:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09031.gif" alt=" " width="344" height="67"/></p><p class="para">This figure compares poorly to the company's actual DSO, which is at 58 days. Clearly, the collections staff has a great deal of room for improvement!</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Be sure to only use the <span class="italic">current</span> accounts receivable in the numerator of this metric, since adding older receivables would artificially increase the number of DSO days. Also, the measurement can be skewed if a company were to issue a large dollar value of invoices within or outside the measurement period.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0021">PARTIAL PAYMENT AGREEMENT PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> It can be difficult to quantify the ability of a collections person to collect cash on overdue accounts receivable. One possibility for doing so is the partial payment agreement percentage. This involves tracking the amount of recurring promises to pay that the collections staff has extracted from those customers having overdue accounts receivable. As payments are gradually received against these promises to pay, the collections staff must refresh the outstanding amount of promises to pay by entering into similar agreements regarding other overdue receivables.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Summarize the total remaining amount of recurring promises to pay, subtract any postdated checks already in the possession of the collections department, and divide by the amount of overdue accounts receivable assigned to the collections staff. The amount of postdated checks already in hand is subtracted from the numerator, since this is presumed to be nearly cash, and therefore no longer an account receivable. The calculation is usually made for each individual collections person, since it is intended to be used to evaluate performance. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09032.gif" alt=" " width="448" height="34"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The credit manager of the Payday Loans Company has assigned $500,000 of overdue customer loan payments to Emile DuPont, a collections person. Emile contacts the customers and has several of them sign agreements to pay the amounts outstanding over various intervals. The total of these agreements is $180,000. Several also send him postdated checks totaling $50,000, which are part of the agreements. The calculation of his partial payment agreement percentage is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09033.gif" alt=" " width="352" height="74"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Though this percentage provides a reasonable means for quantifying the performance of a collections person, it does not measure the probability that payments will actually be received, and also does not measure the time period over which cash collections will be made. Furthermore, there is an incentive for collections people to not record postdated checks in the tracking system because it is used to reduce their partial payment agreement percentage.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0022">PERCENT OF CASH APPLIED ON DAY OF RECEIPT</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> There is nothing more irritating for a collections person than to contact a customer about an overdue payment, only to find that the customer had already paid, and the company had already received the money without updating its accounts receivable records. This is caused by inefficiency within the collections staff. This problem can be tracked by measuring the percentage of cash receipts applied to the accounts receivable records on the day of cash receipt.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Summarize the dollars of cash applied on the day of cash receipt (which should be available in the cash receipts journal) by the total dollars of income on the day of receipt (which comes from the bank deposit slip for that day). If there are also wire transfers directly to the company's bank account, then these can be discovered by completing an on-line bank reconciliation on a daily basis; this information should then be included in the measurement. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09034.gif" alt=" " width="306" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Today's cash receipts at the Holiday Health Spa include $1,200 in cash, $6,025 in checks, a $500 wire transfer, and a $3,250 automated clearing house (ACH) receipt. There is no indication of who sent the wire transfer, so the accountant entered this amount into a cash holding account, pending resolution. A total of $10,325 was applied to specific accounts receivable on the day of receipt. Based on this information, the measurement can have two results. First, include the wire transfer in the calculation, on the grounds that it is the accountant's responsibility to research the cash receipt and appropriately record it. This yields the following result:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09035.gif" alt=" " width="552" height="68"/></p><p class="para">If the wire transfer is excluded from the calculation on the grounds that the accountant has no way of knowing how it should be applied, then the calculation changes to the following format:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09036.gif" alt=" " width="489" height="68"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As just noted in the Example section, it may not be possible to apply cash to the receivable records, because customers have not indicated which invoices are to be paid with the cash. The amount of these funds must then be recorded in a holding account until the customers can be contacted about the problem. On the grounds that a missing cash application is the customer's fault, one can exclude the amount of this unapplied cash from the measurement. One can also include this cash in the measurement, however, on the grounds that this will force the cash applications staff to rapidly resolve the problem with customers so as to achieve the highest possible measurement result.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0023">AUTO CASH HIT RATE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A company may install an automated system for examining incoming payments from customers and applying them to open accounts receivable. This is an excellent labor-saving device, but an improperly installed system may not be as effective as it should be. The auto cash hit rate is designed to measure the effectiveness of this system, which may lead management to spend additional time fine-tuning the system to improve the percentage of cash payments being applied automatically.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of customer payments completely applied automatically by the total number of customer payments received. Do not include in the numerator any cash receipts that required even the smallest amount of manual intervention. Also, do not calculate this formula based on the dollar amounts applied, since that does not necessarily represent the volume of payments received. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09037.gif" alt=" " width="352" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Emberly Electric sells a wide array of electrician supplies, for which it invoices several hundred customers. There are a large number of check payments associated with these invoices, so Emberly installed an automatic cash application system to handle them. In the most recent month, it found that 3,700 invoice line items were automatically applied, out of a total of 5,100. This is an auto cash hit rate of 73%. When compared to the 75% figure from the preceding month, it appears that the new system is not making headway in applying any additional cash payments, so management calls in an auto cash consultant to assist with improving the hit rate.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The intent of this metric is to spot areas in which the auto cash hit rate can be improved, so it is best to accompany it with an examination of the problems that prevented additional cash payments from being applied properly. A relatively high percentage may not be too difficult to attain, but the remaining unapplied customer payments may contain a number of problems that require considerable attention to overcome.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0024">UNMATCHED RECEIPTS EXPOSURE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> When the accounting staff receives a cash payment for which there is no clearly obvious offsetting account receivable, a common result is that the cash is recorded in a suspense account. When the accounting staff has time, it investigates each item in this account and gradually clears it out. However, what if the accounting staff never reconciles the account? A common result is increasingly incorrect accounts receivable, with collection calls being made to customers who have already paid the company. A simple ratio designed to give the controller a feel for the relative size of the unmatched receipts suspense account is the unmatched receipts exposure ratio.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total amount in the unmatched receipts suspense account by the total accounts receivable balance. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09038.gif" alt=" " width="353" height="34"/></p><p class="para">Since cash receipts are most likely to be associated with accounts receivable that are just coming due for payment or are past due, it makes sense to modify this formula so that the unmatched receipts are only compared to noncurrent accounts receivable. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09039.gif" alt=" " width="353" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Salmon Reel Company sells fishing equipment to thousands of accounts, and frequently receives unidentified payments or payments containing poorly documented discounts. Given the high daily volume of cash receipts, it usually parks these receipts in a suspense account and then assigns senior accounting staff to an ongoing reconciliation when they have time available. Following a recent surge in sales, the collections staff reports that customers claim payments have been made, but the payments are not reflected in the accounts receivable aging report. To determine whether more staff time should be allocated to suspense account reconciliation, the controller calculates the unmatched receipts exposure for the past month and one year ago, as shown in <a id="c9-tbl-0011-1" href="#c9-tbl-0011">Table 9.11</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c9-tbl-0011" href="#c9-tbl-0011-1">TABLE 9.11</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table09011.gif" alt=" " width="555" height="83"/><p class="para">The sales increase has clearly overtaxed the accounting staff, resulting in a rapid expansion of the unmatched receipts suspense account. The controller immediately hires more accounting staff to reconcile the account.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The accounting staff has a strong tendency to resolve easy items in the suspense account while leaving more difficult items for long periods of time. Thus, the unmatched receipts exposure ratio can look quite small, but the suspense account may be full of extremely difficult reconciliation issues that no one wants to touch.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0025">COST OF CREDIT</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The cost of credit is used to determine the cost of not taking a discount offered by a supplier. It is used by the purchasing department as a negotiating tool so that a company can receive a net return on early payments to suppliers. It is also used extensively by the accounts payable staff to verify that the early payment terms offered by suppliers continue to be valid as the company's cost of capital changes. Furthermore, the sales staff uses the calculation in its dealings with the purchasing staffs of other companies, who are also interested in obtaining better early payment discounts.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Determine the proportion of a full year to which the discount period applies. This is the number of days between the end of the early payment period and the date when the payment would normally be due at full price, divided into 360 days. The result is the period over which the discount rate earned by a company is applied. Next, subtract the offered discount percentage from 100%, and divide the result into the discount percentage. This is the effective interest rate that a company will be earning when it takes a supplier-offered discount. Finally, multiply the effective interest rate by the proportion of the full year to which the discount period applies. This yields the annualized cost of the credit being offered by a supplier through its early payment discount. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09040.gif" alt=" " width="537" height="14"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> A supplier of the Newman Astronautics Company is offering early payment terms of 2/15 net 40, which is a discount of 2% if paid within 15 days, with regular payment due after 40 days. Newman's cost of capital is 14%. The accounts payable manager needs to decide if it is economically sensible to take advantage of the discount. The calculation is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09041.gif" alt=" " width="550" height="128"/></p><p class="para">Since the cost of credit of 29.4% is substantially higher than the corporate cost of capital of 14%, this is a good idea. The accounts payable manager authorized taking the early payment discount.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Typically, the cost of credit is compared to a company's cost of capital, which is a blended rate composed of the cost of all corporate debt and equity. In reality, taking a discount tends to be an incremental decision related to the immediate cost of invested funds. For example, an accounts payable manager will draw down cash from a short-term cash supply, typically invested in a money market fund, to take advantage of an early payment discount. This means that the incremental investment trade-off is a few percent of interest earned in the money market fund, rather than the much higher cost of capital for the entire company.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0026">EARNINGS RATE ON INVESTED FUNDS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Most organizations have excess funds available that may be used eventually for working capital or asset purchase requirements, but which are unused at the moment. Others have considerable cash reserves that are being held for larger expenditures, such as acquisitions. In either case, these funds should be invested to derive some rate of return, which can include interest income or an increase in the market value of securities held. The earnings rate on invested funds is a good measurement for tracking the performance of this activity.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Summarize the interest earned on investments, as well as the change in market value of securities held, and divide by the total amount of funds invested. Because the amount of funds invested may fluctuate substantially over the measurement period, the average value can be used. The amount of interest earned should not be based on the actual interest paid to the company, but rather on the accrued amount (since the date of actual payment may fall outside of the measurement period). The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09042.gif" alt=" " width="357" height="34"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Rake and Mow Garden Centers corporate parent is earning a considerable return from its chain of small-town garden centers. Its CFO wants to know its earnings rate on invested funds during the past year. It had $5,500,000 of invested funds at the beginning of the year and $6,200,000 at the end of the year. It earned $75,000 in interest income and had a net gain of $132,000 on its short-term equity investments. Its total earnings rate on invested funds was:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09043.gif" alt=" " width="496" height="136"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> A company can place too much reliance on this measurement, resorting to increasingly risky investments so as to achieve a higher earnings rate. The board of directors must realize that a reasonable, but not spectacular, amount of return is perfectly acceptable, because a company should focus its investment strategy on other goals as well, such as liquidity and minimal loss of principal, which tend to result in lower rates of return.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0027">BROKERAGE FEE PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Banks charge a significant amount of fees to their corporate clients under the guise of many different services, such as wire transfers, incoming check processing, returned check fees, and special reports. It is useful to compare this cost to either the total amount of transactions or the amount of funds invested (in case a broker is involved). Two variations on a brokerage fee percentage calculation are shown in this section.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> If a company is interested in the cost of brokerage transactions, then it should divide the total amount of broker fees charged by the total amount of funds invested in the related account. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09044.gif" alt=" " width="254" height="34"/></p><p class="para">If a company is interested in the cost of all banking fees, which can cover a wide range of activities, then it should summarize all of the bank fees (which are typically listed on the monthly bank statement or a related statement of banking activities) and divide them by the total number of transactions processed that involve a fee. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09045.gif" alt=" " width="304" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Universal Soccer Sports Company is evaluating the performance of its broker, who handles all transactions for its investment account. The amount of money invested with the broker was $1,575,000 at the beginning of the year and $1,705,000 at the end of the year. In the past year, the broker charged $23,625 as a management fee, as well as $16,525 for transactional fees associated with the purchase and sale of securities. The brokerage fee percentage is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09046.gif" alt=" " width="360" height="122"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> There is a great deal of competitive fee information available from brokers who are interested in obtaining a company's investment business. It may be more useful to compare these fees to those charged by the existing broker on a transaction-by-transaction basis, rather than using the more summary-level measurement noted here.</p><p class="para">The same problem applies to the brokerage fee percentage used for banking transactions because there are many types of bank fees, each of which can be compared to those of other banking institutions to determine whether they are reasonable. An additional problem for the banking measurement is that the bulk of all transactions relate to very small check processing fees, which cost very little on a per-transaction basis. When these fees are included in the measurement, they tend to water down the impact of other, larger-fee items. Subdividing the measurement for banking fees so that larger fee items are segregated may consequently be necessary.</p><p class="h1" id="c09-sec1-0028">BORROWING BASE USAGE PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The borrowing base usage percentage is an excellent measure for keeping track of the amount of debt that a company can potentially borrow, based on that portion of its accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets that are not currently being used as collateral for an existing loan. A treasurer, controller, or CFO should have this information available on all standard internal accounting reports so that the company's available debt capacity is easily available. It is particularly useful within a cash budget, indicating not only the amount of any potential cash shortfalls but also the ability of the company to cover those shortfalls with collateralized debt from existing assets.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Multiply the current amount of accounts receivable, less those invoices that are more than 90 days old, by the allowable borrowing base percentage (per the loan document). Then multiply the current amount of inventory, less the obsolescence reserve, by the allowable borrowing base percentage (per the loan document). Add the results of these two calculations together and divide the sum into the amount of debt outstanding. It is also possible to include in the denominator the amount of fixed assets (net of a borrowing base percentage), but many lenders do not allow a company to use fixed assets as part of its collateral, on the grounds that fixed assets are too difficult to liquidate. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu09047.gif" alt=" " width="548" height="41"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Spinning Wheel Company, maker of heirloom-quality spinning wheels, has been in a break-even cash flow situation for a number of years. The market for its products is gradually declining, and the president is searching for alternative products that will shift the company into a more profitable situation. In the meantime, the president needs to know the proportion of debt available under the company's borrowing arrangement, to see how much funding is available to start new lines of business. Under the terms of the loan, the borrowing base percentage is 70% for accounts receivable, 50% for inventory, and 20% for fixed assets.

Do not just calculate the measurement based on the borrowing base percentages contained within the existing lender agreement, howeverâ€”an alternative is to search for another lender that may offer higher borrowing base percentages and calculate it based on those figures as well, on the grounds that the company can change lenders to help it obtain a higher level of debt.</p></div></div>
