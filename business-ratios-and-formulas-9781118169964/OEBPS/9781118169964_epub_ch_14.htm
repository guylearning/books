Since it is so crucial to overall operations and financial viability, its performance should be tracked with several types of ratios and formulas. The measures selected should address not only the sales effectiveness of individual sales staff, but also sales trends by product line, overall market share, and the ability of the company to retain existing customers. The measurements presented in this chapter are:</p><table class="bodytable" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Market Share<br/>Customer Turnover<br/>Advertising Value Equivalency<br/>Net Promoter Score<br/>Browse-to-Buy Conversion Ratio<br/>Recency<br/>Direct Mail Effectiveness Ratio<br/>Inbound Telemarketing Retention Ratio<br/>Proportion of Completed Sales to Home Page Views</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Quote to Close Ratio<br/>Pull-Through Rate<br/>Sales per Salesperson<br/>Sales Productivity<br/>Sales Effectiveness<br/>Sales Trend Percentage by Product Line<br/>Product Demand Elasticity<br/>Days of Backlog</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0001">MARKET SHARE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Company managers may think that the company's sales volume is rising, and yet it may not be keeping pace with the overall sales increases within the market. This is a common occurrence in cases in which market size is rapidly changing. Consequently, a periodic measurement of market share yields an approximate view of a company's sales performance in relation to the market as a whole.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Summarize the dollar volume of all unit sales within a market and divide it by the total dollar volume of industry shipments. This ratio may also be calculated based on unit volumes shipped, rather than dollars. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14001.gif" alt=" " width="239" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Speedy Semiconductor Company has been experiencing exceedingly rapid sales growth for the past few quarters. Its president wants to determine whether this rate of growth is consistent with the growth of its market, or the company is losing pace in comparison to its competitors. The market share data from the Semiconductor Industry Trade Organization and Speedy's sales data for the same period are shown in <a id="c14-tbl-001-1" href="#c14-tbl-001">Table 14.1</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-001" href="#c14-tbl-001-1">TABLE 14.1</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table14001.gif" alt=" " width="558" height="89"/></p><p class="para">The market share ratio shown at the bottom of the table should concern the president of Speedy, for the company's sales growth is not matching the overall size of the market. A reasonable follow-up question for the president would be to determine what other companies in the industry are gaining in market share, since these companies are, in essence, taking sales away from Speedy.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> A company can artificially increase its market share by stuffing sales into its distribution pipeline by offering special pricing arrangements to its distributors; this will artificially increase its market share until the next reporting period, when sales are likely to plunge below their earlier levels (since the distributors are still selling off their extra stocks from the last period), appearing to indicate a sudden reduction in market share. To prevent this problem, the market share calculation can be averaged over several reporting periods.</p><p class="para">Another problem is that the dollar volume of industry shipments can be quite hard to compile and may be inaccurate even when this chore is completed.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0002">CUSTOMER TURNOVER</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This measure is extremely useful for determining the impact of customer service on a company's customers. A very low turnover rate is important in situations in which the cost of acquiring new customers is high.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> The calculation of this formula is subject to some interpretation; the key issue is how long to wait before a customer is assumed to have stopped buying from the company. In some cases, this may be anyone who has not placed an order within the past month and in other cases within the past year. The correct formulation will depend upon the nature of the business. With this in mind, the formula is to subtract from the total customer list those that have been invoiced (or sold to on a cash basis) within the appropriate time and then divide the remainder by the total number of customers on the customer list:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14002.gif" alt=" " width="315" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The customer service department of the Indonesian Linens Company is being inundated with requests from the president to reduce the company's high rate of customer turnover, which is currently 30% per year. The department manager does not have enough staff available to contact all customers regularly, and so asks the controller for assistance in finding out which customers are most important, so that the department can focus on them. Mr. Noteworthy, the controller, conducts an activity-based costing analysis of all customers and determines which 50 customers produce the largest amount of gross margin dollars for the company. The customer service manager gratefully shifts the department's focus to these key customers. A few months later, Mr. Noteworthy calculates customer turnover both in total and for this smaller group of key customers, using the information in <a id="c14-tbl-002-1" href="#c14-tbl-002">Table 14.2</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-002" href="#c14-tbl-002-1">TABLE 14.2</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Total Customer Base</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Key Customer Base</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total number of customers</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">450</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">50</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Customers not placing order in the last three months</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">135</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">5</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Customer turnover</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">30%</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">10%</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The table shows that, although overall customer turnover has not changed, the increased focus on high-profit customers has resulted in greatly reduced turnover in this key area.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> There may be some customers who purchase only small amounts each year; one may not want to include these customers in the turnover calculation, focusing instead on those that provide a significant level of sales volume. Another variation on the ratio is to determine the top customers who provide the company with the bulk of its profits and only measure the turnover rate among that group. By subdividing customers in this manner, a company can focus its customer retention strategy on those who have the largest financial impact on the company.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0003">ADVERTISING VALUE EQUIVALENCY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Should the marketing department spend more money on advertising, or should it spend more time working on obtaining coverage in the media? It is difficult to quantify this decision, so the marketing manager tends to use a historical proportion of what appears to have worked in the past, with a certain amount of funding and time allocated to each one. You can use the advertising value equivalency measure to quantify the value of media coverage, which gives a better way to compare the use of media coverage versus advertising coverage.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Measure the space occupied by the media coverage. This may be in inches for printed coverage, or in seconds or minutes if on an audio or video recording. Then multiply the space or time used for the media coverage by the applicable advertising rate for that amount of space or time. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14003.gif" alt=" " width="473" height="14"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The marketing manager of Eve Bath Products does not know whether she should spend additional time working with the media to obtain favorable coverage of the company, or simply allocate all of her budget to advertising expenditures. She decides to use the advertising value equivalency metric to assign a value to the media coverage she has obtained in the past. In the last month, she obtained media coverage spanning six inches of vertical space in a single column of a major national magazine. The equivalent advertising value of that space was $2,500, which places a value on her media coverage efforts.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This is one of the more difficult metrics to rely upon, because there is some question of whether advertising coverage is equivalent to media coverage. Customers tend to trust media coverage more than advertising, so it is possible that media coverage has a greater value than the advertising that might take up the same space. Also, a highly positive or unfavorable article may have a much higher or lower value than its equivalent advertising value. Furthermore, is there an advertising equivalent for a large article in which a company may only be mentioned in passing?</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0004">NET PROMOTER SCORE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> It is extremely difficult to monitor customer satisfaction, since this can encompass a variety of aspects of the customer experience, such as initial service, pricing, product or service quality, warranty service, and so on. One way to summarize all of these aspects of customer service into one measure is to track the propensity of customers to recommend the company to their friends or colleagues. This approach uses a simple 10-point scale, with a score of 10 representing an enthusiastic endorsement. Surveying on just this question, rather than the usual long list of customer-satisfaction questions, also results in a higher proportion of customer responses.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Conduct a customer survey in which they are asked on a scale of 1 to 10 if they would recommend the company's products and services to their friends or colleagues. Then divide the total of all 9 or 10 scores by the total of all 1 through 6 scores. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14004.gif" alt=" " width="431" height="40"/></p><p class="para">Customers giving scores of 7 or 8 are considered to be passively satisfied, and so are unlikely to either recommend the company or detract from it. Their scores are therefore excluded from the ratio.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Samson Hair Loss Clinic specializes in hair restoration, which is a painful and expensive process. It relies primarily upon customer referrals for new business, so it pays particular attention to customer satisfaction with its services. It recently completed a survey of 100 recent clients, in which they gave scores on a 10-point scale for whether they would recommend Samson to their friends. The results were:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Scores of 9 or 10</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">47</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Scores of 7 or 8</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">18</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">All other scores</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">35</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total respondents</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">100</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The survey resulted in a net promoter score of 1.3:1, which was derived by dividing the 47 scores rated at either 9 or 10 by the 35 scores rated below a 7. The ratio indicates that the clinic still has considerable work to do to improve the experiences of those customers with low scores (and who may actively turn potential customers away with negative recommendations).</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This metric assumes that there is a causal relationship between revenue growth and a high net promoter score. There is likely to be one, given the strength of social networks for selling some types of products. However, people are more likely to go out of their way to recommend consumer products, such as a plasma television, than they are for more pedestrian products, such as cement. Thus, it makes sense to first test the concept on an individual company basis to ensure that this tool represents a valid way to foster more revenue growth.</p><p class="para">If the people being judged by this metric are also the ones collecting the underlying data, then survey results may be skewed upward. To prevent this, have a third party collect the survey information.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0005">BROWSE-TO-BUY CONVERSION RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> In most retail establishments, it is impossible to determine how many people browse through the store, and so there is no way to determine the ratio of potential customers to those who actually make a purchase. This is a simple and effective calculation for any situation in which the store is online, however, since the exact number of browsing customers can be compiled. In this situation, a company has a great deal of interest in the browse-to-buy conversion ratio, since it can adjust its online store presentation to encourage a higher proportion of buyers and get immediate confirmation through this ratio of the effectiveness of its changes.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of buying customers by the number of browsing customers. This measure can be subdivided into individual pages on a website; for example, the measure can be used individually for the camera, television, and video camera sections of an electronics store website. This type of slice-and-dice measurement may yield a greater degree of accuracy in determining which parts of an online store are most effective in attracting customer orders. The ratio is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14005.gif" alt=" " width="203" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> An outside website developer has contacted the International Baby Supply Center, offering to redesign its website to attract more paying customers. The company's lead buyer, Mr. Smythe, decides to structure the deal so that the website developer is paid only if the browse-to-buy conversion ratio improves after the site changes are completed. The developer is willing to modify the web pages depicting products, but not the home page. Accordingly, the number of browsing customers is measured at the product pages rather than at the home page. The development contract states that the developer will be paid 10% of the sales from the increased proportion of buyers for six months following installation of the new web pages. <a id="c14-tbl-003-1" href="#c14-tbl-003">Table 14.3</a> reveals the before-and-after statistics for the site.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-003" href="#c14-tbl-003-1">TABLE 14.3</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Before Changes</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">After Changes</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Number of buying customers</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">10,400</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">17,225</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Number of browsing customers</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">130,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">157,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Browse-to-buy conversion ratio</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">8%</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">11%</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Average sale per customer</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$12</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$15</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The developer's efforts have resulted in an improvement in the ratio of 3%. To calculate the amount to be paid to the developer, Mr. Smythe multiplies the 3% difference by the number of browsing customers after the changes are implemented, which is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14006.gif" alt=" " width="468" height="15"/></p><p class="para">He then multiplies the increase in buying customers by the average sale per customer of $148, to find the amount payable to the developer. The calculation is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14007.gif" alt=" " width="512" height="15"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The number of browsing customers used in the ratio can be subject to a considerable degree of interpretation. For example, it can be summarized from the number of potential customers who access the home page of the site, from the number who access specific product pages, or those who have placed an order but back out just before paying. One possibility is to measure the ratio at all of these points in order to determine where in the process the greatest proportion of potential customers drop out of the purchasing decision.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0006">RECENCY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Recency refers to the time between visits by a customer to a company's retail location. Most stores are not equipped to track the arrival of customers at a store, except for some retail clubs that issue identification cards to their customers. Online stores, however, can easily determine when customers have accessed the site and so have reasonable grounds for calculating this measure. An online store can use the measure as a target for its marketing efforts. By issuing advertisements, special deal notices, and so on, and then noting any changes in the recency measure, a company can determine whether its marketing efforts are changing the purchasing behavior of its customers.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the most recent date of a customer site visit from the date of the last visit date. This number can be summarized and averaged for all customers or for select subgroups of customers.</p><p class="para">The measure can be used for physical retail locations by measuring customer access based on the dates of their noncash purchases; however, this modification to the formula will exclude those customers who have merely browsed through the store and not purchased anything.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Christmas Express Company's marketing manager wants to calculate the recency of the customers accessing its online store. The information for 10 randomly selected customers is shown in <a id="c14-tbl-004-1" href="#c14-tbl-004">Table 14.4</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-004" href="#c14-tbl-004-1">TABLE 14.4</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top">Last Visit Date</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Prior Visit Date</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Recency</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 13</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 2</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">11 Days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 12</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 4</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">8 Days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 10</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 1</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">9 Days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 17</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 16</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1 Day</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 20</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 5</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">15 Days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 9</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 3</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">6 Days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 30</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 10</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">20 Days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 29</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 11</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">18 Days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 27</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 13</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">14 Days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 23</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">August 7</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">16 Days</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The average recency for the information in the far-right column of the table is 11.8 days.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> It may not be that easy to trace the recency of customers at an online site, because they may be accessing the site from different online service providers, which will give them a different identification that cannot be compared to their identifications from previous site visits. The best way to avoid this problem is to require a site log-in using a company-issued identification so that there is no question about who is accessing it.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0007">DIRECT MAIL EFFECTIVENESS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Direct mail campaigns have a high product design, production, and mailing cost, so it is crucial to verify the success of these endeavors. A successful campaign usually has a low single-digit response rate and can swing between a profit or loss if the response rate varies by a fraction of a percent. Consequently, a company that engages in this form of marketing must pay close attention to the direct mail effectiveness ratio.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> This ratio can be measured in two ways. Under the first approach, potential customers do not place an order at the time of the response to the direct mail campaign, and must be contacted to confirm a sale. To measure this type of activity, divide the number of leads generated by the direct mail activity by the number of direct mail pieces issued. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14008.gif" alt=" " width="228" height="40"/></p><p class="para">If customer orders arise straight from a direct mail campaign, then there will be orders instead of sales leads. The ratio then becomes a comparison of direct mail sales to either the number of direct mail pieces issued or the total direct mail expense. Another variation is to compare the gross margin on sales derived from the direct mail campaign to the total direct mail expense. This last version is the most effective for determining whether a profit has been achieved from this activity. The three variations are:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14009.gif" alt=" " width="228" height="169"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The marketing manager of the Curious Gifts Catalog Company wants to measure the performance of her latest direct mail campaign. The relevant information is shown in <a id="c14-tbl-005-1" href="#c14-tbl-005">Table 14.5</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-005" href="#c14-tbl-005-1">TABLE 14.5</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top">Measurement</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Amount</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sales</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$842,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Gross margin</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$379,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Direct mail expense</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$284,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Pieces issued</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2,400,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">With this information, the manager finds that sales per direct mail piece is $0.35 (calculated as $842,000 sales, divided by 2,400,000 pieces issued). The ratio of direct mail sales to related expenses is roughly 3:1 (calculated as $842,000 sales, divided by $284,000 direct mail expense). The most telling comparison is the ratio of gross margin to the direct mail expense of 1.33:1 (calculated as $379,000 gross margin, divided by $284,000 direct mail expense); this last measure shows that there was a reasonable profit resulting from the direct mail campaign.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> If there are multiple direct mail campaigns going on at the same time, it is easy for sales leads or orders derived from them to be mixed up so that it is impossible to tell which campaign was the most effective. To correct this problem, there should be a mailing-specific identification number on each direct mail piece delivered, which should be used to identify each sales lead or order as it is received.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0008">INBOUND TELEMARKETING RETENTION RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This specialized measure is useful only for companies that maintain an inbound telemarketing function, and that have subscription or other recurring forms of revenue. In these cases, customers will likely contact the call center to notify the company that they are canceling their ongoing purchases from it. If so, the company should track the ability of the employees taking those calls to persuade customers not to cancel. The inbound telemarketing retention rate can be used to determine the effectiveness of this activity.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total number of initial customer order cancellation requests into the number of cancellations that have been successfully reversed. Depending upon the situation, this measurement can vary significantly, depending upon which employee is talking to customers; thus, the measure can be effectively used to determine differences in the retention rate between employees in the inbound telemarketing operation. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14010.gif" alt=" " width="367" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Potent Credit Company issues platinum credit cards to a set of wealthy clients. It has recently instituted a no-loss program of offering free credit to any canceling customers for three months in an effort to drop its cancellations as close to zero as possible. It has accumulated the information about the new program shown in <a id="c14-tbl-006-1" href="#c14-tbl-006">Table 14.6</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-006" href="#c14-tbl-006-1">TABLE 14.6</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Before New Program</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">After New Program</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Number of cancellations reversed</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">158</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">797</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total number of cancellations</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1,213</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1,009</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Inbound telemarketing retention rate</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">13%</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">79%</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Cost of retention deals</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$25,800</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$329,161</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Retention cost per reversed cancellation</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$163</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$413</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The table reveals that the company has certainly engineered a drastic improvement in its retention rate, but at a cost of $413 per customer retained. An additional analysis at this point would be to determine the amount of profit to be expected from each customer to determine whether there is an advantage to retaining customers at this much higher cost.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The cost of retaining customers who want to cancel can be significant. For example, a credit card company may offer zero-interest financing on any existing credit card debt for the next few months if a customer agrees to continue using the card; the cost of the interest income lost through this concession is the cost of retaining the customer. It is consequently useful to also track the cost of the deals used to retain customers and then compare this information to the retention rate to determine whether the customer retention effort is worthwhile.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0009">PROPORTION OF COMPLETED SALES TO HOME PAGE VIEWS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A variety of advertising techniques can be used to lure online customers to a company's home page, but converting those customers to completed sales transactions can be extremely difficult. This can involve low price points, a user-friendly interface, easily readable web pages and navigation, and so on. Consequently, it is extremely useful to measure a website's sales capability by comparing the base of customers who initially arrive at a company's home page to the number of sales generated.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the number of page views of the company home page by search-bots from the total number of page views on the home page, and then divide the result into the number of sales transactions on the site during the measurement period. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14011.gif" alt=" " width="429" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Jigsaw Mania Company sells hundreds of custom-designed jigsaw puzzles on the Internet. It is experimenting with a variety of advertising techniques to draw more visitors to its site, and has used just one advertising technique per month so there is no mixing of the results from each approach. Jigsaw has constructed <a id="c14-tbl-007-1" href="#c14-tbl-007">Table 14.7</a> to track the effectiveness of each technique.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-007" href="#c14-tbl-007-1">TABLE 14.7</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table14007.gif" alt=" " width="559" height="142"/></p><p class="para">The results show that a higher volume of customers are drawn to the site through search engines, but that the quality of customer is lower—these page views result in fewer sales. Conversely, the more targeted advertising through the puzzle convention website results in a much higher proportion of sales to home page views. Thus, depending on the cost of advertising, the more targeted ads appear to be the most efficient advertising approach.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Once customers bookmark a company's site as a favorite location, they will have a much higher propensity to purchase from the site, so this ratio will improve over time as customers lock in on the site. However, customer bookmarks may bypass the company's home page and go straight to specific pages on the website, so it may be more useful to use total page views for all entrance pages. An entrance page is the initial page on which a viewer first accesses a website and is commonly tracked by many website statistics packages.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0010">QUOTE TO CLOSE RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The quote to close ratio is one of the most heavily used performance measures by the sales manager. This reveals which sales personnel have the best ability to close a deal once it has been quoted. Though this measures the effectiveness of only one step in the sales funnel, it is nonetheless an important one and can reveal considerable differences between the closing abilities of the various sales staff.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the dollar value of orders received by the total amount of quoted orders. An alternative is to compare the number of orders received to the number quoted, but is not recommended—the ratio can be too easily skewed by a large number of small quotes. Also, given the inordinate length of time that customers sometimes wait before approving an order, this measure needs to be spread over several months to assess a reasonable comparison of quoted to received orders. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14012.gif" alt=" " width="198" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Geomorphics Software Company has had great difficulty in determining the sales effectiveness of its new sales staff. Its software is difficult for the sales staff to learn, and so requires a long time before sales personnel can become effective sellers. The sales manager has hit upon the use of the quote to close ratio on a trend line to figure out if this is a better way to measure their effectiveness. The sales manager has accordingly compiled dollars quoted and orders received information for two new sales personnel, Mr. Brandy and Ms. Browne. Their sales results over a four-month period are shown in <a id="c14-tbl-008-1" href="#c14-tbl-008">Table 14.8</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-008" href="#c14-tbl-008-1">TABLE 14.8</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table14008.gif" alt=" " width="565" height="150"/></p><p class="para">Based on the quote to close ratios for both sales trainees, it appears that Mr. Brandy is gradually improving his ability to close on sales, whereas Ms. Browne is not.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measure can be difficult to use for individual sales personnel, since quotes are frequently made by teams whose composition changes for each quote. In these cases, it can be used only to measure the closing ability of an entire sales team. It is also less effective in cases in which quoted sales comprise only a small fraction of total sales dollars.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0011">PULL-THROUGH RATE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Some salespeople can persuade nearly every customer to make a purchase, while others are far less efficient at converting initial customer contacts into sales. This capability, known as the pull-through rate, is critical for managers who want to increase the sales efficiency of their salespeople, either through the elimination of poor performers or through ongoing sales training.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of customer orders placed by the number of initial customer contacts. It is most effective to measure by individual salesperson or geographic sales location. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14013.gif" alt=" " width="389" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Fifth National Bank's customer service staff is paid a bonus whenever they sign up a caller for additional banking services. To measure the effectiveness of this program, the call center's manager uses call management software to track the number of incoming calls as well as the number of service orders related to those calls. In early June, the bank initiated a sales training program for the call center's staff. Measurement of the pull-through rate during this period yielded the results in <a id="c14-tbl-009-1" href="#c14-tbl-009">Table 14.9</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-009" href="#c14-tbl-009-1">TABLE 14.9</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table14009.gif" alt=" " width="559" height="105"/></p><p class="para">The pull-through measurement indicates that the sales training program had a noticeably positive impact on sales, but the subsequent performance decline in July indicates that further training or some other form of follow-up with the call center staff might be appropriate.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measure is best used in call center environments, because it is easiest to track customers calling in to initiate the buying process as well as actual orders achieved as a result of those calls. It is less effective in unstructured environments (e.g., a retail store), where there is no easy way to record the initial customer contact in a database.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0012">SALES PER SALESPERSON</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Sales per salesperson is the classic measure for determining the sales effectiveness of the sales staff. This measure is commonly used to award bonuses to sales personnel, and to judge which sales staff are retained. However, as noted under the Cautions section, there are several key issues to be aware of that can make this a misleading measure.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Summarize all nonrecurring sales and divide them by the total number of full-time equivalents in the sales department. The resulting measure will yield only average sales per salesperson within the department, which will hide the poor performance of any individual sales staff within the group so one can also calculate the ratio on an individual basis. The measure should not include any recurring sales (as occurs for subscriptions or ongoing insurance sales) since these require little sales effort. Also, the measure should include all sales support staff in the full-time equivalents number in the denominator, even though they are not actively selling—they are key to supporting the sales staff and their absence will affect sales effectiveness, so they should be included. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14014.gif" alt=" " width="199" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Ski &amp; Snowboard Magazine Emporium's sales manager is concerned about the performance of its salespeople, Ms. Dunriddy and Ms. Enoch. They both have identical total sales, but one is relying on recurring magazine subscriptions for a larger proportion of her sales, which results in a much slower rate of sales growth for the company. The sales manager compiles the information shown in <a id="c14-tbl-0010-1" href="#c14-tbl-0010">Table 14.10</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-0010" href="#c14-tbl-0010-1">TABLE 14.10</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Ms. Dunriddy</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Ms. Enoch</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Recurring sales</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$150,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$25,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">New sales</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$100,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$225,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total sales</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$250,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$250,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sales per salesperson</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$250,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$250,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The information in the table suggests that Ms. Enoch is the newer of the two salespeople and is striving to increase sales much more rapidly so she can derive a benefit in later years from the commission rate on recurring subscriptions. Alternatively, Ms. Dunriddy has already built up her recurring subscription base and is coasting along with minimal effort to attract new sales. To provide a greater incentive for both salespeople, the sales manager reduces the commission on recurring subscriptions and increases it on new subscriptions.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The primary concern is that the sales staff may alter their sales behavior so thoroughly as to maximize their performance under this measurement that actual profits decline. For example, a salesperson may focus on selling a product with a high price rather than a lower-priced product that carries a much higher gross margin. Another example is when a salesperson gives away so many other items in order to secure a sale, such as long payment terms or free maintenance, that gross margins are driven down even when sales remain high. A third example is when the sales staff indulges in the excessive use of travel and entertainment expenses to secure sales, once again driving down profitability. Finally, it is common for sales personnel to secure orders from customers with a minimal ability to pay for the goods and then browbeat the in-house credit department in order to secure the extension of credit to these customers. For all of these reasons, the sales per salesperson measurement can easily result in salesperson behavior that does not maximize profits. If it is possible to measure profitability by salesperson (a sometimes complex endeavor, since the chart of accounts is rarely set up to provide this information), then this is a much better way to control the selling behavior of the sales employees.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0013">SALES PRODUCTIVITY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Part of the problem with the preceding sales by salesperson measurement is that a salesperson can focus on sales of high-cost, low-margin products in order to make the measure look good, even though the company earns only a small margin on the sales. The sales productivity measure can better show the ability of the sales force to sell those products having the highest margins with the least amount of sales expense. This is an excellent method for determining bonuses or employee retention within the sales department.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the variable cost of goods sold from new sales and divide the result by the sales expense. This measure should be used for each of the sales staff, since sales productivity can vary considerably within the department. Also, the sales figure within the formula should only be for nonrecurring revenue (i.e., new sales), so that the sales staff does not receive credit for renewal billings for which they expended no sales effort. The sales expense used in the calculation should include the base pay, commission, travel and entertainment, and all other directly traceable costs of the sales staff. It should not include any overhead allocation, since this is not a direct cost of making a sale. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14015.gif" alt=" " width="330" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The manager of a sales department has been informed that one of the three sales staff must be laid off. To determine performance, the manager decides to measure their sales productivity. The manager collects information that covers the sales performance of the sales staff for the past year, which is shown in <a id="c14-tbl-0011-1" href="#c14-tbl-0011">Table 14.11</a>. </p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-0011" href="#c14-tbl-0011-1">TABLE 14.11</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table14011.gif" alt=" " width="558" height="115"/></p><p class="para">The table reveals that, although Salesperson A sells the most volume, the products have a lower gross margin than those being sold by the other two sales staff. Also, Salesperson A is spending far more money to secure sales than are the other two sales employees. This results in the worst sales productivity ratio (of 2.7:1) for Salesperson A, while Salesperson C, who has the lowest sales volume, has achieved the highest sales productivity score. Based on this information, Salesperson A should be laid off.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Using this calculation, it is possible that an introductory-level, low-paid salesperson who achieves a modest amount of sales could theoretically achieve a higher sales productivity score than a more experienced salesperson with a higher base pay, because the sales expense portion of the calculation is so much lower. Also, this measure does not address the issue of sales being made that affect a company's bottleneck production operation. This is covered in the next measurement.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0014">SALES EFFECTIVENESS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> An alternative way to measure the ability of the sales staff is to sell products that avoid use of the company's chief production constraint. If too many products are sold that require a large proportion of constraint time, then a company will soon find itself unable to increase sales without a large investment to increase the size of the constraint. However, if the sales employees are made aware of the amount of constraint time used by each product, then this measure can be used to determine how well they avoid the constraint.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the variable cost of goods sold from gross revenue and then divide the result by the amount of constraint time used to produce the items sold. A key factor is determining which costs within the cost of goods sold are truly variable. In many instances, only material costs are variable, with even direct labor costs being fixed in the short term. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14016.gif" alt=" " width="278" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Hard Rock Candy Company has maximized the output from its bottleneck operation, which is a candy cooker, and cannot produce a higher level of output without purchasing an additional cooker. The president instructs the salespeople to shift their efforts into product sales that require less cooker time. The president compiles in <a id="c14-tbl-0012-1" href="#c14-tbl-0012">Table 14.12</a> before-and-after information about the salespeople's performance to determine whether they are following his instructions.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-0012" href="#c14-tbl-0012-1">TABLE 14.12</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Before</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">After</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Gross revenue</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,000,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$950,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Variable cost of goods sold</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$750,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$700,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Constraint time used</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">168 hours</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">153 hours</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sales effectiveness</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,488/hr</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,634/hr</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The table reveals that the salesperson has achieved a slightly lower level of sales but has altered the gross margin mix, so the same gross margin (of $250,000) has been achieved both before and after the change in sales instructions. The primary change is that the number of hours of cooker time required by the sales has dropped from 168 hours to 153, which means that the gross margin earned per hour of constraint time has increased from $1,488 per hour to $1,634 per hour. In short, the salesperson is appropriately following the president's instructions.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> It can be difficult to accumulate the information needed to operate this measurement in an effective manner. A company must accurately determine its variable cost of goods sold and be able to efficiently trace it back to individual product sales as well as inform the sales staff of the constraint usage times for each product. This can also require a significant revamping of the sales compensation plan so as to shift salesperson efforts away from usage of the constraint.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0015">SALES TREND PERCENTAGE BY PRODUCT LINE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The marketing and engineering departments need to know how the sales of each of a company's product lines are progressing so they can alter their marketing positioning, sales concepts, and product features in coordination with the perceived position of each product in its life cycle. For example, if sales are steady or dropping, then the engineering department should use this information to design a replacement or enhanced version of the existing product that will spur sales when introduced.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract total sales dollars in the previous period from those in the current period and divide the result by total sales in the previous period. This yields the percentage change in sales during the period. The measure can also be based on the number of units sold, but ignores the price point at which sales are made and so yields less information. This measure is best used for an entire product line rather than for individual products, since there may be so many products and accessories within a product line, including many that are cannibalizing sales from one another, that the multitude of resulting ratios will not yield any useful information. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14017.gif" alt=" " width="400" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Nomicon Office Seating Company has designed a deluxe office chair, the Flexomatic, that has seen skyrocketing sales for the last few years. However, competitors have brought out two comparable models that will soon cut into the unit volume on sales of the Flexomatic. The sales manager consequently wants to keep close track of its sales trend to spot the point at which sales are trailing off. The relevant information for the past four months is shown in <a id="c14-tbl-0013-1" href="#c14-tbl-0013">Table 14.13</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-0013" href="#c14-tbl-0013-1">TABLE 14.13</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table14013.gif" alt=" " width="559" height="108"/></p><p class="para">The sales trend percentage for the Flexomatic reveals a potential problem in the most recent month of April, when the rate of sales growth dropped from the usual 50% rate to 33%. If this reduced sales trend were to continue much longer, the sales manager might consider dropping the Flexomatic price to become more competitive with the other models on the market.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Changes in sales levels from period to period may be closely tied to promotional, seasonal, or pricing changes and so must be reviewed with these issues in mind. To prevent this problem, a sales trend could be compared to the same trend calculation for the period in the previous year, along with a commentary on changes in marketing and engineering efforts in the interim that might have had an impact on sales.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0016">PRODUCT DEMAND ELASTICITY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This is useful for determining the ability of a company to maximize its profit on product sales by altering prices. As noted under the Cautions section, however, there are so many other variables affecting sales effectiveness besides price that this measurement's effectiveness is restricted.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the percentage change in quantity of product sold by the percentage change in price. The product demand is considered to be inelastic if the result of the measurement is greater than 100%, and elastic if it is less than 100%. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14018.gif" alt=" " width="201" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Meridian Vacuum Company has been selling an industrial-grade vacuum cleaner for a number of years at a price of $250 per unit. After comparing this product to the competition, Meridian's marketing team believes that it can spend only $25 to reposition the vacuum as a premium product with an aluminum casing. At a gross margin of 50%, this means that the product's price must increase by $50, to $300. Also, because of its repositioning as a premium product, the marketing staff would like to increase its price further, to $325. A marketing test at this price point reveals that the number of units sold declines from 5,000 to 4,000 as a result of the increased price. Is this product price elastic or inelastic? Use the preceding formula to find out:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14019.gif" alt=" " width="261" height="167"/></p><p class="para">The measurement reveals that the suggested price increase will result in a smaller proportional drop in unit sales. The new price point should consequently be implemented.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> There are many factors that go into a consumer's decision to purchase a product besides price, all of which render the product demand elasticity measure difficult to determine. For example, a customer may pay a higher price simply because it is offered more lenient credit terms by the seller. Also, a seller that has established a high-quality brand name through extensive marketing efforts can command a premium on its product sales. Furthermore, differences in product quality may shift the buying habits of consumers when faced with otherwise similar products. Also, if there are substitute products available, then prices will be driven down to match those of the substitute. For these reasons, it tends to be difficult to use this measurement except when large pricing changes are implemented that will overwhelm all the other factors noted here.</p><p class="h1" id="c14-sec1-0017">DAYS OF BACKLOG</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The days of backlog measure is extremely important for the production department, because this group can use it to determine the amount of production capacity that should be made available in the short term. It is also useful from a financial planning standpoint, since it shows likely short-term changes in sales that will affect reported financial results. It can also be used to project production outsourcing needs, when the amount of backlog exceeds a company's short-term productive capacity.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Determine the amount of annual sales, divide it by 365, and divide the result into the dollar total of all unfilled sales orders. The annual sales figure may include budgeted sales through the end of the year, which may vary considerably from actual results. The latest 12 months of sales results on a rolling basis can be used to avoid an unrealistic annual sales figure. Also, be careful not to include any projected sales in the backlog figure for which firm orders have not yet been received from customers, since the intent of this measurement is to obtain a realistic understanding of actual orders that have not yet been filled. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu14020.gif" alt=" " width="203" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The MicroMelt Plastics Company management team is considering adding capacity to its line of 50-ton injection molding machines. It will do this only if there is a clear trend of an increasing backlog in sales that can be run through this type of machine. To determine whether this is the case, the controller compiles information for the last four quarters (see <a id="c14-tbl-0014-1" href="#c14-tbl-0014">Table 14.14</a>).</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c14-tbl-0014" href="#c14-tbl-0014-1">TABLE 14.14</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table14014.gif" alt=" " width="556" height="86"/></p><p class="para">The days of backlog in the preceding table reveals that, although the dollar volume of the sales backlog is increasing, existing production capacity has actually been able to reduce the number of days of backlog. This may eliminate the short-term need for additional equipment; however, the company should review the percentage of capacity utilization on each existing machine to determine whether they are reaching their maximum sustainable levels of production. If so, then it may still be necessary to buy more production equipment if sales levels are expected to increase in the future.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The backlog figure should be separated into in-house production work and product resales, because resales require no in-house production capacity. Also, this can be a misleading measurement, for it ignores the amount of sales that must pass through a company's bottleneck operation. If the mix of sales within the backlog requires a large amount of processing time at the bottleneck operation, a company may find itself unable to handle the existing backlog even if the total backlog appears to be low.</p></div></div>
