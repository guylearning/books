One is a database of accounting information, in which an analyst can roam for days, tracking down the details regarding when specific transactions have taken place, why they occurred, and the likelihood of their happening again. Analysts rarely descend straight into the depths of the accounting database, however, without first using some more simple means for determining what problem has arisen, which yields clues regarding where in the database to search. This higher-level information is obtained by using ratio and trend analysis to pinpoint the issue. To get this information, a calculator, pencil, and paper are sufficient, but also very time consuming and prone to error. An electronic spreadsheet instead is the best method. In this chapter, we review how to use such a spreadsheet—in this case, the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, version 2000.</p><p class="para">The formulas presented in this chapter are by no means difficult. The discussion is confined to the simplest and most understandable spreadsheet commands, and avoids the use of complicated macros. The discussion focuses on using spreadsheets for five types of analysis: financial statements, project analysis, investment analysis, risk analysis, and trend analysis. In each case, it is noted how Excel can be used to solve a problem, and then a sample situation is provided.</p><p class="para">A key issue noted throughout this chapter is the difference between a spreadsheet and a worksheet. In Excel, a spreadsheet can have a number of interlinked layers known as worksheets. When an entry is made in one worksheet, it can be referenced by other worksheets in the same spreadsheet. This is a preferable approach to using Excel for financial analysis, since one can separate the data being analyzed in one worksheet, ratios in another, and graphics in yet another worksheet—but with formulas linking all of them together. In the examples used in the first few sections of this chapter, nearly all of the analysis is done on one spreadsheet that contains a half-dozen worksheets.</p><p class="h1" id="c15-sec1-0001">FINANCIAL STATEMENT PROPORTIONAL ANALYSIS</p><p class="paraaftertitle">Proportional analysis is simply converting all of the numbers in an income statement and balance sheet into percentages so they can be compared over time to see what differences arise. By conducting this analysis, one can determine whether there are trends in revenues, costs, assets, or liabilities that may require further analysis or investigation.</p><p class="para">When using Excel to conduct a proportional analysis of a financial statement, one must first input the income statement for each period into the worksheet so that the proportional analysis calculation will appear below it or on a separate worksheet. In <a id="c15-fig-0001-1" href="#c15-fig-0001">Exhibit 15.1</a>, a simplified income statement has been entered in the cells at the top of the worksheet. For each line item in this top section, there is a formula entered in the replicated income statement at the bottom of the screen that divides each expense line item by the revenue figure, resulting in a percentage of sales for each item. For example, the materials cost proportion for the month of January is calculated with the following formula, which is entered in cell B15:</p><div class="figure"><p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c15-fig-0001" href="#c15-fig-0001-1">Exhibit 15.1</a></span> Proportional Analysis of an Income Statement</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/nc15f001.jpg" alt="ch15fig001.eps" width="550" height="415"/></div><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn15001.gif" alt=" " width="54" height="13"/></p><p class="para">Since the spreadsheet contains the income statement for multiple months, the resulting proportional analysis becomes very useful for finding any trends in the expenses being incurred over the course of the year.</p><p class="para">The income statement proportional analysis used in the preceding example would be of great use to management in determining why its profits are not increasing along with its evident sales growth. In the example, sales increase from $1,200 in January to $1,400 in August, but profits drop by $9. Why? By perusing the proportional analysis, it is an easy matter to see that the cost of materials has dropped as a percentage of sales, which may reflect excellent purchasing, design, or production work to lower these costs. For the answer to why profits have dropped, we must look lower in the spreadsheet. The direct labor cost as a proportion of sales has risen, so this is an obvious target area for further analysis. However, the overall gross margin percentage has dropped by only 1% over the time being analyzed, so there must be more trouble further down in the income statement. Sure enough, the administrative expenses line item reveals a 3% jump in costs. Accordingly, anyone using this analysis would conclude that the trouble has arisen in the direct labor and administrative areas, and that the materials expense requires no further analysis.</p><p class="para">Though this type of analysis is an excellent way to home in on key areas, it is rarely the final analysis conducted, since it does not reveal enough information. Also, it is not sufficient if there are many operating divisions rolled into the income statement. In these cases, it is best to create a number of separate spreadsheets, one for each division, and conduct the analysis on each one, thereby yielding a greater level of detail regarding problem areas.</p><p class="para">The same proportional analysis can be applied to the balance sheet. In <a id="c15-fig-0002-1" href="#c15-fig-0002">Exhibit 15.2</a>, one can manually enter a simplified version of the balance sheet at the top of the spreadsheet, which produces a set of percentages at the bottom. The asset percentages sum to the grand total of all assets, while the percentages for liabilities and equity sum to the total for those two categories.</p><div class="figure"><p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c15-fig-0002" href="#c15-fig-0002-1">Exhibit 15.2</a></span> Proportional Analysis of a Balance Sheet</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/nc15f002.jpg" alt="nc15f002.eps" width="550" height="456"/></div><p class="para">As was the case for the proportional analysis of the income statement, the cell formula is extremely simple. In <a href="#c15-fig-0002">Exhibit 15.2</a>, the percentage for accounts payable in April is calculated by dividing the total accounts payable dollars, located in cell E10, by the total of all liabilities and equity for that month, which is located in cell E14.</p><p class="para">What does the proportional analysis of the balance sheet tell us? To use the example, there is a clear increase in the fixed asset investment, which requires the use of all cash, as well as an increased debt load, which reaches its height in May, after which cash flow from operations is used to gradually draw down the level of debt. The only other trend of note is that inventory levels are declining, which indicates either excellent logistics practices or a decline in sales that no longer requires such a large supporting base of inventory. Consequently, a great deal can be discerned by reviewing a proportional balance sheet analysis.</p><p class="h1" id="c15-sec1-0002">FINANCIAL STATEMENT RATIO ANALYSIS</p><p class="paraaftertitle">Perhaps the most common use of an electronic spreadsheet is to conduct a ratio analysis of the income statement and balance sheets. Summary forms of the income statement and balance sheet are typically located at the top of the worksheet, with ratios located at the bottom that are derived from these two reports. By using this approach, one can quickly enter the summary-level financial information for the current reporting period and then see the related ratios appear at the bottom of the worksheet. In a few moments, he or she has access to a rough analysis of company operations. If there are entries for the financial results of previous months, then one can also see trend lines in ratio results that extend through to the current reporting period.</p><p class="para">As an example of the types of ratio analysis one can use in a worksheet, we will use the income statement and balance sheet shown earlier, in <a href="#c15-fig-0001">Exhibits 15.1</a> and <a href="#c15-fig-0002">15.2</a>. A series of ratios is noted in <a id="c15-fig-0003-1" href="#c15-fig-0003">Exhibit 15.3</a> that is derived from those statements.</p><div class="figure"><p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c15-fig-0003" href="#c15-fig-0003-1">Exhibit 15.3</a></span> Ratio Analysis Based on an Income Statement and Balance Sheet</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/nc15f003.jpg" alt="nc15f003.eps" width="550" height="415"/></div><p class="para">In <a href="#c15-fig-0001">Exhibit 15.3</a>, there are several tabs itemized at the bottom of the worksheet. Each one represents another spreadsheet that is clustered into the same workbook. The first tab, titled IS, contains a spreadsheet version of the income statement. The second tab, titled BS, contains a spreadsheet version of the balance sheet. The ratios shown in the exhibit are compiled by referencing the cell locations in these two spreadsheets and listing the result on the current Ratios spreadsheet.</p><p class="para">The formulas behind the ratios in <a href="#c15-fig-0003">Exhibit 15.3</a> are not shown, so the same spreadsheet is laid out differently in <a id="c15-fig-0004-1" href="#c15-fig-0004">Exhibit 15.4</a> to provide this information. In this example, we have eliminated the formulas for all but the month of January, and then listed each formula in full. For example, the first ratio is the Quick Ratio, which compares easily liquidated assets to current liabilities. To obtain this information, the cell entry goes to the BS spreadsheet and adds together cells B4 and B5, which contain the cash and accounts receivable figures for the month of January. The formula then divides the sum by the accounts payable and accrued liabilities amounts, which are located on the same spreadsheet in cells B10 and B11.</p><div class="figure"><p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c15-fig-0004" href="#c15-fig-0004-1">Exhibit 15.4</a></span> Formulas for Previous Ratio Analysis</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/nc15f004.jpg" alt="nc15f004.eps" width="550" height="433"/></div><p class="para">Further down in the list of ratios are ones that are built upon the income statement. For example, the Return on Sales percentage is derived by referencing the profit figure for January, which is located in cell B11 in the IS spreadsheet, and dividing by total sales, which is located in cell B4 in the same spreadsheet. Finally, we can mix references to both the IS and BS spreadsheets in the same ratio formula. For example, to arrive at the return on equity, the formula takes the profit for January, which is located in cell B11 in the IS spreadsheet, annualizes it by multiplying by 12, and divides it by the equity figure, which is located in cell B13 in the BS spreadsheet. Thus, we can mix cell references from a variety of spreadsheets to arrive at a centralized set of ratios that can be stored in a single spreadsheet location.</p><p class="h1" id="c15-sec1-0003">AUTOMATED RATIO RESULT ANALYSIS</p><p class="paraaftertitle">If there are a great many ratios linked to a set of financial statements, one may want to save time in reviewing them by having the spreadsheet issue a warning message for those ratios that fall outside a preset parameter. Another reason for using this approach is when a lending institution places constraints on a company by requiring minimum levels for certain ratios, such as a current ratio of at least 2:1, or a debt to equity ratio of no more than 30%. In either case, a formula that presents a YES/NO or GOOD/BAD result can save some time.</p><p class="para">A simple IF formula will create an automated ratio result. To continue with the example used previously in <a href="#c15-fig-0004">Exhibit 15.4</a>, we will add three rows to the analysis. Under the Balance Sheet Ratios section, add a row titled Meets Quick Ratio Covenant? This is a YES/NO determination based on the quick ratio being greater than 0.9, and will appear in row 8. The formula for the month of January will be:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn15002.gif" alt=" " width="142" height="15"/></p><p class="para">Under the Income Statement Ratios section, add a row titled Meets Gross Margin Covenant? This is a YES/NO determination based on the gross margin being greater than 43% and will appear in row 14. The formula for the month of January will be:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn15003.gif" alt=" " width="159" height="15"/></p><p class="para">Under the Mixed Ratios section, add a row titled Meets Inventory Turnover Covenant? This is a YES/NO determination based on the inventory turnover level being greater than 21 and will appear in row 22. The formula for the month of January will be:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn15004.gif" alt=" " width="155" height="15"/></p><p class="para">All of these new formulations are shown in the ratios exhibit in <a id="c15-fig-0005-1" href="#c15-fig-0005">Exhibit 15.5</a>. In the exhibit, one can quickly skim through the various months of results to determine the occasions when covenants have been violated. Setting up the IF statements that drive these automated ratio results is quite simple, and can help to some extent in the task of sorting through large quantities of ratios.</p><div class="figure"><p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c15-fig-0005" href="#c15-fig-0005-1">Exhibit 15.5</a></span> Automated Ratio Results Analysis</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/nc15f005.jpg" alt="nc15f005.eps" width="550" height="433"/></div><p class="h1" id="c15-sec1-0004">LEVERAGE ANALYSIS</p><p class="paraaftertitle">An additional concept that can be added onto the preceding discussion of ratios is leverage analysis. There are several types of leverage analysis, all of which can be converted into formulas and added to a ratio analysis, as will be shown in this section.</p><p class="para">The first type of analysis is of operating leverage. Under this concept, we determine the extent to which a percentage change in sales results in a different percentage change in profits. For example, if all costs were totally variable, there would be a percentage change in profits that would exactly match the change in sales, which would result in an operating leverage ratio of 1:1. However, if the bulk of costs are fixed, and will therefore not change when there are changes in sales, then an increase in sales will result in a more rapid increase in profits. For example, if a 10% increase in sales results in a 20% increase in profits, then the operating leverage ratio is 2:1. This is a wonderful condition to have when sales are on the increase, since large profit jumps will occur. However, the inverse situation arises if sales decline, since fixed costs must still be paid even when sales drop, which results in inordinate profit decreases. Thus, a large operating leverage ratio is a two-edged sword that cuts deeply in a declining sales situation. To measure this, we can create a measurement for the degree of operating leverage, which is calculated by dividing the percentage change in profits (before interest and taxes) by the percentage change in sales. The reason for excluding interest and tax costs is that we are determining only the amount of leverage based on operations, and neither of these expenses is related to operations. This measure has been added to the ratio analysis previously shown in <a href="#c15-fig-0003">Exhibit 15.3</a>, and is now listed in an expanded format in <a id="c15-fig-0006-1" href="#c15-fig-0006">Exhibit 15.6</a>.</p><div class="figure"><p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c15-fig-0006" href="#c15-fig-0006-1">Exhibit 15.6</a></span> Leverage Ratios</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/nc15f006.jpg" alt="nc15f006.eps" width="550" height="433"/></div><p class="para"><a href="#c15-fig-0006">Exhibit 15.6</a> also includes another ratio. This measures the same concept, but this time it is the relationship between earnings per share and profits. The measure divides the percentage change in earnings per share by the percentage change in earnings before interest and taxes. Since the earnings per share figure includes interest and taxes as well as changes in the number of shares outstanding, the earnings figure does not include any of these variables, so any differences in the percentages of change between the two measures can be caused only by interest, taxes, or the number of shares. Since all of these items are finance-related issues, we call this the <span class="italic">financial leverage ratio</span>. In short, any leverage indicated by this ratio is caused by financial manipulation rather than changes in a company's operational structure.</p><p class="para">The leverage measures outlined here are only general measures, and yield no more than a high-level understanding of the reasons for changes in profitability levels. Much more detailed analysis is needed to gain a true understanding of the specific types of costs and other factors that drive operating and financial leverage.</p><p class="h1" id="c15-sec1-0005">TREND ANALYSIS</p><p class="paraaftertitle">An electronic spreadsheet is one of the best tools to use for the analysis of trends, because one can enter a list of time-sequenced data in a spreadsheet and generate a graphical trend line from it in a few moments. Virtually any type of revenue or cost can be itemized and graphed on a spreadsheet, so trend analysis becomes one of the simplest functions with this tool. To continue with the income statement example shown earlier in <a href="#c15-fig-0001">Exhibit 15.1</a>, we will select the sales, gross margin, and net income figures for trend analysis on three different graphs, all of which will be located on a new spreadsheet called Graphs. They are shown in <a id="c15-fig-0007-1" href="#c15-fig-0007">Exhibit 15.7</a>.</p><div class="figure"><p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c15-fig-0007" href="#c15-fig-0007-1">Exhibit 15.7</a></span> Graphical Presentation of Trend Lines</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/nc15f007.jpg" alt="nc15f007.eps" width="405" height="550"/></div><p class="para">All of the graphs shown in <a href="#c15-fig-0007">Exhibit 15.7</a> were created using the same set of five steps in Excel, which are as follows:</p><div class="list"><p class="listnumbered"><span class="bold">1.</span> Go to the IS worksheet in the example and highlight the range of numbers to be graphed on a trend line.</p><p class="listnumbered"><span class="bold">2.</span> Click on the Chart Wizard icon.</p><p class="listnumbered"><span class="bold">3.</span> Select Chart Type = Column.</p><p class="listnumbered"><span class="bold">4.</span> Enter the name of the graph in the Chart Title field.</p><p class="listnumbered"><span class="bold">5.</span> Set the Legend option to Off.</p></div><p class="para">The Chart Wizard also gives the option of storing the finished graph on any worksheet within the current spreadsheet, or on a different spreadsheet entirely. It is generally best to not store the graph on the current worksheet, since printouts may inadvertently include the underlying data. In the example, all three graphs draw their data from the IS worksheet and store the finished product in the Graphs worksheet.</p><p class="para">The Chart Wizard function is an exceptionally simple guide to creating trend analysis, and is an excellent supporting tool for one who is not only creating a trend analysis, but also presenting the information in a tasteful format for presentation purposes.</p><p class="h1" id="c15-sec1-0006">FORECASTING</p><p class="paraaftertitle">One is sometimes called upon to make sales forecasts or verify those made by the sales and marketing departments. One of the better approaches for doing this is to extend the past history of sales volume forward into the periods being projected. Although this method of prediction is like trying to drive a car by looking in the rear-view mirror, it is still one of the best tools available, as long as it is supplemented by detailed conversations with the sales staff to see what is really happening in the marketplace.</p><p class="para">There are two formulas provided by Excel that result in forecast information. The first, and simplest, is the TREND command. This one superimposes a trend line on an existing set of time-sequenced data points to arrive at an expected sales level for a specified future period. To illustrate the command, we return once again to the income statement shown earlier in <a href="#c15-fig-0001">Exhibit 15.1</a>. We will use a new worksheet within the same spreadsheet, called Trend, and reference in it all of the monthly sales figures from the previous income statement. This is shown in <a id="c15-fig-0008-1" href="#c15-fig-0008">Exhibit 15.8</a>, along with a graph that shows the added trend line.</p><div class="figure"><p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c15-fig-0008" href="#c15-fig-0008-1">Exhibit 15.8</a></span> Trend Line Analysis</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/nc15f008.jpg" alt="nc15f009.eps" width="453" height="550"/></div><p class="para">In the worksheet in <a href="#c15-fig-0008">Exhibit 15.8</a>, we already know all sales data points from January through August, and want to calculate a trend line that extends an additional month to give us a prediction for September sales. Accordingly, in the table of months and historical sales figures noted in the Trend worksheet, there is an additional cell next to the “August” sales period. In that cell, we enter the following formula:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn15005.gif" alt=" " width="206" height="15"/></p><p class="para">Though it looks complicated, this is a relatively simple command. The trend line is based on the data points contained in cells B4 through B11 for the date ranges contained in cells A4 through A11. The date for the period to be forecast is noted in cell A12. The formula generates a number that is the extension of the trend shown by the previous data elements and will deposit this number in the B12 cell. Another way to state the formula is to ignore the dates and just ask for the next number in sequence. The formula, based on the previous example, looks like this:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn15006.gif" alt=" " width="156" height="16"/></p><p class="para">Under this variation, we are using the same set of data points, but ignoring the dates (hence the two commas in the formula with no data in between), and a number in brackets that represents the trend for the ninth number in the sequence of data elements. Since the original set of data included only eight data elements, this will be the next revenue figure after the last month of actual data. If the requested trend were for the month of December, the number in brackets would change to { 12} , since this would represent the twelfth data point in the series.</p><p class="para">To show this information in a graph, use the same series of steps noted for the graphs previously presented for <a href="#c15-fig-0007">Exhibit 15.7</a>. To add a trend line overlay to the presented data, however, click on the completed graph, move the cursor to the revenue line on the chart, and press the right mouse button. Then click on the Add Trendline option, and pick from six available types of trend lines that can be added to the graph.</p><p class="para">The second type of forecasting tool provided by Excel is regression analysis. This is a powerful tool for determining the trend line that best fits a disparate set of data, and is most useful when dealing with a set of numbers that are widely scattered, and show no apparent pattern. In essence, the method determines the trend line that minimizes the sum of all squared errors between all data points and the line. Rather than delve into the formula for this method, it is easiest to plot the data elements and proceed immediately to a graph, on which Excel will superimpose a regression trend line. In <a href="#c15-fig-0008">Exhibit 15.8</a>, the second half of the presentation includes the regression analysis. In it, we have plotted 20 data items for 20 periods that are wildly different from each other, and have no apparent pattern. The first step in the analysis is to create a graph, using the same methods noted earlier for <a href="#c15-fig-0007">Exhibit 15.7</a>. Then use the same steps just described for the TREND analysis to add a trend line to the chart. The result is shown in the bottom half of <a href="#c15-fig-0008">Exhibit 15.8</a>, where we find that there is a slight upward trend line to the data used to compile the regression trend line.</p><p class="para">Of the two methods presented, the TREND formula is of the greater use, for one will find that most data being analyzed in the financial arena has a lengthy and steady trend line of data. Only for the most unusual analyses, involving wildly disparate data items, will the regression analysis be necessary.</p><p class="para">The following list<a id="c15-note-002-1" href="#c15-note-002">†</a> shows some of the trend lines that one should consider using when measuring a company's operations:</p><ul class="list"><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Trend of amount of utilized storage space.</span> This trend can spotlight many contributing problems, such as obsolete inventory, returned goods, scrapped parts, and excess finished goods.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Trend of cost of distribution channels.</span> This analysis should include the net margins earned on each sales channel.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Trend of cost of freight.</span> A company may extend into new geographical regions without considering the cost of shipping product into those areas. This analysis should be conducted by region to spot such problems.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Trend of cost of sales calls.</span> In particular, one should compare the relationship between the sales received from high-volume customers and the cost of making sales calls to them.

We now move to other Excel functions that are primarily used for the evaluation of capital projects, investments, and risk analysis.</p><p class="h1" id="c15-sec1-0007">CASH FLOW ANALYSIS</p><p class="paraaftertitle">When evaluating a capital asset proposal, there are many factors to review, such as expected market conditions, sales estimates, salvage values, and maintenance costs. After all of these items have been reviewed and substantiated, they must all be input into a cash flow projection model to see if the project returns an adequate amount of cash. Excel supplies a formula that makes this an easy task once the stream of all cash flows has been entered into a spreadsheet. A sample of such an analysis is shown in <a id="c15-fig-0009-1" href="#c15-fig-0009">Exhibit 15.9</a>, where we have simulated a typical cash-generating project that involves a significant up-front expenditure to purchase and set up equipment, five years of progressively larger positive cash flows as more equipment capacity is used, and then additional costs at the end of the project to dismantle the equipment, which is net of salvage value.</p><div class="figure"><p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c15-fig-0009" href="#c15-fig-0009-1">Exhibit 15.9</a></span> Net Present Value Calculation</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/nc15f009.jpg" alt="nc15f009.eps" width="550" height="389"/></div><p class="para">Once this information is stored in a spreadsheet, we add the net present value formula, which is derived as follows:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn15007.gif" alt=" " width="314" height="15"/></p><p class="para">The interest rate used in the formula should be the incremental cost of capital. The range of cash flow values listed in the second part of the formula represent the net cash flows for each period of the analysis. The formula then determines the current value of the expected future cash flows for each future period, using the cost of capital as the discounting factor, and summarizes all of the separate discounted cash flows into a single dollar value of all cash flows for the project. In the example, the formula uses a cost of capital of 13%, which results in the following formula:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn15008.gif" alt=" " width="108" height="15"/></p><p class="para">The NPV formula is a powerful tool for determining the discounted cash flows of projects, but one must keep in mind that the cash flows used in these models are highly subjective in nature (depending on the extent of previous analysis work), which results in net present values that appear to be accurate to the nearest penny, but which do not have solid quantitative underpinnings, which yields inaccurate results. For example, the cash flow analysis shown earlier in <a href="#c15-fig-0009">Exhibit 15.9</a> listed a large percentage of cash inflows in the later years of the project, which contributed to the small positive cash flow anticipated for the project; unfortunately, cash flows several years into the future are more uncertain and unpredictable than those likely to arrive in the near term, so these long-term estimates should be closely reviewed. In short, one should spend a great deal of time questioning the expected cash flows used in a net present value analysis so as to be sure of the outcome.</p><p class="para">Cash flow assumptions are not the only factor involved in the net present value calculation. The other factor is the cost of capital used to discount the stream of cash flows. If this factor is incorrect by even a small amount, then the net present value will be incorrect, which can lead to an incorrect decision regarding the acceptance or rejection of a project. The simplest way to determine the potential severity of an error with the cost of capital is to recalculate the net present value using a cost of capital that is incrementally higher than the original interest rate. If the net present value drops below zero, then it may be necessary to review the accuracy of the cost of capital to ensure that it is correct. A slightly more elaborate approach, as shown in <a id="c15-fig-0010-1" href="#c15-fig-0010">Exhibit 15.10</a>, is to plot a comparison of the net present value to the cost of capital to see at what discount rate the net present value drops to zero. Using this graphical approach, we can see that, if the cost of capital increases by just 1% from the 13% used earlier in <a href="#c15-fig-0009">Exhibit 15.9</a>, the net present value will turn negative. Consequently, though the original calculation shows a positive return, it is so small that a reexamination of the cost of capital may be in order to verify that the discount rate used is the correct one.</p><div class="figure"><p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c15-fig-0010" href="#c15-fig-0010-1">Exhibit 15.10</a></span> NPV to Discount Rate Comparison</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/nc15f010.jpg" alt="nc15f010.eps" width="550" height="372"/></div><p class="para">The calculations used to create the graph in <a href="#c15-fig-0010">Exhibit 15.10</a> are shown at the bottom of the exhibit, with the text of all formulas noted in the lower right corner.

This section only deals with one additional item related to the analysis of a capital asset investment decision.</p><p class="para">A key issue that factors into the cash flow from a project is its depreciation rate. Though depreciation does not directly involve cash flow (since it is only the amortization of the original cash outlay for the capital asset), it has an indirect impact because the depreciation expense in each period will reduce the amount of taxes paid—and that is a real cash outflow. There are a variety of depreciation methods available that Excel can translate into period-by-period depreciation rates that can then be inserted into a cash flow model to derive the ultimate impact on cash flows. The following list illustrates the formulas for each one, and briefly explains how each depreciation method works:</p><ul class="list"><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Double-declining balance depreciation.</span> This method computes depreciation at a highly accelerated rate, generally resulting in the greatest first-period depreciation of all the methods described here. The formula detail is double declining balance (DDB) (cost, salvage, life, period). The cost part of the equation is the initial cost of the asset. The salvage part of the equation is the end-of-project salvage value (if any) of the equipment. The life part of the equation is the number of periods during which the asset is being depreciated, which is assumed to be in years. The period part of the equation is the period for which you want to determine the depreciation rate. For example, if you want to calculate the depreciation for 10 consecutive years, you will need to run the formula 10 times, while changing the period part of the equation each time to reflect the desired year's result.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Fixed-declining balance depreciation.</span> This method also computes depreciation at an accelerated rate. The formula detail is declining balance (DB) (cost, salvage, life, period). The descriptions for all of the inputs to the equation are identical to those for the double-declining balance method.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Straight-line depreciation.</span> This method computes depreciation at the same rate for all periods, resulting in a smooth and easily calculated depreciation amount for all periods. However, it does not assist in accelerating cash flows by aggressively reducing taxes. The formula detail is SLN(cost, salvage, life). The descriptions for all of the inputs to the equation are identical to those for the double-declining balance method. However, there is no period entry, since the result will be the same, irrespective of the specific period for which you are calculating the depreciation.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Sum of the years digits depreciation.</span> This method provides accelerated depreciation, although not as rapidly as provided under the double-declining balance method. The formula detail is SYD(cost, salvage, life, period). Once again, the descriptions for all of the inputs to the equation are identical to those for the double-declining balance method.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Variable-declining balance depreciation.</span> This method is essentially the same as the double-declining balance method, but you can alter the depreciation rate, as well as convert over to straight-line depreciation at the point when accelerated depreciation results in a lower depreciation expense. The formula detail is VDB(cost, salvage, life, start period, end period, depreciation factor, switch to straight line). The descriptions for the first three inputs to the equation are the same as those used for the double-declining balance method. The start period part of the equation specifies the beginning period for which you want to calculate depreciation. The end period part of the equation specifies the ending period for which you want to calculate depreciation. The depreciation factor part of the equation specifies the rate at which depreciation is calculated. For example, entering a 2 results in 200% double-declining depreciation, whereas entering a 1.5 results in 150% depreciation, which is a less rapid form of accelerated depreciation. Finally, the switch to straight line part of the equation allows you to enter TRUE to use declining balance depreciation for all depreciation periods or enter FALSE to have the formula automatically switch to straight-line depreciation at the point when straight-line results in a higher depreciation expense.</li></ul><p class="para">It is evident that the bulk of data inputted into all of these depreciation formulas is nearly identical. Only the underlying formulas will alter the calculated depreciation expense.</p><p class="para">The type of depreciation method used matters a great deal, for the most aggressive one, which depreciates the largest amount in the first few periods, will result in reduced taxes in the near term, which results in increased short-term cash flow. Since increased cash flow now is worth more than cash flow at the end of a project, an aggressive depreciation method will yield greater project cash flows.</p><p class="h1" id="c15-sec1-0009">COMPOUNDING ANALYSIS</p><p class="paraaftertitle">One is sometimes called upon to calculate the result of a variety of payment or receipt scenarios that involve streams of cash flows over multiple periods. In this section, we review several of the most common ones, as well as how to use Excel formulas to create accurate answers for each scenario. They are:</p><ul class="list"><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Future value.</span> If a company is investing money at a consistent rate for a fixed time, one may want to know how much that investment stream will be worth at a specified future date. To determine the future value of such an investment stream, use the FV formula. The details of the formula are FV(interest rate, number of periods, payment amount). The interest rate component is the expected earnings rate on the investment. The number of periods component is the number of periods over which a fixed amount is being invested. The payment amount component is the fixed amount being paid during each period. For example, if a company were to invest $4,000 per period for 128 months at an annual interest rate of 8%, the formula would be FV(8%/12,128,–4000).</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Interest rate on an annuity.</span> If a company is offered a specific set of regular payments (i.e., an annuity), it is useful to determine whether this will result in an adequate rate of return. To determine the interest rate on such an annuity, use the RATE formula. The details of the formula are RATE(number of periods, payment amount, present value of payments). The number of periods component specifies the number of periods over which fixed payments will be made. The payment amount component shows the amount of each payment. The present value of payments component notes the current cash value of the investment for which payments are being made. For example, if an investor wishes to purchase a bond with a current value of $100,000 and will pay for it with monthly payments of $1,500 for 10 years, the formula would be RATE(10,–1500,100000). The resulting interest rate will be on a monthly basis, and must be multiplied by 12 to arrive at an annual interest rate.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Loan payment.</span> One of the most common calculations one makes is the determination of loan payments for a specified amount of borrowing at a set interest rate. This calculation can also be used to verify the same information that has been supplied by the lender. To determine the amount of a loan payment, use the PMT formula. The details of the formula are PMT(interest rate, number of payments, present value of loan). The interest rate component is the interest rate per period, and is assumed not to vary. The number of payments component represents the number of periods over which fixed payments are to be made. The present value of loan component is the original amount of the loan that must now be paid off. For example, to determine the payment amount for a loan of $355,000 at an interest rate of 7%, and which will be paid off in 120 periods (e.g., 10 years), the formula would be PMT(7%/12,120,355000).</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Number of periods.</span> If there is an obligation to pay a set amount with a standard number of periodic payments, it may be necessary to determine how long those payments will last before the obligation to pay has been fulfilled. To determine the number of required payments, use the NPER formula. The details of the formula are NPER(interest rate, payment amount, present value). The interest rate component is the interest rate per period, and is assumed not to vary. The payment amount component is the amount paid per period, and is also assumed not to vary. Finally, the present value component is the current value of the obligation being paid off. For example, to determine the number of payment periods required to pay off an investment of $150,000 at an annual interest rate of 12%, and with periodic payments of $28,134, the formula is NPER(12%,–28134,150000).</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Present value.</span> If a company anticipates receiving a string of payments in future periods, it may be useful to determine their present value, since this information can be used to compare the payment stream to the value of other sources of income to figure out which is more valuable. Such an analysis may result in the sale of whatever investment is resulting in a payment stream that is considered to have a less-than-stellar present value. To determine an investment's present value, use the PV formula. The details of the formula are PV (interest rate, number of payment periods, total payment made per period). The interest rate component is the interest rate per period, and is assumed not to vary. The number of payment periods component is the number of periods during which payments are expected to arrive. The total payment made per period component is the payment made in each period, and is assumed to be the same in every period. For example, to determine the present value of a stream of $10,000 payments at a 6.5% interest rate over 20 years, the formula would be PV(6.5%,20,10000). </li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Principal payment.</span> A company sometimes makes a fixed payment without a clear delineation of what portion is interest and what is principal. This is especially common for capital leases, under which the lessor has no legal obligation to reveal how much of either payment component is being paid. To determine the amount of principal within such a payment, use the PPMT formula. The details of the formula are PPMT(interest rate, period, total number of payment periods, present value). The interest rate component is the interest rate per period. The period component is the specific period for which you want to determine the principal payment. The total number of payment periods component is the number of payment periods for the term of the entire loan. Finally, the present value component is the amount of the loan at the beginning of the transaction. For example, if you want to determine the total principal payment in the seventh year of a 12-year, $50,000 loan that bears a 9% interest rate, the formula would be PPMT(9%,7,12,50000).</li></ul><p class="para">Given the number of available Excel formulas, it is evident that the majority of queries one will receive regarding the time value of money can be answered by a short formula entry in Excel.</p><p class="h1" id="c15-sec1-0010">INVESTMENT ANALYSIS</p><p class="paraaftertitle">Excel contains a large number of formulas that can be used to determine the interest rate on a variety of investments. In this section, we cover the key interest rate formulas, including a brief explanation of each one, the components of each formula, and how the formula is used in an example. The definitions of the components of the various formulas are summarized in a set of definitions at the end of this section. The formulas are:</p><ul class="list"><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Calculate the accrued interest on a security that pays interest at maturity.</span> For this calculation, use the ACCRINTM formula. The details of the formula are ACCRINTM(issue date, maturity date, annual coupon rate, par value). For example, if the issue date is 12/12/12 and the maturity date is 5/15/17 on a 9.5% coupon rate bond with a par value of $1,000, the formula would be ACCRINTM(“12/12/12”,“5/15/17”,9.5%,1000).</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Calculate the accrued interest on a security that pays periodic interest.</span> This formula is used to accrue the amount of interest earned from a stream of regular interest payments from an investment. For this calculation, use the ACCRINT formula. The details of the formula are ACCRINT(issue date, first interest date, settlement date, annual coupon rate, par value, number of payments per year). For example, if the issue date is 3/31/12, the first interest date is 4/15/12, the settlement date is 4/10/12, the annual coupon rate is 11%, the par value is $1,000, and there are four payments per year, then the formula will be ACCRINT(“3/31/12”,“4/15/12”,“4/10/12”,11%,1000,4).</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Calculate the annual yield for a discounted security.</span> If a company purchases a security at a discounted rate (usually because the stated interest rate is lower than the prevailing market rate), one should use the YIELDDISC formula to determine its annual yield. The details of the formula are YIELDDISC(settlement date, maturity date, price per $100 face value, redemption value). For example, if the settlement date is 9/9/12, the maturity date is 12/31/22, the price is $101, and the redemption value is $100, then the formula will be YIELDDISC(“9/9/12”,“12/31/22”,101,100).</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Calculate the yield for a Treasury bill.</span> To calculate this yield, use the TBILLYIELD formula. The details of the formula are TBILLYIELD(settlement date, maturity date, price per $100 face value). For example, if the settlement date is April 13, 2012, the maturity date is June 15, 2019, and the price per $100 face value is $94.30, then the formula will be TBILLYIELD(“4/14/12”,“6/15/19”,94.3).</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Calculate the yield on a security that has a short or long first period.</span> A security that was purchased in between its coupon payment dates will still earn the owner the full amount of the next coupon, even though the security was not held for the full period, which results in a higher than normal interest rate earned for the first period. To calculate the full-term yield with the odd-length first period, use the ODDFYIELD formula. The details of the formula are ODDFYIELD(settlement date, maturity date, issue date, first coupon date, annual coupon rate, price per $100 face value, redemption value, number of payments per year). For example, if the settlement date is May 2, 2012, the maturity date is November 11, 2018, the issue date is June 6, 2010, the first coupon date is July 7, 2012, the interest rate is 8.5%, the price is $98.25, the redemption value is $100, and four coupon payments are made per year, then the formula will be ODDFYIELD(“5/2/12”,“11/11/18”,“6/6/10”,“7/7/12”,8.5%, 98.25,100,4).</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Calculate the yield on a security that has a short or long last period.</span> This is the same type of situation as just described in the preceding scenario, except that we are now selling a security before the next scheduled coupon date. The formula now changes to ODDLYIELD, for which the formula detail is ODDLYIELD(settlement date, maturity date, last coupon date, annual coupon rate, price per $100 face value, redemption value, number of payments per year). To use part of the preceding example, if the settlement date is May 2, 2012, the maturity date is November 11, 2017, the last coupon date is August 11, 2017, the interest rate is 8.5%, the price is $98.25, the redemption value is $100, and four coupon payments are made per year, then the formula will be ODDFYIELD(“5/2/12”,“11/11/17”,“8/11/17”,8.5%,98.25,100,4).</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Calculate the yield on a security that pays interest at maturity.</span> Some securities pay all interest at the redemption date, rather than as regular coupon payments. To calculate the yield on these types of securities, use the YIELDMAT formula. The detail for this formula is YIELDMAT (settlement date, maturity date, issue date, annual coupon rate, price per $100 face value). For example, if the settlement date is February 15, 2012, the maturity date is April 15, 2021, the issue date is October 5, 2011, the interest rate is 8.2%, and the price is $101.125, then the formula will be YIELDMAT(“2/15/12”,“4/15/21”,“10/5/11”,8.2%,101.125).</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Calculate the yield on a security that pays periodic interest.</span> This is the standard formula for a basic bond purchase that has no unusual variations in terms of purchase or sale dates, and for which coupon payments are made in standard amounts and on regularly scheduled dates. For this situation, use the YIELD formula. The detail of the formula is YIELD(settlement date, maturity date, annual coupon rate, price per $100 face value, redemption value, number of payments per year). For example, if the settlement date is January 8, 2012, the maturity date is May 15, 2018, the annual coupon rate is 7.5%, the price is $100.50, the redemption value is $100, and there are two coupon payments per year, then the formula will be YIELD(“1/8/12”,“5/15/18”,7.5%,100.50,100,2).</li></ul><p class="para">Most of the components of the preceding formulas are identical. To keep from repeating the definitions of each component for every formula listed earlier, they are summarized next:</p><ul class="list"><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Annual coupon rate.</span> The listed coupon rate on a security.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">First interest date.</span> The first date on which interest is earned on a security.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Issue date.</span> The date on which a security is issued.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Last coupon date.</span> The last coupon date for a security before its redemption date.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Maturity date.</span> The date on which a security expires.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Number of payments per year.</span> The number of coupon payments per year.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Par value.</span> The listed price on a security.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Price per $100 face value.</span> The actual price paid for a security can be higher or lower than the face value, depending on the discount or premium paid to acquire the stated interest to be paid on the security.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Redemption value.</span> The amount paid at the termination date of the security per $100 of face value.</li><li class="listbulleted"><span class="italic">Settlement date.</span> The date when the security is issued to the buyer.</li></ul><p class="para">The formulas described here should be sufficient for calculating the interest rates or accrued interest for the majority of investment situations for which one will need to calculate interest earnings.</p><p class="h1" id="c15-sec1-0011">RISK ANALYSIS</p><p class="paraaftertitle">When constructing a financial analysis of the likely results of a set of projected cash flows, one must always remember that these cash flows are <span class="italic">projected</span>—they are not facts, and may vary considerably from reality. Given the level of uncertainty involved, it may be useful to determine the spread of possible outcomes. By doing so, one can see if all expected outcomes are grouped tightly about a single estimate, which relates to a low level of risk, or if there is a significant spread of possible outcomes, which greatly increases the risk of meeting the targeted outcome. Excel provides a wide array of statistical tools for determining the level of risk, of which this section describes six that are easy to understand and use.</p><p class="para">The first step when using the following statistical tools is to generate a list of possible outcomes for whatever the analysis may be. For example, if there is a capital project under discussion, try to obtain a number of possible outcomes, either by polling several experts in the company or industry, or by personal knowledge of previous actual outcomes for similar types of projects. Then, the first step in the risk analysis work is to determine the highest, lowest, and median values in the list of possible outcomes. These are shown in <a id="c15-fig-0011-1" href="#c15-fig-0011">Exhibit 15.11</a>, where we have itemized a dozen possible annual cash inflows from a project. All possible variations are noted at the top of the worksheet. Below them are the Excel formulas to find the minimum, maximum, and median values from among the list, alongside a listing of the formulas used. However, these are not very precise measures, and do not give a sufficiently accurate view of the level of risk.</p><div class="figure"><p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c15-fig-0011" href="#c15-fig-0011-1">Exhibit 15.11</a></span> Risk Analysis for a Capital Project</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/nc15f011.jpg" alt="nc15f011.eps" width="550" height="522"/></div><p class="para">To provide us with a more detailed idea of the spread of possible outcomes, we can use the Excel QUARTILE formula to generate the average outcome for the first, second, third, and fourth quartiles of all possible outcomes, which we have also converted into a graph with the Excel Chart Wizard icon. Yet another formula that tells us if there is a lean in the data toward the lower or higher end of the spectrum of possible results is the SKEW formula. This formula determines the presence of skew toward the higher end of the possible outcomes (which is positive skew) or a skew toward the lower end of the outcomes (which is a negative skew). A skew of zero indicates no skew in either direction. Finally, the standard deviation is an extremely useful tool for determining the dispersion of possible outcomes about the median of all outcomes. The larger the standard deviation of the sample, the larger the dispersion about the median, and the greater the degree of risk that the average outcome will not be attained.</p><p class="para">The details of the formulas shown in <a href="#c15-fig-0011">Exhibit 15.11</a> are very simple. All of the formulas reference the range of projected cash inflows, which are noted in cells C5 through C16. The only variation from this pattern is for the quartile formulas, which also require the addition of the quartile number at the end of the formula.</p><p class="para">The analysis shown in <a href="#c15-fig-0011">Exhibit 15.11</a> tells us that the project has an extremely wide range of possible outcomes, with a maximum value that is more than four times higher than the minimum value. The range of possible outcomes has a positive skew of 0.24, which tells us that those people providing the estimates have generally guessed that the actual outcome should be higher than the projected average. Finally, the standard deviation from the mean is $1,808, which is slightly more than a 40% variation from the median. With such a large dispersion of possible outcomes, the underlying data requires a great deal more validation before the project can be approved. Also, given the higher degree of risk, the cost of capital used to discount the cash flows from the project may be set higher, thereby making it more difficult to obtain approval for the project.</p></div><p class="footnoteentry"><span class="superscript"><a id="c15-note-001" href="#c15-note-001-1">*</a></span>This chapter is reprinted with permission from Chapter 14 of Financial Analysis: A Controller's Guide, Second Edition, by Steven M.
