This term is most commonly applied to the gradual write-down of intangible items, such as goodwill or organizational costs.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Asset</span> A resource, recorded through a transaction, that is expected to yield a benefit to a company.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Average inventory</span> The beginning inventory for a period, plus the amount at the end of the period, divided by two. It is most commonly used in situations in which just using the period-end inventory yields highly variable results because of constant and large changes in the inventory level.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Bad debt</span> An account receivable that cannot be collected.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Balance sheet</span> Report that summarizes all assets, liabilities, and equity for a company for a given point in time.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Bill of materials</span> Itemization of the parts and subassemblies required to create a product, frequently including assumed scrap rates that will arise as part of the production process.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Book inventory</span> Amount of money invested in inventory, according to a company's accounting records.

If it is an inventory item, then a reserve is created to reduce the value of the inventory by the estimated amount of obsolescence. If it is a fixed asset, the depreciation method and timing will be set to approximate the rate and amount of obsolescence.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Operating expense</span> Any expense associated with the general, sales, and administrative functions of a business.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Operating income</span> Net income of a business, less the impact of any financial activity, such as interest expense or investment income, as well as taxes and extraordinary items.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Other assets</span> Cluster of accounts that are listed after fixed assets on the balance sheet, and which contain minor assets that cannot be reasonably fit into any of the other main asset categories.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Owners' equity</span> Total of all capital contributions and retained earnings on a business's balance sheet.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Paid-in capital</span> Any payment received from investors for stock that exceeds the par value of the stock.</p><p class="glossarydefinition"><span class="bold">Par value</span> Stated value of a stock, which is recorded in the capital stock account.
