It also addresses a company's ability to remain solvent. Solvency is a key concern in Chapter 4, which describes cash flow measurements. Consequently, the measures in both chapters can be used in combination to form a good overall opinion of a corporation's ability to stay in business.</p><p class="para">The measurements discussed in this chapter are:</p><table class="bodycell" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell">Times Interest Earned<br/>Cash Coverage Ratio<br/>Debt Coverage Ratio<br/>Asset Quality Index<br/>Accruals to Assets Ratio<br/>Times Preferred Dividend Earned</td><td class="bodycell">Debt to Equity Ratio<br/>Funded Capital Ratio<br/>Retained Earnings to Stockholders' Equity<br/>Preferred Stock to Total Stockholders' Equity<br/>Issued Shares to Authorized Shares</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="h1" id="c06-sec1-0001">TIMES INTEREST EARNED</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> An investor or lender should be interested in a company's ability to pay its debts. The times interest earned ratio reveals the amount of excess funding that a company still has available after it has paid off its interest expense. If this ratio is close to one, then the company runs a high risk of defaulting on its debt, whereas any higher ratio shows that it is operating with a comfortable amount of extra cash flow that can cushion it if its business falters.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the average interest expense by the average cash flow. Cash flow is a company's net income, to which all noncash expenses (such as depreciation and amortization) have been added back. This ratio should be run on a monthly basis rather than annually, since short-term changes in the amount of debt carried or cash flow realized can have a sudden and dramatic impact on it. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06001.gif" alt=" " width="162" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Cautious Bankers Corporation (CBC) is investigating the possibility of lending money to the Grasp &amp; Sons Door Handle Corporation (GSR). <a id="c6-tbl-001-1" href="#c6-tbl-001">Table 6.1</a> shows the information CBC has collected for the last few months on GSR's operations.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c6-tbl-001" href="#c6-tbl-001-1">TABLE 6.1</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table06001.gif" alt="" width="561" height="148"/><p class="para">The table reveals that, although GSR's interest expense is dropping, its cash flow is dropping much faster so that the company will soon have difficulty meeting its interest payment obligations. The CBC examiner elects to pass on providing the company with any additional debt.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This ratio assumes that there is no ongoing or balloon principal payment on debt. Any such principal payments can greatly exceed the amount of cash outflow required by interest payments, and so must also be factored into the determination of a company's ability to pay its debt. Though many companies simply roll over expiring debt into new debt instruments, it is not always possible for those in difficult financial situations.</p><p class="h1" id="c06-sec1-0002">CASH COVERAGE RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A key test of whether a company can pay for the interest on its debt is to compare the interest expense to the amount of cash available. It is expressed as a proportion of the cash available to the amount of interest currently due and payable. The ratio should be substantially greater than 1:1.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> To calculate the cash coverage ratio, add all noncash expenses to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and divide by interest expense. Noncash expenses are generally considered to be depreciation and amortization, but could also include accrued expenses. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06002.gif" alt=" " width="362" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The lender to Arbitrage Daily, the hedge fund newsletter, is uncertain if Arbitrage can pay for the interest on its debt burden, which it took on as part of a leveraged buyout by management. The company is generating earnings before interest and taxes of $3,000,000, and it records annual depreciation and amortization of $450,000. Arbitrage is scheduled to pay $3,000,000 in interest charges in the coming year. Based on an extrapolation of these financial results into the next year, the lender calculates the following cash coverage ratio:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06003.gif" alt=" " width="319" height="75"/></p><p class="para">The ratio shows that Arbitrage might barely make its interest payments, but with very little room to spare.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This formula may require a considerable amount of fine-tuning to arrive at a realistic cash coverage ratio. For example, you may need to adjust the numerator for net changes in the reserves for sales allowances, product returns, bad debts, and inventory obsolescence (all of which are noncash items). Also, exclude from the denominator any accrued interest expense, premiums, or discounts; you are only concerned with the amount of interest expense that must be paid to the lender.</p><p class="h1" id="c06-sec1-0003">DEBT COVERAGE RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A key solvency issue is the ability of a company to pay its debts. This can be measured with the debt coverage ratio, which compares reported earnings to the amount of scheduled after-tax interest and principal payments to determine whether there is enough income available to cover the payments. If the ratio is less than one, it indicates that a company will probably be unable to make its debt payments. The measure is of particular interest to lenders, who are concerned about a company's ability to repay them for issued loans.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the scheduled amount of principal payments by the inverse of the corporate tax rate. This yields the amount of after-tax income required by a company to pay back the principal. Then add the interest expense to be paid, and divide the sum into the net amount of earnings before interest and taxes. An alternative treatment of the numerator is to use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, because this yields a closer approximation of available cash flow. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06004.gif" alt=" " width="264" height="62"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Egyptian Antiques Company's controller wants to be sure that earnings will be sufficient to pay upcoming debt requirements before implementing the owner's suggested round of Christmas bonuses. The expected operating income for the year, before bonuses, is $135,000. The interest expense is expected to be $18,500. The tax rate is 34%. Upcoming principal payments will be $59,000. The controller uses the following debt coverage calculation to determine whether Christmas bonuses can still be paid:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06005.gif" alt=" " width="335" height="214"/></p><p class="para">The ratio indicates that extra funds will be available for Christmas bonuses since operating income exceeds the amount of scheduled debt payments.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The primary difficulty with this measurement is that it is focused strictly in the near term. It is usually derived from information contained within the financial statements, which report earnings on an historical basis, but gives no view of expected earnings levels, which may be considerably different. Consequently, it is best to accompany this measurement with another one that includes budgeted earnings levels for the next few earnings periods, which gives better insight into a company's ability to pay its debts.</p><p class="h1" id="c06-sec1-0004">ASSET QUALITY INDEX</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The asset quality index is an excellent measurement for locating companies that are capitalizing an increasing proportion of their costs over time, which can be a sign of changes in accounting methods that are designed to show a higher level of profitability than is really the case. Capitalization of costs most obviously occurs in the fixed assets area of the balance sheet but can also be found in the accounts receivable and inventory areas, by means such as overloading of allocated overhead costs and reducing reserves for bad debt or obsolete inventory. A measurement result of one is normal, while anything substantially below that figure is indicative of either financial distress or a push to increase the level of reported earnings above their rightful level.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Add together the current assets and net fixed assets in period two, divide them by total assets in the same period, and subtract the result from one. Then run the same calculation for period one, and divide the result for period one into the result for period two. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06006.gif" alt=" " width="410" height="91"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Glass Lamination International, a publicly held maker of rear-view mirrors for cars, appears to be having difficulty achieving its profit estimates. An investment analyst chooses to use the asset quality index to determine whether there is evidence that the company is shifting expenses into its fixed assets to help it bolster its reported earnings. The relevant information is shown in <a id="c6-tbl-002-1" href="#c6-tbl-002">Table 6.2</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c6-tbl-002" href="#c6-tbl-002-1">TABLE 6.2</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell"></td><td class="headercell">Period One</td><td class="headercell">Period Two</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Current assets</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,275,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,350,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Net fixed assets</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$6,300,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$7,700,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total assets</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$10,575,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$11,050,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The analyst plugs this information into the following asset quality index measurement:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06007.gif" alt=" " width="522" height="412"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The measurement can yield incorrect results if a company has switched from the use of operating leases to capital leases, since this change in financing will shift assets onto the balance sheet that were already in use but which were previously owned by a lessor. For example, a manager may choose to swap out a copier that was used under an operating lease for one that the company owns under a capital lease; the nature of the asset has not changed, but the owner has, so the amount of fixed assets on the company's books will increase.</p><p class="para">The measurement can also be altered by a change in the capitalization limit. For example, the company controller may request an increase in the capitalization limit from $1,000 to $2,000 so that the accounting staff will not have so great an asset-tracking burden. By doing so, the company records fewer fixed assets, even though its spending habits have not changed at all.</p><p class="para">The measurement can also be altered by changes in the depreciation calculation for fixed assets because the measurement records fixed assets net of depreciation. For example, if a company were to lengthen the period over which it depreciates assets, increase their assumed salvage values, or switch from accelerated to straight-line depreciation, the result would be less overall depreciation being charged against assets and an increase in the proportion of assets in later periods, assuming that assets continue to be purchased at a steady pace.</p><p class="h1" id="c06-sec1-0005">ACCRUALS TO ASSETS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A key solvency issue for an outside investigator, such as an investor, lender, or investment analyst, is the presence of any changes in accruals over time that might be evidence of accounting tampering for the purpose of modifying a company's reported financial results. The accruals to assets ratio can be used on a trend line to show if the proportion of accruals (a key source of possible accounting modifications) to assets is varying over time. If the proportion of accruals to assets is increasing, accounting tampering may be covering a solvency issue or at least pumping up reported earnings beyond their actual level.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Calculate the change in working capital from a predetermined earlier reporting period. Then subtract from this amount the net change in cash and depreciation over the same period. Then divide the remainder by the change in total assets. There should be no excessive usage of accruals if the ratio results in the same figure over several periods, whereas it may indicate more aggressive accounting practices if the ratio increases over time. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06008.gif" alt=" " width="446" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> An investment analyst is concerned about the reported performance of an international grain brokerage company whose financial statements are famous for their byzantine workings, vague footnotes, and general lack of understandability. The analyst suspects that the company is hiding weak financial results within this obfuscation. The balance sheet information for the company for two successive years is shown in <a id="c6-tbl-003-1" href="#c6-tbl-003">Table 6.3</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c6-tbl-003" href="#c6-tbl-003-1">TABLE 6.3</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table06003.gif" alt="" width="559" height="107"/><p class="para">Using this information, the analyst calculates the accruals to assets ratio with the following formula:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06009.gif" alt=" " width="460" height="158"/></p><p class="para">The analyst notes that the accruals to assets ratio of 94% is higher than the 75% figure that was calculated for it in the preceding year, indicating that working capital appears to be rising faster than assets as a whole. The analyst investigates further by calculating the days of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable on hand, and finds that the days of inventory has increased dramatically over the past few years. Yet another level of detailed research leads to the conclusion that the company has altered its inventory costing system to help it capitalize more overhead costs into inventory, thereby increasing the reported level of earnings. The accruals to assets ratio was the first clue that something was amiss.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measurement calculates the level of accruals that a company is using by assuming that the proportions of the various balance sheet line items to total assets will remain the same from year to year, and that only accruals will be the cause of any differences. This assumption can be significantly incorrect if the underlying nature of the business has changed in the interim, or if changes in management practices have resulted in significant changes in operational capabilities. For example, if the management team has elected to ease credit restrictions on new customers in order to increase sales, then the proportion of accounts receivable to total assets will very likely increase because of the addition of lower-credit customers. This increase in accounts receivable is not related in any way to an increase in accruals in the accounts receivable account. These types of changes can consequently make the accruals to assets ratio look substantially better or worse than it really is. To avoid this problem, use the measure as a general indicator of possible problems, and then conduct more in-depth analyses for individual accounts to determine where there may be actual changes in the proportions of accruals used.</p><p class="h1" id="c06-sec1-0006">TIMES PREFERRED DIVIDEND EARNED</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The owner of a company's preferred shares will have a considerable degree of interest in the company's ability to spin off enough cash flow to pay for any preferred dividends. This is also of interest to common shareholders, since they are usually not paid until the preferred shareholder dividends have been paid out. This is of particular interest to both parties when the amount of the preferred dividend is locked in by the preferred stock agreement rather than being a variable amount that is approved by the board of directors.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the current amount of the preferred dividend due for payment into net income. The resulting number yields a high degree of confidence in a company's ability to pay the dividend if it is substantially greater than one. A variation on the calculation is to use the cumulative amount of preferred dividends due rather than the current amount, since some dividends may not have been paid in previous periods. Another variation is to use net cash flow in the numerator, rather than the reported amount of net income, since this strips away any noncash expense or revenue factors that may be included in the net income figure. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06010.gif" alt=" " width="122" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Series A preferred shareholders of the Klaxon Fire Alarm Company have not been paid their 8% dividends for the past three years and are beginning to wonder if they will ever be paid. Under their shareholder agreement, they have the authority to force the sale of the company if preferred stock dividends are not paid in a timely manner. They want to know if this is the year in which they either force through the dividend payment or sell the company. In the current year, the company has earned $210,000. The number of preferred shares outstanding has been 48,000 for the past three years, and all shares were sold to the company for $18. To determine whether the payment can be made, they calculate the times preferred dividend earned measurement as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06011.gif" alt=" " width="481" height="182"/></p><p class="para">The measurement indicates that the company can just barely pay for the entire amount of current dividends and dividends in arrears.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The preferred stock dividend can be avoided under many preferred stock agreements; however, if it is not paid, it becomes cumulative and must be paid at some specific future date or, more commonly, before the distribution of dividends to common shareholders. In either case, because of the cumulative payout feature, a shareholder does not need to be concerned if this ratio does not reveal that a company can pay the dividend in the short term.</p><p class="para">Also, the formula does not account for a company's prospective cash flow needs in the near term, such as capital expenditures, that may keep it from paying the dividend.</p><p class="h1" id="c06-sec1-0007">DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio is one of the most closely watched by creditors and investors, because it reveals the extent to which company management is willing to fund its operations with debt rather than equity. For example, a company that wants to increase its return on equity can do so by obtaining debt, which it then uses to buy back stock, thereby shrinking the amount of equity that is used to calculate the return on equity. This strategy works for as long as the after-tax interest cost of the debt does not exceed the benefit of the increased earnings per share resulting from the reduction in shares.</p><p class="para">Lenders are particularly concerned about this ratio, since an excessively high ratio of debt to equity will put their loans at risk of not being repaid. Possible requirements by lenders to counteract this problem are the use of restrictive covenants that force excess cash flow into debt repayment, restrictions on alternative uses of cash, and a requirement for investors to put more equity into the company.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide total debt by total equity. For a true picture of the amount of debt that a company has obtained, the debt figure should include all operating and capital lease payments. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06012.gif" alt=" " width="44" height="40"/></p><p class="para">A more restrictive view of the formula is to include only long-term debt in the numerator, on the assumption that this variation gives a better picture of a company's long-term debt to equity structure. However, this view excludes situations in which short-term debt, such as revolving credit lines, cannot be paid off in the short term and must eventually be converted into long-term debt, thereby increasing the overall amount of long-term debt.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Conemaugh Cell Phone Company has piled up a great deal of debt while purchasing new bandwidth from the federal government in the key St. Louis marketplace. Its existing debt covenants already stipulate that the company cannot exceed a debt to equity ratio of 1½ to 1. Its latest prospective purchase of a rival company, Grand Lake Wireless, will cost $55,000,000. Given its existing equity level of $182,000,000 and outstanding debt of $243,000,000, will it exceed the covenanted debt to equity ratio? To answer this question, the following formula is used:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06013.gif" alt=" " width="421" height="181"/></p><p class="para">The debt to equity ratio resulting from the proposed deal will exceed the covenant, so Conemaugh must either renegotiate the covenant or complete the acquisition with a mix of debt and equity that will not violate the covenant.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Consider calculating the debt to equity ratio for several years into the future, focusing on the relationship between interest and principal payments (rather than total debt) and equity for each year. The reason for this approach is that a large amount of total debt on the balance sheet may not reveal a true picture of a company's ability to pay it off if the debt is not due for payment until a required balloon payment at some point well into the future. However, a much smaller amount of debt on the balance sheet may be completely unsupportable if the bulk of it is due for payment in the near term.</p><p class="h1" id="c06-sec1-0008">FUNDED CAPITAL RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio shows the proportion of fixed assets that are being funded by long-term funding, which is defined as long-term debt and stockholders' equity. If the ratio results in a figure substantially less than 100%, then one can assume that the company is being forced to use presumably higher-cost short-term debt to finance its base of long-term assets. At some point in the future, this could give rise to a dangerous situation in which the company could refinance its short-term debt at only very high interest rates or would be unable to refinance at all, possibly resulting in either corporate liquidation or the sale of assets.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide stockholders' equity and long-term debt by fixed assets. If generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are properly applied to the recording of capital leases, the debt associated with these leases that is not due for payment within one year will already be recorded as long-term debt. The fixed asset figure is typically recorded net of depreciation expense, on the grounds that the depreciation is approximately representative of the decline in market value of the related fixed assets over time. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06014.gif" alt=" " width="250" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Manila Rope Company has operated on a shoestring for a number of years, having financed its rope-making equipment with short-term loans from relatives and credit card providers. Its newly hired CFO wants to determine its funded capital ratio to determine if there is an excessive degree of short-term financing that can be replaced with more stable long-term debt. The company's stockholders' equity is $128,000, its long-term debt is $30,000, and it has $311,000 in net fixed assets. The calculation is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06015.gif" alt=" " width="391" height="116"/></p><p class="para">The funded capital ratio is an anemic 51% and is sufficient evidence that longer-term financing is required. The CFO promptly arranges 10-year capital leases for the existing rope-making equipment.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The net amount of fixed assets recorded on the company books may vary considerably from their actual value if the depreciation method, assumed salvage value, and expected life of the underlying assets result in depreciation that does not match their actual market value. To avoid this problem, use a periodic appraisal of the market value of the fixed assets, and use this amount in the denominator. However, appraisals can be expensive and will not necessarily result in accurate asset resale values.</p><p class="h1" id="c06-sec1-0009">RETAINED EARNINGS TO STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio is used by lenders and investment analysts to determine if a company is retaining earnings in the business or if they have a penchant for distributing it to the owners. If the latter situation is the case, then company managers are probably funding activities through the use of debt, which raises the level of risk to the lenders if there is a substantial amount of debt. This ratio is particularly applicable in situations where company ownership is closely held, since the small number of owners can vote themselves dividends out of retained earnings.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide retained earnings by total stockholders' equity. If the accounting staff has shifted retained earnings into a reserve for dividends payable, then this reserve should <span class="italic">not</span> be included in the formula, since the intent is to distribute it. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06016.gif" alt=" " width="168" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Teacher Equipment Company, which mates various extension housings to truck bodies for utility companies, is owned by a few family members. These owners regularly distribute the bulk of all earnings to themselves. The company is interested in expanding its business by purchasing a similar company in a different city, and appeals to a bank for a $5,000,000 loan. The investigating lender accumulates the information in <a id="c6-tbl-004-1" href="#c6-tbl-004">Table 6.4</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c6-tbl-004" href="#c6-tbl-004-1">TABLE 6.4</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Net income from operations</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$720,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Retained earnings</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$35,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total stockholders' equity</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$225,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The lender finds that the retained earnings to stockholders' equity ratio is only 15.6%, which is derived as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06017.gif" alt=" " width="235" height="41"/></p><p class="para">The ratio shows that the family is extracting a great deal of money from the business every year. However, the business also generates a large $720,000 profit, so it is theoretically capable of paying back the loan. Further questions that the lending officer needs to resolve are whether the company has a multiyear history of creating these large profits, and whether the family members will accept a lower distribution from earnings for a few years to pay off the loan in case the acquisition does not generate more cash flow.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The reason why retained earnings may also be low in relation to total stockholders' equity is that the company has never had any earnings to place in the account, which would also lead a lender to decline issuing a loan to this type of company. However, it is also possible that the Internal Revenue Service has required a retained earnings dividend to investors on the grounds that the company is retaining more earnings than it needs to run the business. In the latter case, a low retained earnings level is not the company's fault and should not keep a lender from extending funds to it.</p><p class="h1" id="c06-sec1-0010">PREFERRED STOCK TO TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A common stockholder does not want to see a high proportion of preferred stock to stockholders' equity, because preferred shares are frequently issued with a number of payment and liquidation preferences that can result in very little equity being left over for the common shareholders. For example, a preferred stock agreement may give an investor a dividend, as well as a guaranteed payback of the original investment (or more) in the event of a liquidation, plus control over any acquisitions or divestitures. Consequently, a high ratio of preferred stock to stockholders' equity can scare away likely common stock investors.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide total preferred stock by total stockholder's equity. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06018.gif" alt=" " width="133" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The DbIndex Consulting firm is a Washington, DC–based company that specializes in security consulting for large government database projects. It has run into serious cash flow difficulties because of a delay in the approval of the federal budget, and so it has sold Series A preferred shares to an outside investor in exchange for $600,000 in cash. The total amount of stockholders' equity before the transaction is $1,350,000. The ratio of preferred stock to stockholders' equity is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06019.gif" alt=" " width="409" height="113"/></p><p class="para">Though the ratio reveals that the preferred shareholder owns a minority position in the company, the president of DbIndex Consulting does not realize until later, when the president tries to sell the company, that the investor, according to the preferred stock agreement, must vote in favor of any such decision. The president ends up having to cede many extra common shares to the investor just to obtain the investor's agreement to the sale transaction. In short, the measurement alone did not tell the whole story of how the preferred stock sale affected the other shareholders in the business.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This ratio by itself is not sufficient evidence of control by preferred shareholders. A potential common stock investor should obtain the preferred stock agreement and peruse it to see what special privileges have been guaranteed to the preferred shareholders in order to have an accurate idea of the payment and liquidation preferences that have been signed over to them. Footnotes to the financial statements contain much of this information, but reading the underlying legal document is best.</p><p class="h1" id="c06-sec1-0011">ISSUED SHARES TO AUTHORIZED SHARES</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The ratio of issued to authorized shares tells the CFO if it is necessary to go to the board of directors to ask for an additional authorization of shares. This request usually comes up when the number of issued shares is approaching the total amount authorized, and there is an additional need to issue shares for a variety of reasons, for example, additional option grants are contemplated, shares are needed to pay for acquisitions, or more funding is needed from equity investors.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total number of issued shares by the total number of authorized shares. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06020.gif" alt=" " width="155" height="37"/></p><p class="para">A variation on the formula is to combine the number of issued shares with the number of stock options, warrants, and convertible securities, and then divide this amount by the total number of authorized shares. This gives a better feel for the number of shares that will be available if all of these stock rights are converted into shares. The formula can be fine-tuned by including only those stock rights that are currently vested, in the money, or both, since these rights are the ones most likely to be converted into shares. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06021.gif" alt=" " width="467" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The CFO of the Prudent Insurance Company is conservative and wants to be certain that there are enough authorized shares available to meet all possible financing needs. According to the footnotes in the financial statements, the company faces the equity-related issues shown in <a id="c6-tbl-005-1" href="#c6-tbl-005">Table 6.5</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c6-tbl-005" href="#c6-tbl-005-1">TABLE 6.5</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell"></td><td class="headercell">Quantity</td><td class="headercell">Converted to Shares</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Number of authorized shares</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">28,000,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">28,000,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Number of issued shares</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">23,524,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">23,524,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Number of stock warrants outstanding</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">125,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">125,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Number of convertible securities outstanding (conversion ratio of one bond to eight shares)</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">310,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2,480,000 </td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Number of stock options outstanding</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1,805,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1,805,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">Also, the CFO expects to need an additional $98,000,000 of equity funding, which should sell for about $28 per share. By using the expanded form of the issued shares to authorized shares ratio, the CFO arrives at this result before the planned sale of additional equity:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu06022.gif" alt=" " width="482" height="167"/></p><p class="para">The ratio shows that there are just barely enough authorized shares on hand to cover all possible demands on the number of authorized shares. If the CFO chooses to pursue the sale of new equity, however, the board will have to be petitioned for the authorization of additional shares. The new equity offering would require 3,500,000 additional shares ($98,000,000 of total equity divided by $28 per share), which would increase the ratio to 112%. If most of the options, warrants, and convertible securities are unlikely to be converted into shares in the short term, however, this would leave enough room to sell existing authorized shares in the new equity offering without the addition of more shares.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Good judgment is required when using the expanded form of this measurement, because some or all of the existing options, warrants, and convertible securities may never be converted into shares, depending on whether options are vested or if any of the various categories of near-stock are in the money, so investors will have an incentive to purchase the stock. If many options are currently not vested, then it may make sense to run the calculation for both the current date and the future date when the options will become vested to see how the timing would affect the issued to authorized shares ratio. The determination of when near-stock will be in the money at some future date is much more difficult to predict, so it is generally best to calculate the ratio based on low-medium-high predictions of conversions to stock to determine whether there are any scenarios in which the number of shares authorized would not be sufficient.</p><p class="para">All of these issues are avoided in those cases in which company bylaws expressly disallow company management from issuing near-stock whose potential conversion into stock would exceed the amount of authorized stock.</p></div></div>
