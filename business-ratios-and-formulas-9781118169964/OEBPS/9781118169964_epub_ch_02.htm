There are several that require additional information from the balance sheet, as well as internal information, such as employee headcount, that may not be readily discernible from published financial statements. The general intent of the analysis tools presented here is to show a company's ability to sustain its sales, the level of asset and expense usage required to do so, and the sustainability of its current sales and expense levels. There are also specialized ratios that deal with such issues as sales returns, repairs and maintenance, fringe benefits, interest expense, and overhead rates.</p><p class="para">Each of the following sections describes the uses of a ratio or formula, explains the proper method of calculation, and gives an example. Each section also discusses how each ratio or formula can be misused, skewed, or incorrectly applied.</p><p class="para">The ratios and formulas presented in this chapter are:</p><table class="bodytable" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sales to Working Capital Ratio<br/>Sales to Fixed Assets Ratio<br/>Sales to Administrative Expenses Ratio<br/>Sales to Equity Ratio<br/>Sales per Person<br/>Sales Backlog Ratio<br/>Sales Returns to Gross Sales Ratio<br/>Repairs and Maintenance Expense to Fixed Assets Ratio<br/>Accumulated Depreciation to Fixed Assets Ratio<br/>Capital to Labor Ratio</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Fringe Benefits to Wages and Salaries Expense<br/>Sales Expenses to Sales Ratio<br/>Discretionary Cost Ratio<br/>Interest Expense to Debt Ratio<br/>Foreign Exchange Ratios<br/>Overhead Rate<br/>Goodwill to Assets Ratio<br/>Overhead to Cost of Sales Ratio<br/>Investment Turnover<br/>Break-Even Point<br/>Margin of Safety<br/>Tax Rate Percentage</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0001">SALES TO WORKING CAPITAL RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> It is exceedingly important to keep the amount of cash used by an organization at a minimum, so that its financing needs are reduced. One of the best ways to determine changes in the overall use of cash over time is the ratio of sales to working capital. This ratio shows the amount of cash required to maintain a certain level of sales. It is most effective when tracked on a trend line, so that management can see if there is a long-term change in the amount of cash required by the business for it to generate the same amount of sales. For instance, if a company has elected to increase its sales to less creditworthy customers, it is likely that they will pay more slowly than regular customers, thereby increasing the company's investment in accounts receivable. Similarly, if the management team decides to increase the speed of order fulfillment by increasing the amount of inventory for certain items, then the inventory investment will increase. In both cases, the ratio of working capital to sales will worsen because of specific management decisions. This ratio is also used for budgeting purposes, since budgeted working capital levels can be compared to the historical amount of this ratio to see if the budgeted working capital level is sufficient.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Annualized net sales are compared to working capital, which is accounts receivable, plus inventory, minus accounts payable. One should not use annualized gross sales in the calculation, since this would include in the sales figure the amount of any sales that have already been returned and are therefore already included in the inventory figure. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02001.gif" alt=" " width="342" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Jolt Power Supply Company has elected to reduce the amount of inventory it carries for some of its least-ordered stock items, with the goal of increasing inventory turnover from twice a year to four times a year. It achieves its inventory goal rapidly by selling back some of its inventory to its suppliers in exchange for credits against future purchases. Portions of its operating results for the first four quarters after this decision was made are shown in <a id="c2-tbl-001-1" href="#c2-tbl-001">Table 2.1</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c2-tbl-001" href="#c2-tbl-001-1">TABLE 2.1</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/tableu02001.gif" alt=" " width="554" height="144"/></p><p class="para">The ratio calculation at the end of each quarter is for annualized sales, so we multiply each quarterly sales figure by 4 to arrive at estimated annual sales. The accounts receivable turn over at a rate of once every 30 days, which does not change through the term of the analysis. Inventory drops in the second quarter to arrive at the new inventory turnover goal, while the amount of accounts payable stays at one-half of the revenue level, reflecting a typical distributor's gross margin of 50% throughout all four periods. The resulting ratio shows that the company has indeed improved its ratio of working capital to sales, but at the price of some lost sales to customers who were apparently coming to the company because of its broad inventory selection. </p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As stated in <a href="#c2-tbl-001">Table 2.1</a>, using this ratio to manage a business can yield unforeseen results, such as a drop in sales because of reduced inventory levels or tighter customer credit controls. Also, arbitrarily lengthening the terms of accounts payable for the purpose of reducing the working capital investment will likely lead to strained supplier relations, which may eventually result in increased supplier prices or the use of different and less reliable suppliers.</p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0002">SALES TO FIXED ASSETS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> In some industries, a key barrier to entry is the large amount of assets required to produce revenues. For example, the oil-refining business requires the construction of a complete refining facility before any sales can be generated. By using the sales to fixed assets ratio, one can see if a company is investing a great deal of money in assets in order to generate sales. This is a particularly effective measure when compared to the same ratio for other companies in the same industry; that is, if another company has found a way to generate profitable sales with a smaller asset investment, then it will be rewarded with a higher valuation. This measure is also useful when tracked on a trend line, so that one can see if there are any sudden jumps in asset investments that the company has made to incrementally bring in more sales. For example, a printing facility may have achieved 100% utilization of its printing plant, and so cannot generate more sales without a multimillion-dollar investment in new equipment. In such cases, the key question is whether there is a reasonable expectation of generating a sufficient incremental increase in revenues to justify the additional investment.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide net sales for a full year by the total amount of fixed assets. There are several variations on this formula. One is to calculate annualized net sales on a rolling basis, so that the last 12 months of revenue are always used. This can be a better approach than attempting to extrapolate revenues forward for several months, especially if future revenues are uncertain. The denominator in the calculation, which is the amount of total fixed assets, may be used net of depreciation or before depreciation; the most common usage is after depreciation, since this is more indicative of the actual value of the assets. However, if accelerated depreciation is used, there may be little relationship between the amount of depreciation recognized and the value of the fixed assets, which may lead one to use total fixed assets before accumulated depreciation. Both variations on the formula are shown here:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02002.gif" alt=" " width="330" height="91"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Turtle Tank Company creates tracked vehicles for a number of military organizations. It has recently received an order from the country of Montrachet for annual delivery of 20 tanks per year for the next eight years. The trouble with this order is that the company's existing capacity can handle only 10 more tanks per year. An entire additional production line must be created for it to manufacture the extra tanks, which will require an increase in fixed assets of $20 million. The price the company will receive for each tank is $850,000. It currently produces 70 tanks per year, and has fixed assets of $40 million. Based on these numbers, its net sales to fixed assets ratio will change, as shown in <a id="c2-tbl-002-1" href="#c2-tbl-002">Table 2.2</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c2-tbl-002" href="#c2-tbl-002-1">TABLE 2.2</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">If No Change</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">If Invest in New Line</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Annual sales</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$68,000,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$76,500,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total fixed assets</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$40,000,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$60,000,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sales to fixed assets ratio</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1.7:1</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1.3:1</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The Turtle Tank Company is a publicly held company, so its management is concerned that the much lower ratio that would be caused by the new investment would not compare favorably to the same ratio for its competitors. This might cause investors to think that the company is poorly managed, resulting in a sell-off of its stock. An alternative solution for the situation is for the managers to ignore the short-term impact of the ratio and instead to focus on the key issue, which is whether there will be enough additional business in the future to justify the additional investment.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The sales to fixed assets ratio should not be used at a consolidated level for companies that include many types of businesses, since it is quite possible that only a few businesses within the entity are asset-intensive. For this reason, it is better to calculate the measure for individual businesses or product lines. The ratio can also be misleading if a company does not have sufficient funds to purchase new assets, in which case it may appear to have a small asset base due to the large amount of offsetting depreciation expense that has accumulated over time.</p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0003">SALES TO ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A key issue is how much overhead expense is needed to maintain a certain level of sales volume. For example, a company with a strategy of selling very small orders to its customers requires a large accounting department, not only to issue a vast quantity of invoices, but also to process a large number of payments. Similarly, if a company has a large proportion of employees to the amount of revenue generated (such as a restaurant chain), then the human resources staff will be correspondingly large. In these cases, it is important to ensure that the administrative expense is carefully controlled so that it does not have an excessively large impact on profits.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide annualized net sales by the total of all general and administrative expenses. It is better to use the last 12 months of net sales for the annualized net sales figure, rather than an estimate of sales for future months, since the look-forward estimate may be substantially incorrect. Also, the expense figure in the denominator should include the cost of the sales department, especially if its cost is largely fixed (as is the case when the sales staff has a high proportion of salaries to commissions). The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02003.gif" alt=" " width="270" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Windy Weather Gauge Company has experienced a sharp drop in sales volume. Its ratio of sales to general and administrative expenses has changed from 1:0.1 to 1:0.2, indicating that this cluster of expenses has doubled in proportion to overall sales. This relative expense increase will certainly have a major negative impact on profits. The controller needs to see if it is possible to drop these expenses back to their previous proportion to sales. Finding that the primary expense in this area is salaries, the controller quickly determines that there are so few personnel in each of the administrative areas that only outsourcing or the merging of departments will allow the company to achieve its previous sales to administrative expenses ratio. Accordingly, the human resources work is taken on by the controller, computer systems development is curtailed, and the accounting department combines its accounts payable and receivable staff into a single group. Thus, quick action based on this ratio allows the company to shrink its administrative expenses down to a level that will ensure continuing profits.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This ratio can be used as the justification for a reduction or freeze in the amount of general and administrative expenses, on the grounds that the proportion of expenses to sales in the past should be the same in the future. However, if there is a significant change in sales volume, this is a less clear relationship. For example, if sales volume doubles, it is quite possible that the general and administrative expense does not have to double as well, since much of the existing infrastructure may be able to handle the additional growth. Conversely, a significant drop in sales volume may still require a company to leave much of its general and administrative expenses in place because of long-term contracts that cannot be voided (such as building leases) or the presence of significant fixed assets (such as computer centers) that cannot be reduced to reflect the smaller sales volume. Consequently, changes to general and administrative expenses may be indicated by this ratio, but in-depth analysis must be done to determine if a change is really possible.</p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0004">SALES TO EQUITY RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio is used to determine the amount of equity that should be retained within a business as sales volumes fluctuate. For example, if sales growth increases rapidly, it is likely that a considerable additional amount of working capital will be required to sustain this higher level of sales growth. If so, the required cash can come from debt, internal cash generation, or equity. The ratio can also be used to determine if too much equity has accumulated in a business, so that some may be extracted through extra dividends, a stock buyback, or some other form of distribution.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide annual net sales by total equity. It is important to include retained earnings in the denominator; many companies that have high margins or have been generating profits for many years have accumulated a great deal of retained earnings, which may make up the largest component of equity. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02004.gif" alt=" " width="111" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> An examiner for the Friendly Tax Collection Service calls on a company that has paid out no dividends for the past few years. An examination of the company's accounting records reveals the information shown in <a id="c2-tbl-003-1" href="#c2-tbl-003">Table 2.3</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c2-tbl-003" href="#c2-tbl-003-1">TABLE 2.3</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/tableu02003.gif" alt=" " width="555" height="141"/></p><p class="para">This table reveals that the company is extremely profitable, with over a million dollars being added to retained earnings in every year. The company does not appear to be using these funds, since the amount of incremental investment in fixed assets is minuscule. The sales to equity ratio shows that the amount of equity in the business is continuing to rise in relation to sales. Consequently, the auditor can make a good case that the company should be distributing more of its equity as dividends; being taxable, these dividends will increase the taxes collected by the Friendly Tax Collection Service.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> If a company is already highly leveraged, the amount of equity is so small that the sales to equity ratio has no particular relevance. Also, a decision to shift away from debt to more equity, or vice versa, will have a significant impact on this ratio even if there is no change in the sales level. A company's financing decisions consequently have a great deal of influence over this ratio.</p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0005">SALES PER PERSON</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This is one of the most closely watched of all performance measures. It is based on the assumption that employees are at the core of a company's profitability, and so high degrees of efficiency in this area are bound to result in strong profitability. It is also a standard benchmark in many industries.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide revenue for a full year by the total number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) in the company. An FTE is the combination of staffing that equals a 40-hour week. For example, two half-time employees would be counted as one FTE. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02005.gif" alt=" " width="169" height="78"/></p><p class="para">A variation on this ratio is to divide annual revenues by only those FTEs that can be categorized as direct labor. This measures the productivity of those personnel who are directly connected to the manufacture of a company's products or services. This measure should be used with care, since it is not always easy to determine which employees can be categorized as direct labor and which ones fall into the overhead category instead. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02006.gif" alt=" " width="246" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The operations manager of the Twirling Washing Machine Company wants to determine the sales per person for the company, both for all staff and just the direct labor personnel. The company has annual revenues of $4.2 million. Its headcount is as follows:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top">Department</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Headcount</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Direct labor department</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">22</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Direct labor part-time staff</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">6</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Production supervisors</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Materials-handling department</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">4</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sales, general and administrative</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">10</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Administrative part-time staff</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Engineering department</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">8</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The company has 54 employees. However, if the part-time staff all work half-time, then the eight part-time positions can be reduced to four FTEs, which decreases the total headcount to 50 personnel. Another issue is what constitutes direct labor personnel—the company has a group of clearly defined direct labor personnel, as well as a materials-handling support staff and two production supervisors. The company can use any combination of these groups for its sales per direct labor measurement as long as it consistently applies the measurement over time. The technically correct approach, however, is to include in the measure any positions that are required for the proper completion of production efforts, which would require the inclusion of all three categories of labor. If this approach were not used, the person doing the measuring might be tempted to artificially inflate the measurement results by shifting direct labor personnel into other labor categories that fall just outside the definition.</p><p class="para">The result of these measurements is overall sales per employee of $84,000 (which is $4,200,000 in revenues, divided by 50 employees) and sales per direct labor employee of $135,484 (which is $4,200,000 in revenues, divided by 31 employees). The employee figure of 31 was derived by adding 22 direct labor personnel to the three FTEs represented by the six part-time direct labor personnel, plus the production supervisors and materials-handling staff.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This formula is subject to a high degree of variation, depending on how personnel are counted. For example, shifting away from employees to an outsourced solution or to the in-house use of temporary employees can artificially reduce the number of FTEs, as can the use of overtime by a smaller number of employees. Also, comparing the number of FTEs to revenue has less direct bearing on profitability than comparing revenues to the total of all salaries and wages expenses; for example, one company with a large headcount but low pay per person may be more profitable than a company having a lower headcount but a much higher salary per person. Also, some capital-intensive industries have so few employees in relation to the sales volume generated that this measure has much less significance than other measures, such as sales to fixed assets.</p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0006">SALES BACKLOG RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The sales backlog ratio cannot be determined strictly from any standard financial statements, since the backlog is normally included only in internal management reports. Nonetheless, if the backlog information is available, this ratio should be an extremely useful tool for determining a company's ability to maintain its current level of production. If the ratio is dropping rapidly over several consecutive months, then it is likely that the company will soon experience a reduction in sales volume as well as over-capacity in its production and related overhead areas, resulting in imminent losses. Conversely, a rapid jump in the ratio indicates that a company cannot keep up with demand, and it may soon have customer relations problems from delayed orders and need additional capital expenditures and staff hirings to increase its productive capacity.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the most current total backlog of sales orders by sales. It is generally best not to use annualized sales in the denominator, since sales may vary considerably over that period, due to the influence of seasonality. A better denominator is sales over just the preceding quarter. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02007.gif" alt=" " width="170" height="34"/></p><p class="para">A variation on this formula is to determine the number of days of sales contained within the backlog, which is achieved by comparing the backlog to the average daily sales volume that a company typically produces. This formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02008.gif" alt=" " width="174" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The sales and backlog data for the Jabber Phone Company are shown in <a id="c2-tbl-004-1" href="#c2-tbl-004">Table 2.4</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c2-tbl-004" href="#c2-tbl-004-1">TABLE 2.4</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/tableu02004.gif" alt=" " width="554" height="85"/></p><p class="para">This table reveals that the company's sales are continuing to increase over time, while its backlog is decreasing. The change was caused by an increase in the company's productive capacity for additional cell phones. As a result, the company is gradually clearing out its backlog and converting it into sales. However, the management team must be aware that, if the present trend continues, the company will eventually clear out its entire backlog and find itself with a sudden reduction in sales, unless it greatly increases its sales and marketing efforts to build the backlog back up to a higher level.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The sales backlog ratio is less useful for businesses that are oriented toward a just-in-time manufacturing model, since these organizations tend to operate with a reduced backlog. It is also of limited use for highly seasonal businesses, since their intention is to completely clear out their backlogs at the end of the selling season and then build up inventory for the next selling season, even in the absence of a backlog.</p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0007">SALES RETURNS TO GROSS SALES RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio reveals the extent of returns on its sales. An excessive level of returns can be indicative of product flaws requiring replacement, or an overly generous returns policy, or the sudden appearance of a competing product on the market that distributors would rather keep in stock. No matter what the cause, this ratio is a good initial indicator of an underlying problem related to the product, prices, or market.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide total sales returns by gross sales. This ratio can be unusually high or low from month to month, because sales returns are usually related to shipments made in previous months; consequently, a high sales month may have very low associated sales returns, which instead will appear in the ratio for the following month. To avoid this problem, the ratio should be aggregated on a rolling quarterly basis, so that returns will be more likely to be matched against related sales. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02009.gif" alt=" " width="122" height="34"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Matterhorn Pen Company sells the bulk of its pens during the Christmas selling season, with a sharp drop in sales immediately thereafter. <a id="c2-tbl-005-1" href="#c2-tbl-005">Table 2.5</a> shows the sales and return figures for the six months nearest the Christmas season.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c2-tbl-005" href="#c2-tbl-005-1">TABLE 2.5</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/tableu02005.gif" alt=" " width="555" height="83"/></p><p class="para">This table shows that there is a time lag of exactly one month on all sales returns, and that the return rate is always exactly 10% when compared to the gross sales from which the returns originated. Because of the extreme seasonality of sales, however, the returns ratio varies enormously from period to period, with the worst case being in January, when the returns from the massive December sales month are offset against the puny January postseason sales. To fix this problem, the controller elects to measure the ratio on a rolling three-month basis, which smoothes out the ratio somewhat, as shown in <a id="c2-tbl-006-1" href="#c2-tbl-006">Table 2.6</a>. However, the returns attributable to the December sales month occur in January, which therefore still appear in the March three-month rolling measurement when the corresponding sales have dropped out. To avoid this problem, reporting the measure could be delayed by one month on an ongoing basis so that the most recent month's returns could be divided by the sales from the preceding month.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c2-tbl-006" href="#c2-tbl-006-1">TABLE 2.6</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/tableu02006.gif" alt=" " width="555" height="84"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The amount of sales returns can be masked, rendering this ratio less informative. For example, a company can offer free extra products or services to a customer who wishes to make a return rather than accepting the returned goods. Another ploy is to charge off to expense an unreasonably high or low return reserve or to roll returns into some other account. Also, unusual returns, such as products that are being called back to the factory to repair a serious flaw, may be recorded against a special loss reserve. Another variation is to shift returned goods back into finished goods inventory and then write up the value of this inventory without ever making a charge against sales. By any or all of these means, a company can hide the true amount of its sales returns.</p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0008">REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE TO FIXED ASSETS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio is useful for estimating the age of the collective group of fixed assets listed in the financial statements. If the ratio follows an increasing trend line, then the company is probably in need of some asset replacements. An increasing trend line may also be indicative of high asset-usage levels, which can prematurely require advanced levels of repair work. Of particular interest is an increasing ratio that suddenly drops with no corresponding increase in the amount of fixed assets. This indicates that a company is running out of cash and cannot afford to repair its existing assets or purchase new ones.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total amount of repairs and maintenance expense by the total amount of fixed assets. If the expense is broken down into subcategories, such as between production equipment and facilities, then the measure can be calculated for each category presented. It is better to calculate the ratio with the total amount of fixed assets in the denominator, rather than net of depreciation, since the type of accelerated depreciation method would otherwise affect the amount of net assets used in the calculation. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02010.gif" alt=" " width="254" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Hot Cinnamon Candy Company is being examined by the due diligence team of another candy company, which may decide to make an acquisition offer. The due diligence team has collected information about the company, as shown in <a id="c2-tbl-007-1" href="#c2-tbl-007">Table 2.7</a>. </p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c2-tbl-007" href="#c2-tbl-007-1">TABLE 2.7</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/tableu02007.gif" alt=" " width="555" height="139"/></p><p class="para">This table shows the impending demise of the candy company—sales are dropping, which may be the cause of a continuing decline in available cash and an increase in the amount of debt. Of particular concern is the sudden drop in the amount of repairs expense in Year 4, because there is no corresponding increase in the fixed assets account that would indicate that new assets have been purchased. The due diligence team should conclude that a purchase of this company would require a cash infusion to fix a backlog of equipment repairs.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As noted earlier, the ratio can be manipulated by company management if it chooses to delay making expenditures on needed asset repairs. Also, a high ratio can yield misleading conclusions, because it can indicate that management is taking the best possible care of its equipment or that the equipment is so old that it is near the point of failure. Also, the amount of repairs and maintenance expense can be manipulated by shifting the salaries of the equipment repair staff to some other overhead category or by outsourcing the work. Finally, this ratio may not change much from period to period in those situations in which a company employs a repair team whose wages will be charged to the repairs account at all times, even if there are no repairs to be made.</p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0009">ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION TO FIXED ASSETS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Comparing the amount of accumulated depreciation to the gross amount of fixed assets recorded on a company's balance sheet can indicate the extent to which a company has continued to replace its existing assets with new ones on an ongoing basis. For example, if the proportion of accumulated depreciation to fixed assets is quite high, it is evidence that not too many assets have been added by a company in recent years, which may in turn lead one to suspect that there is little cash available for such investments. </p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total accumulated depreciation by the total amount of fixed assets.

The financial information under review is limited and does not contain a sufficient degree of information regarding cash flows from year to year. Consequently, the acquirer is trying to get a general idea of the company's ability to generate cash by reviewing the expenditures it has made for fixed assets. The assumption is that an increase in the ratio of accumulated depreciation to fixed assets over time is an indicator of a shortage in cash.

Under this treatment, depreciation levels will rise rapidly, leading one to believe that a company's asset base is older than it really is. Also, a company owning long-term assets that require minimal replacement will also show a high ratio of accumulated depreciation to fixed assets, even though there is no particular need to buy new equipment. In this case, one should look at the amount of repairs and maintenance expense to see if a proper level of expenditures is being made to keep the equipment operational. Finally, a company's accounting staff may not be making journal entries that would eliminate from the balance sheet the asset cost and accumulated depreciation associated with assets that are no longer on the premises. If so, the volume of accumulated depreciation listed in the balance sheet may appear to be quite high; this is evidence less of improper asset management and more of inadequate accounting for eliminated assets.</p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0010">CAPITAL TO LABOR RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> There is a general tendency among businesses to invest more in capital assets if they have a high cost of labor on the grounds that it is less expensive to automate certain tasks than to pay wages for the same tasks. Conversely, there is a tendency not to invest in capital assets when the cost of labor is low, since it is not cost-effective to do so. The capital to labor ratio calculates this proportion. It is most useful to do so over a lengthy time, to see whether there is a trend in one direction or the other. An increasing proportion can signal that the total cost of labor has risen so much that management is seeking to use automation to remain competitive in its market.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the book value of all tangible fixed assets by the fully burdened cost of labor.

One of its problems is that direct labor has historically been the most common activity measure used to derive it, even though direct labor composes an increasingly small proportion of the production process; consequently, the ratio of overhead costs to direct labor incurred is quite high, so a small change in the direct labor applied to a product will also result in a much larger change in the amount of overhead cost that is applied to it.</p><p class="para">Another problem is that there may be little relationship between the overhead cost pool and any single activity measure—instead, machine hours are only related to machine repairs and utilities, while supervisory salaries are related to an entire production line, rent is related to the square footage used by a production line, and so on. A properly applied activity-based costing system will avoid this issue by using a variety of activity measures to determine the most accurate application of overhead costs.</p><p class="para">Yet another problem is presented by throughput accounting; under this concept, the only issue that matters to a company is its ability to schedule its manufacturing process around one or more bottleneck operations within the facility. If overhead is incurred to reduce the load on the bottleneck, then profits may still increase despite the increase in expense. Under this concept, the application of overhead costs is irrelevant.</p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0017">GOODWILL TO ASSETS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The Financial Accounting Standards Board no longer requires companies to amortize the goodwill that is recorded on their balance sheets, preferring instead to have them write down goodwill only after determining that it has been impaired. This can cause problems for the investor, who may be faced with situations in which large proportions of company assets are made up of this intangible, with no ongoing and consistent goodwill write-down that will gradually eliminate it. One can use the goodwill to assets ratio to see whether there is an excessive proportion of goodwill on a company's balance sheet or whether the ratio is increasing over time.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide unamortized goodwill by total assets. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02021.gif" alt=" " width="142" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Genex Snowboard Company has purchased several of its competitors over the past few years, gradually increasing its share of the market for premium racing snowboards. However, it has made these acquisitions at a large premium over the fair market value of the underlying assets. Also, the combined entity has not seen a dramatic rise in sales or profits as a result of the acquisitions. The primary group of investors is becoming concerned that there might be a goodwill write-down in the near future. Before going to company management about the issue, they review the information in <a id="c2-tbl-0016-1" href="#c2-tbl-0016">Table 2.16</a> about the goodwill to assets ratio for the past five years.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c2-tbl-0016" href="#c2-tbl-0016-1">TABLE 2.16</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/tableu02016.gif" alt=" " width="554" height="90"/></p><p class="para">Though it is impossible to tell from the presented numbers if there is an incipient write-down in the future, the goodwill to assets ratio for the company has increased markedly over the past few years, and now stands at about one half of all assets. It appears to be time for the investors to make their concerns known to the company's board of directors.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Although the goodwill to assets ratio is a good way to highlight the possible presence of an overabundance of goodwill, there is no way to tell how much of it is likely to result in a sudden write-down. A company with only a small proportion of goodwill to assets may be just as likely to write down goodwill as a company that has an overwhelmingly large proportion of it.</p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0018">OVERHEAD TO COST OF SALES RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A long-term trend over the past century has been a gradual replacement of direct labor costs by overhead costs within the cost of goods sold. Overhead now comprises the largest proportion of costs within this category for many companies. Given its increasing importance, an overhead to cost of sales ratio is needed so that managers can see whether there are continuing increases in overhead costs that require action to reduce. Several variations on this formula are noted in the following section.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide total overhead expenses by the cost of goods sold. To get some idea of the changes in this ratio over time, it is important to incorporate the same costs in the overhead cost pool in every measurement period. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02022.gif" alt=" " width="158" height="40"/></p><p class="para">A variation on the ratio is to divide total overhead expenses by the combination of direct materials expenses and direct labor expenses. This approach removes overhead from the denominator. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02023.gif" alt=" " width="199" height="37"/></p><p class="para">Another variation is to divide total overhead expenses by just direct materials, thereby removing both direct labor and overhead costs from the denominator. This approach compares overhead to the only direct cost clearly associated with the manufacturing process (since direct labor is sometimes considered to be a fixed cost in the short term). The formula is: </p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn02024.gif" alt=" " width="150" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Snoozer Mattress Factory has gradually altered its production process so that it now contains a large amount of automated materials handling and production equipment. This has resulted in a significant reduction in direct labor costs and an increase in overhead costs. The CFO wants to conduct a before-and-after comparison of the overhead to cost of sales ratio to see how these changes have altered the company's cost structure. She compiles the information in <a id="c2-tbl-0017-1" href="#c2-tbl-0017">Table 2.17</a>. </p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c2-tbl-0017" href="#c2-tbl-0017-1">TABLE 2.17</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Before Changes</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">After Changes</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Overhead expenses</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,458,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$2,045,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Direct materials</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$375,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$410,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Direct labor</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$720,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$302,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Overhead to cost of sales ratio</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">133%</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">287%</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The CFO chooses to use the ratio formulation in which both direct labor and direct materials are included in the denominator. The results show more than a doubling of overhead costs in proportion to direct costs. A further evaluation for the CFO at this point will determine how this change has altered the company's break-even point; with such a large increase in overhead costs, it is likely that the break-even point has also increased.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Overhead costs tend to be fixed in the short term, while the mostly direct costs included in the denominator will vary with sales. This means that the ratio can vary substantially from period to period if sales fluctuate considerably. To avoid this problem, it may be necessary to use an average cost in the denominator that consists of a rolling average that covers multiple reporting periods. By doing so, there will be no sharp fluctuations in the denominator, thereby making the comparison to overhead costs more useful. </p><p class="h1" id="c02-sec1-0019">INVESTMENT TURNOVER</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The investment turnover measurement is used by investors to determine the ability of a company to convert its debt and equity into dollars of sales.

It measures the sales level at which a company exactly breaks even. This figure is useful for a number of operating decisions, such as determining how much extra productive capacity is available after break-even sales have been manufactured, which tells the management team how much profit can theoretically be generated at maximum capacity levels. It is also good for determining changes in the break-even point resulting from decisions to add fixed costs (especially when replacing variable production costs with fixed automation costs) and figuring changes in profits when the sales staff is contemplating making changes in product prices.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the average gross margin percentage into total operating costs.

However, the removal of some key overhead costs reduces the break-even point to such an extent that the acquirer will be able to generate a significant return from the existing sales level. The revised break-even level is determined by subtracting the operating expense reductions of $750,000 from the existing operating expenses of $3,500,000, and then dividing the remaining $2,750,000 in operating expenses by the gross margin of 35% to arrive at a new break-even point of $7,857,000.
