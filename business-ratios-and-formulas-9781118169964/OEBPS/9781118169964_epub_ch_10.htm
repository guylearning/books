There are no financial measurements listed here at all. Instead, the formulas cover such operational issues as bill of material accuracy, reuse of parts in new product designs, and ability to reach target costs.</p><p class="para">The measurements discussed in this chapter include:</p><table class="bodytable" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell">Bill of Materials Accuracy</td><td class="bodycell">Percentage of Products Reaching Market before Competition</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Labor Routing Accuracy</td><td class="bodycell">Return on Innovation Investment</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Idea Kill Rate</td><td class="bodycell">Intangibility Index</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Percentage of New Products Introduced</td><td class="bodycell">Science Linkage Index</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Percentage of Sales from New Products</td><td class="bodycell">Ratio of Actual to Target Cost</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Percentage of New Parts Used in New Products</td><td class="bodycell">Warranty Claims Percentage</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Percentage of Existing Parts Reused in New Products</td><td class="bodycell">Time from Design Inception to Production</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Average Number of Distinct Products per Design Platform</td><td class="bodycell">Percentage of Floor Space Utilization</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0001">BILL OF MATERIALS ACCURACY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The engineering department is responsible for the release of a bill of materials for each product that it designs. The bill of materials should specify exactly what components are needed to build a product, and the quantities required for each part. This information is used by the logistics staff to ensure that the correct parts are available when the manufacturing process begins. An accuracy rating of at least 98% is needed for this measurement so products can be manufactured with a minimum of stoppages caused by missing parts.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of accurate parts (defined as the correct part number, unit of measure, and quantity) listed in a bill of materials by the total number of parts listed in the bill. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10001.gif" alt=" " width="322" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Bouncing Baby High Chair Company makes high chairs. Its engineering group has just released the bill of materials for a new plastic chair. The production manager suspects that the new product's bill of materials is incorrect, given a long history of bill inaccuracies. <a id="c10-tbl-001-1" href="#c10-tbl-001">Table 10.1</a> shows a copy of the bill.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c10-tbl-001" href="#c10-tbl-001-1">TABLE 10.1</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table10001.gif" alt="table" width="556" height="219"/><p class="para">The production manager's review reveals that there are two mistakes in the bill of materials. The unit of measure for the product label is incorrectly specified as being a roll, when it should be each, and the quantity listed for box should be one, rather than two. In both cases, using the bill of materials would have resulted in a considerable overordering of product labels and boxes for the product. Since 2 of the 10 items on the bill of materials are incorrect, the bill is only 80% accurate.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Though the minimum acceptable level of accuracy is 98%, this is an area in which nothing less than 100% accuracy is required to ensure that the production process runs smoothly. A great deal of attention should consequently be focused on this measurement.</p><p class="para">The timing of the release of the bill of materials is another problem. If an engineering staff is late in issuing a proper bill of materials, then the logistics group must scramble to bring in the correct parts in time for the start of the production process. Measuring the timing of the bill's release as well as its accuracy can prevent this problem by focusing the engineering staff's attention on it.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0002">LABOR ROUTING ACCURACY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This measurement is created by the industrial engineering staff, and is intended to provide the production planning staff with a listing of the production times needed at all work stations through which a product must pass during the manufacturing process. By multiplying a product's labor routing by the number of units to be produced, the production planning staff can tell how much direct labor and machining time is needed to complete a production run. A labor routing accuracy level of 95% is considered the minimum acceptable level to plan production properly.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Summarize the total number of correct machining times and machine codes in each labor routing, and divide by the total number of line items in the routing. When calculating this measurement, a line item should be considered incorrect if either the machining time or the machine code (which identifies the correct work station to be used) is incorrect. Having one or the other correct does not mean that the entire line should be listed as correct for the purposes of the calculation. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10002.gif" alt=" " width="358" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Burly Barbecue Grille Company manufactures the beefiest grill on the planet. It requires a number of production steps to complete, as outlined in the labor routing shown in <a id="c10-tbl-002-1" href="#c10-tbl-002">Table 10.2</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c10-tbl-002" href="#c10-tbl-002-1">TABLE 10.2</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell">Step Number</td><td class="headercell">Work Station</td><td class="headercell">Minutes</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Kitting</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">25</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Hole punch</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">15</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">3</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Riveting</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">40</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">4</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Quality station</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">10</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">5</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Burnishing</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">60</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">6</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Label station</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">5</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">7</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Electrical</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">20</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">8</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Paint shop</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">120</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">9</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Quality station</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">10</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">10</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Boxing</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">5</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The production-scheduling staff finds that the paint shop is consistently overburdened with a lengthy queue of grills. Further investigation reveals that the 120 minutes of time listed for the paint shop in step 8 is too low by 40 minutes. The labor routing accuracy for this product is therefore measured at 90% (9 of 10 items being correct), and the time for the paint shop is adjusted up to 160 minutes, which immediately eliminates the bottleneck problem at the paint shop.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The level of precision required for a labor routing is especially important when very short processing times are required for each production station, since a small error in an already-small number can have a major impact when multiplied by a large production run. For example, there is little cause for concern if a three-hour production time is off by a minute, but there is if a four-second production time is incorrect by a second (which is 25% off of the actual production time). The calculation of labor routing accuracy should consequently be based on getting the estimated time correct to within a certain percentage of the actual time. A common figure is to assume that the estimated routing time is correct if it is plus or minus 5% of the actual time.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0003">IDEA KILL RATE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> An organization having a strong commitment to new product development should have a system in place for generating and evaluating a large number of new product ideas. The business then sifts and grades the ideas to find the few that have strong prospects for profitability. This means that a large number of ideas should be killed off throughout the product evaluation process. Thus, it is useful to see if a company's idea kill rate is high enough. If not, it may not be generating enough ideas, or it may be allowing average product concepts to continue too deeply into the product design process. An implication of a low kill rate is that a company is not generating enough high-risk ideas; these are most likely to be eliminated, but those remaining can have exceptionally high returns on investment.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total number of ideas killed during the measurement period by the average number of ideas under consideration during the period. It may be useful to use a fairly lengthy measurement period, such as a quarter or a year; most companies do not have a sufficiently large product development process in place to warrant more frequent measurement. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10003.gif" alt=" " width="542" height="60"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Desert Designs creates a variety of motorized cooking devices, and stays ahead of the competition through continual innovation. Its president believes there has been a decline in the quality of its products over the past few years, and compiles the following information about idea development over the past four years to prove her point:</p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/tableu10001.gif" alt=" " width="563" height="108"/></p><p class="para">The table shows that the president's concern is warranted. The number of ideas under consideration has remained about the same over time, while the kill rate has declined. The implication is that less innovative ideas are being brought to market.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Do not just document that ideas were killed—find out <span class="italilc">why</span> they were killed. This can result in a change in the process of generating new ideas. Also, it may indicate that a particular person or concept is behind the elimination of certain types of ideas. In addition, consider exploring where ideas are killed in the product evaluation process. This should occur throughout the product development process, as concepts are further refined, tested, and eliminated.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0004">PERCENTAGE OF NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The percentage of new products introduced is of great importance in high-fashion consumer markets, where existing products may last for only a few months before being replaced. However, it may be of little consequence in more staid industries where new products only appear every few years. Thus, the applicability of this measure will depend on the competitive situation in which a company finds itself.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of new products introduced in the measurement period by the total number of new products available at the beginning of the period. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10004.gif" alt=" " width="414" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The VibroMatic Massage Company has been producing the same massage chair for the past decade. Its new president wants to shake up the industry by releasing a series of designer-model massage chairs in a range of price points. Accordingly, the president bases the bonus plan for the engineering manager on the percentage of new products introduced. At the end of the measurement period, the percentage of completion for the various product designs is shown in <a id="c10-tbl-003-1" href="#c10-tbl-003">Table 10.3</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c10-tbl-003" href="#c10-tbl-003-1">TABLE 10.3</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell">Design</td><td class="headercell">Status</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Micro-massage chair</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">In production</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Massage stool</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">In tooling</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Mongo deluxe massage</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Design approved</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Foot massage bolster</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">In design</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Office massage chair</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">In design</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The company had a total of five production models at the beginning of the measurement period. Based on the table, the president can pay a bonus based on the one model that has made it into production, or the two that have at least reached the tooling stage, or the three that have at least reached the design stage. The president reviews the engineering manager's job description and concludes that those job responsibilities end at the design stage, after which other people are responsible for tooling and production. For bonus payment purposes, the products are measured as having been completed once their designs have been approved, which means that three new products were completed during the period for measurement purposes. This results in the following percentage of new products introduced:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10005.gif" alt=" " width="370" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The design team being measured may attempt to define minor product variations as new products. Since incremental product changes may be released with great regularity, this would yield a very high new product performance measurement. To keep this from happening, specify that only those products using an entirely new product platform, or that use a minimum percentage of entirely new parts, will be considered new products.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0005">PERCENTAGE OF SALES FROM NEW PRODUCTS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The preceding measurement can force an engineering department into the wholesale production of new products, but will not necessarily result in well-targeted products that bring in a significant amount of new revenue. This problem can be avoided by using the percentage of sales from new products measurement, which focuses management attention on the practical results of new product development.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide total sales from new products by total sales. A variation is to use in the numerator the sales from any products developed within a predefined number of years; for example, one consumer products company measures the percentage of new sales generated by products that have been developed within the past three years. By using this slightly longer time frame, the highs and lows caused by individual product launches can be smoothed out. The basic formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10006.gif" alt=" " width="158" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Tuff Man Exercise Equipment Company is engaged in rapidly broadening its lineup of weightlifting machines for the home market. Its controller wants to determine the percentage of sales from new products, based on <a id="c10-tbl-004-1" href="#c10-tbl-004">Table 10.4</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c10-tbl-004" href="#c10-tbl-004-1">TABLE 10.4</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell">Equipment Name</td><td class="headercell">New/Existing</td><td class="headercell">Sales</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Squat rack</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">New</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$138,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Bench press</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">New</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$208,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Preacher bench</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">New</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$54,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Lat pulldown</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Existing</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$192,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Quad extension</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Existing</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$147,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">—</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$739,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">Based on the information in the table, the controller calculates the percentage of sales from new products as follows:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10007.gif" alt=" " width="399" height="88"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The key problem with this measurement is the definition of a new product. For example, should a product be included that varies from the old product line only in that it has a new color, a change in packaging, or some slight functional improvement? There needs to be a definition of a new product that will keep these slightly improved products from being included in the numerator of the measurement. For example, specify that only those products containing at least 25% new parts can be designated new products or only those that use an entirely new design platform. An alternative is to divide new-product sales into different categories, such as incremental improvements, major improvements, and entirely new product lines. Although the precise classification is judgmental, it does give management a rough estimate of the types of new-product sales being generated.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0006">PERCENTAGE OF NEW PARTS USED IN NEW PRODUCTS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A continuing problem for a company's logistics staff is the volume of new parts that the engineering department specifies for each new product. This can result in an extraordinary number of parts to keep track of, which entails additional purchasing and materials-handling costs. From the perspective of saving costs for the entire company, it makes a great deal of sense to encourage engineers to design products that share components with existing products. This approach leverages new products from the existing workload of the purchasing and materials-handling staffs, and has the added benefit of avoiding an investment in inventory for new parts. For these reasons, the percentage of new parts used in new products is an excellent choice of performance measurement.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of new parts in a bill of materials by the total number of parts in a bill of materials. Many companies do not include fittings and fasteners in the bill of materials, since they keep large quantities of these items on hand at all times and charge them off to current expenses. If so, there are fewer parts to include in the calculation, making the measurement much easier to complete. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10008.gif" alt=" " width="259" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The logistics manager of the Illuminato Flashlight Company has not achieved a bonus target for inventory reduction in five years. The manager complains to the president that the fault does not lie with him but rather with the engineering department, which persists in issuing flashlights whose components are entirely new, resulting in rampant increases in the number of components kept in stock. To determine whether design changes can reduce inventory levels, the president includes the percentage of new parts used in new products in the engineering manager's performance compensation plan for the next year. The bill of materials for one of the company's new flashlight models can be seen in <a id="c10-tbl-005-1" href="#c10-tbl-005">Table 10.5</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c10-tbl-005" href="#c10-tbl-005-1">TABLE 10.5</a></span></p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table10005.gif" alt=" " width="558" height="222"/></p><p class="para">Based on the information in the table, the performance measure for this single product would be:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10009.gif" alt=" " width="457" height="34"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Engineers may argue against the use of this measurement on the grounds that it provides a disincentive for them to locate more reliable or less expensive parts, or both, with which to replace existing components. Although this measure can act as a block to such beneficial activities, a measurement system can avoid this problem by focusing on long-term declines in the cost of products or increases in the level of quality. A combined set of these measurements can be an effective way to focus on the most appropriate design initiatives by the engineering department.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0007">PERCENTAGE OF EXISTING PARTS REUSED IN NEW PRODUCTS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The inverse of the preceding measurement can be used to determine the proportion of existing parts that are used in new products. However, as the formula reveals, this measurement is slightly different from an inverse measurement. This variation is used by companies that have compiled an approved list of parts that are to be used in new product designs, which is a subset of all existing parts. By concentrating on the use of an approved parts list in new products, a company can incorporate high-quality, low-cost components for its products.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of approved parts in a new product's bill of materials by the total number of parts in the bill. If there is no approved components list, then the only alternative is to use the set of all existing components from which to select items for the numerator, which will likely result in a higher percentage. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10010.gif" alt=" " width="287" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Sticky Thought Tape Dispenser Company has just issued a new executive-style tape dispenser. Its bill of materials contains 20 parts, of which 18 are existing components and 12 are on the approved parts list. What is the engineering department's performance in using existing parts? The answer is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10011.gif" alt=" " width="533" height="34"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Since a complex product will probably contain one or more subassemblies rather than individual components, verify that selected subassemblies are also on the approved parts list; otherwise, subassemblies will be rejected for the purposes of this measurement.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0008">AVERAGE NUMBER OF DISTINCT PRODUCTS PER DESIGN PLATFORM</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A major problem for car companies has been the proliferation of car models, few of which share the same underlying design platform. By fostering such a plethora of models, the companies have run into difficulties with too many production lines, each of which is tooled to manufacture only one model. Another problem that arises is the vast array of components needed to assemble the many models, plus a great deal of engineering design time to create each model from scratch rather than starting with a common base of platform designs. This measurement is designed to bring this problem to the attention of management.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total number of distinct products by the total number of design platforms. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10012.gif" alt=" " width="215" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Tongan Motors, the massive automobile manufacturer that conveniently ships to anywhere on the Pacific Rim from its Pacific island base, is suffering from an overabundance of design platforms. It currently has 42 auto models that are based on 36 design platforms, which results in a very poor ratio of products to platforms of 1.2 products per platform. It plans to cancel 20 platforms outright and issue enough new designs to increase its ratio of models to platforms to 3.0:1.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The key issue is in deciding what variations on a product are termed distinct products. For example, the same product in 10 different colors is still just one product, while the basic and deluxe models of a product both probably start with the same essential product design, and so can be regarded as a single product. This issue can be of more than academic interest, since anyone wanting to show good results under this measurement will be inclined to reclassify everything as a new product and add it to the numerator of the formula.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0009">PERCENTAGE OF PRODUCTS REACHING MARKET BEFORE COMPETITION</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A common problem is for the engineering department to be so proud of its new products that it fails to release its designs until they become works of art. Although this may result in great designer satisfaction, it also means that other companies can bring their less-perfect products to market much sooner, thereby grabbing market share. The percentage of products reaching the market before the competition can be measured to determine whether this is a problem.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of products released before those of the competition by the total number of products that a company releases. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10013.gif" alt=" " width="308" height="40"/></p><p class="para">It may be difficult to determine the precise dates on which competing products are released, or there may be no discernible competing products. If so, an easier measurement is to focus on the number of products released on or before their targeted dates. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10014.gif" alt=" " width="264" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The managers of the Hercules Shoe Company, makers of shoes for weight lifters, want to pursue an aggressive schedule of new product releases during the upcoming year, which will require a great deal of effort by their shoe design teams.

There may be problems in procuring parts, which is the responsibility of the purchasing staff; manufacturing flaws that must be resolved by the production staff; and delivery issues for which the distribution employees are responsible. Consequently, many of the reasons for a late product launch can be traced to other departments than engineering. To avoid this problem, the second of the two formulas, which focuses on meeting a designated design release date, focuses attention squarely on the efforts of the engineering staff.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0010">RETURN ON INNOVATION INVESTMENT</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Determining the proper amount of funding to assign to the research and development budget in order to create new product opportunities is quite difficult. The calculation of the return on the investment in research and development is substantially easier, however, since it relies upon historical information. It is called the return on innovation investment, and the basic concept is to divide the profits from new products by the costs involved in bringing them to market. This measure can be used for individual products, or for the entire investment in innovation over long periods of time.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the net after-tax profit associated with new products by the cost of the research and development efforts needed to create them. The amount in the denominator can also include the marketing cost associated with launching each product since this is an integral part of the rollout of the product. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10016.gif" alt=" " width="520" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Tofu Creations Company has made an ongoing investment in new tofu-based products to help it overcome the concern of consumers that tofu has an excessively bland taste. In the past five years, it has invested $12 million in research and development and $3 million in the marketing of product launches. The new products resulting from these investments have created net profits of $7.5 million over the same period. This translates to a total return on innovation investment of 50% over the five-year period, or 10% per year.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> If you only calculate and report the return on innovation investment for a specific product, you are understating the cost of innovation, since you are presumably reporting only on the results of a successful product. Report instead on the basis of all investments in innovation for a fairly long period of time, such as a year, to arrive at a measure that includes failed products as well.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0011">INTANGIBILITY INDEX</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The engineering department is frequently judged based on the amount of capital assets that it installs each year. In this scenario, management's expectations of the department are clearly based on the amount of hardware the company owns. What if the company has shifted in the direction of more research and development (R&amp;D), however, which is becoming more common in our knowledge-based economy? A possible measurement of this shift is the intangibility index, whereby the funds spent on R&amp;D are compared to capital spending. In many cases, the ratio is much higher than 1:1, indicating a strong shift toward the accumulation of knowledge through R&amp;D activities.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide total annual R&amp;D expenses by total annual capital spending. Do not reduce the capital spending figure by any depreciation expense incurred during the measurement period. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10017.gif" alt=" " width="312" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Tidal Energy Company (TEC) creates electrical generators that are triggered by wave action. This is cutting-edge technology, requiring a considerable amount of R&amp;D expense. In the past year, TEC spent $28 million on R&amp;D and $4 million on a variety of capital spending projects. Its intangibility index is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10018.gif" alt=" " width="368" height="38"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Some capital expenditures may be made for R&amp;D activities; if readily identifiable, these expenditures should be stripped out of the “total annual capital spending” denominator so as to more clearly show the separation between capital spending and R&amp;D.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0012">SCIENCE LINKAGE INDEX</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> If a company invests a considerable amount of funds in a research and development (R&amp;D) program, it should have a general idea of whether this expense is going toward minor short-term product improvements or fundamental long-term research. It is generally better to allocate a significant proportion of funds toward long-term research, which indicates the presence of long-term planning that will eventually secure a future competitive advantage. The science linkage index shows the mean number of references to scientific publications in the patents granted to a company, with a higher number indicating that a patent is based more on fundamental research.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Summarize the number of research paper references in all patents issued to the company during the previous 12 months, and divide by the number of patents issued. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10019.gif" alt=" " width="312" height="40"/></p><p class="para">This is best used on a trend line, so perform the same calculation over several preceding one-year periods and compare the results to determine whether there is a trend.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Ram-Jet International has developed a series of patents for its hypersonic ramjet engine. Management feels that the company must remain highly focused on fundamental research for it to maintain a competitive long-term advantage over its rivals, and so prefers a high science linkage index. It accumulates the information in <a id="c10-tbl-007-1" href="#c10-tbl-007">Table 10.7</a> for each of the past three years.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c10-tbl-007" href="#c10-tbl-007-1">TABLE 10.7</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table10007.gif" alt=" " width="560" height="112"/><p class="para">Though Ram-Jet has increased the number of patents awarded, its science linkage index has dropped over time, possibly indicating that the company has become more focused on patents with short-term applicability.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Do not use this measure to eliminate spending on short-term R&amp;D efforts! A company must have a mix of both short-term and long-term R&amp;D projects in order to have a continuous pipeline of products going to market. There should be a mix of both types of projects.</p><p class="para">If a company is issued patents in a number of unrelated areas, the science linkage index could vary considerably for R&amp;D in each of the areas. For example, biotechnology patents tend to reference far more scientific papers than R&amp;D in other areas. Thus, the measurement results can vary by research area.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0013">RATIO OF ACTUAL TO TARGET COST</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> In a target-costing environment, the marketing and engineering teams jointly determine the features that a new product should have, as well as the market price it must have to achieve commercial success, and then back into the maximum target cost for the product to attain reasonable margins. The key focus of the product design teams then becomes the construction of a product that meets the predetermined target cost. This measurement is used to determine their success in doing so.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total of actual expected product costs by the total amount of targeted costs. A footnote should accompany this measurement, stating the expected production volume at which the costs are stated. The reason for this extra wording is that component costs can change drastically if assumed volumes vary. For example, if a target cost is based on an expected unit volume of 50,000, but the actual expected costs are based on a revised unit volume of only 10,000, then it is quite likely that the cost of components will increase dramatically. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10020.gif" alt=" " width="182" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The engineering manager for a copier design team is conducting a postdesign review of the team's performance. The team did not meet its target cost goal, and the manager is wondering what could have given an earlier warning of the costing problem. The manager has obtained the information in <a id="c10-tbl-008-1" href="#c10-tbl-008">Table 10.8</a> about design costs over the term of the project.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c10-tbl-008" href="#c10-tbl-008-1">TABLE 10.8</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table10008.gif" alt=" " width="556" height="108"/><p class="para">The measurements in the table show that the design team was on track at the first design milestone by keeping actual expected costs at a level 25% higher than the final target cost. The team slipped significantly at the second milestone, however, and was never able to reduce costs thereafter, resulting in a final design that was 11% more expensive than the target. More active management of the design process after the second milestone might have prevented this problem from arising.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The element missing from this measurement is the quality of the resulting products. A design team can achieve a target cost and issue a completed product design, but if its associated warranty and scrap costs are too high, the lifetime cost of the product to the company will exceed the initial target cost. Consequently, this measure must be coupled with a set of minimum quality specifications; lifetime target costs, rather than initial target product costs, can be tracked to quantify the cost of quality.</p><p class="para">Another issue, as noted in the Formula section, is that the individual component costs used to compile the total target cost can vary greatly, depending on the assumed volume of production; this is because components that are purchased in bulk are typically less expensive than when they are bought in small quantities.</p><p class="para">Another issue is that a design team is usually required to meet increasingly stringent costing targets as it moves closer to the final approval of its product design. As it passes each design milestone, its actual cost should come a bit closer to the target cost. Consequently, it makes sense to calculate this measurement at every milestone and compare it to the target cost at that point, rather than waiting until the completion of the entire project to determine whether the costing goal was attained. By measuring on this trend line, management can spot design cost problems early on and correct them.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0014">WARRANTY CLAIMS PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The reasons why a product may be returned under warranty can be traced to a number of causes, such as poor production methods and low-quality materials, that have nothing to do with the engineering department. However, they may also be due to design flaws that are directly attributable to the engineering staff. If a significant proportion of warranty claims are caused by this problem, then the warranty claims percentage should become part of the measurement package for this department.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total number of warranty claims received by the total number of products sold. A variation on this calculation is to categorize warranty claims by underlying cause, so only those warranty problems arising from engineering issues are included in the numerator. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10021.gif" alt=" " width="271" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The engineering manager of the Lullaby Swing Company is trying to determine the warranty claims percentage for its Baby Care Swing product. The company manufactured this product during the six months leading up to the summer selling season, after which it stopped production, and it does not plan to begin again until the end of the year. A rash of warranty claims were filed toward the end of the summer that appear to be caused by a structural defect in the swing joint that causes collapse after heavy usage. The total number of units produced was 183,000, and the number of claims filed thus far is 1,897. The calculation is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10022.gif" alt=" " width="409" height="89"/></p><p class="para">This is a common situation involving the calculation of warranty claims as a measurement, and is deserving of continued review over several years to determine whether problems continue to arise with this product. The production manager should consider marking the product differently in each successive year, so that returned products can be easily associated with a specific production year.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> There can be a significant time lag between the point when a product is sold and when it is returned under warranty. To obtain a measurement that properly relates the amount of units sold and the number of warranty claims, the measurement period should comprise several months.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0015">TIME FROM DESIGN INCEPTION TO PRODUCTION</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Engineering design teams can take an inordinate amount of time to design a new product, especially if the process suffers from a great deal of design iteration, that is, designs constantly being revised to deal with problems encountered in the industrial design or tooling phases. This is a particularly useful measure when there is a large backlog of design projects, and management is keen on reducing design times to accommodate them all.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the design start date from the completed design sign-off date. This measure can also be subdivided into the design intervals for the product itself, the required tooling, and the production process design. The basic formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10023.gif" alt=" " width="319" height="14"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Svelte Equipment Company, maker of fine weight-lifting equipment, is working on a new set of chrome-plated exercise equipment for the home. There are many separate workout stations in the prospective product line, and the president wants to make sure that they are all completed on time. The relevant information is in <a id="c10-tbl-009-1" href="#c10-tbl-009">Table 10.9</a>, which sets a design time budget for each item of equipment and compares it to the actual time from design inception to completion.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c10-tbl-009" href="#c10-tbl-009-1">TABLE 10.9</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table10009.gif" alt=" " width="559" height="162"/><p class="para">By using this format, the president can see that the design times for the first three projects end up being close to their budgets, while the last two projects require substantially more design time.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The design process may require approvals by departments outside the engineering area, which means that the completion date is outside the engineering manager's control to some extent. Also, some products are revised so frequently that there is little separation between the initial design completion date and the immediate commencement of work on product upgrades and replacements.</p><p class="h1" id="c10-sec1-0016">PERCENTAGE OF FLOOR SPACE UTILIZATION</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The industrial engineering staff is responsible for creating a production process that makes the most efficient use of available floor space so that a company can squeeze the maximum amount of production out of its expensive existing facilities. The percentage of floor space utilization is a useful measure for determining its success in these design efforts.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Add together the amount of floor space used by machinery (including the space around it that is required for safe operations, direct labor personnel, and movement paths for logistical reasons), and divide the sum by the total amount of floor space in the production area. Of the three items listed in the numerator, the one that sparks the most argument is the amount of space required for materials movement; a company can potentially eliminate much of the space currently occupied by all types of inventory, which can be a very large proportion of all production floor space. Some companies may want to run a second utilization percentage that reveals what the utilization would be if inventory levels were optimized. By comparing the existing and optimal figures, the industrial engineering staff can determine whether it should embark on just-in-time systemic changes to achieve the indicated space savings. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu10024.gif" alt=" " width="497" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The industrial engineering manager of the Katana Sword Company, makers of fine Japanese blades, believes that the company can eliminate a great deal of production floor space by rearranging its production equipment in a more compact manner. He derives <a id="c10-tbl-0010-1" href="#c10-tbl-0010">Table 10.10</a> regarding information about floor space utilization.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c10-tbl-0010" href="#c10-tbl-0010-1">TABLE 10.10</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell"></td><td class="headercell">Current</td><td class="headercell">Theoretical</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Space used by machinery</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">12,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">8,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Space used by operators</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2,500</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2,500</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Space used for materials</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">7,500</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2,500</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total floor space</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">25,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">25,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Percentage of floor space utilization</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">88%</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">52%</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">According to the table, the manager is certainly correct in wanting to pursue the rearrangement of equipment on the shop floor, since it will save 4,000 square feet of floor space. However, the manager should also mention the potential savings of 5,000 square feet in materials storage space to the logistics department, so that they can work on this area of improvement as well.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> It is not always efficient to cram production facilities into the smallest possible amount of floor space, since this may interfere with proper logistical flow lines through the facility, resulting in longer travel times for materials. Also, some companies may want more open facilities for marketing reasons, since this configuration looks better when taking customers through the plant.</p><p class="para">Another consideration is whether any floor space can be sold off or subleased if a company uses this measurement as a catalyst to increase its floor space utilization. If a company's production area is highly specialized or incapable of being segregated for other uses, it may not make sense to pursue a consolidation of floor space.</p></div></div>
