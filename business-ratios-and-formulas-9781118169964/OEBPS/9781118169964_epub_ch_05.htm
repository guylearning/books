The measures are used to evaluate a company's viability. This is accomplished by examining a company's ability to collect accounts receivable in an efficient manner, use its inventory within a short time, pay its accounts payable when due, and maintain a sufficient amount of liquid funds to pay off short-term liabilities.</p><p class="para">The titles of the measurements in this chapter are:</p><table class="bodytable" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Accounts Receivable Turnover<br/>Average Receivable Collection Period<br/>Days Delinquent Sales Outstanding<br/>Days Sales in Receivables Index<br/>Accounts Receivable Investment<br/>Ending Receivable Balance<br/>Inventory to Sales Ratio<br/>Inventory Turnover<br/>Inventory to Working Capital Ratio<br/>Liquidity Index<br/>Accounts Payable Days<br/>Accounts Payable Turnover<br/>Current Ratio<br/>Quick Ratio<br/>Cash Ratio</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sales to Current Assets Ratio<br/>Working Capital Productivity<br/>Days of Working Capital<br/>Weighted Working Capital<br/>Defensive Interval Ratio<br/>Current Liability Ratio<br/>Required Current Liabilities to Total Current Liabilities Ratio<br/>Working Capital to Debt Ratio<br/>Risky Asset Conversion Ratio<br/>Noncurrent Assets to Noncurrent Liabilities Ratio<br/>Short-Term Debt to Long-Term Debt Ratio<br/>Altman's Z-Score Bankruptcy Prediction Formula</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0001">ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TURNOVER</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The speed with which a company can obtain payment from customers for outstanding receivable balances is crucial for the reduction of cash requirements. A very high level of accounts receivable turnover indicates that a company's credit and collections function is very good at avoiding potentially delinquent customers, as well as collecting overdue funds.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide annualized credit sales by the sum of average accounts receivable and notes due from customers. The key issue in this calculation is the concept of annualized credit sales. If a company is estimating very high sales levels later in the year, this can result in an inordinately large figure in the numerator, against which current receivables are compared, which in turn results in an inaccurately high level of turnover. A better approach is to simply multiply the current month's sales by 12 to derive the annualized credit sales figure. Another alternative is to annualize the last two months of sales, on the grounds that the receivables balance relates primarily to sales in those two months. The exact measurement method used can result in some variation in the reported level of turnover, so one should model the results using several different approaches to arrive at the one that most closely approximates reality. The basic formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05001.gif" alt=" " width="380" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Samson Baggage Company, maker of indestructible luggage for adventure travelers, is growing at a very fast clip—so fast that it is running out of money. The management team needs to conserve cash and decides to review accounts receivable to determine whether this might be a likely source. The controller accumulates the data in <a id="c5-tbl-001-1" href="#c5-tbl-001">Table 5.1</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c5-tbl-001" href="#c5-tbl-001-1">TABLE 5.1</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">One Year Ago</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Today</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Annualized credit sales</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$13,100,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$28,500,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Average accounts receivable</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,637,500</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$4,750,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Accounts receivable turnover</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">8</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">6</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The table indicates that accounts receivable turnover has worsened from eight to six within the past year. If the turnover rate had remained the same as one year ago, the amount of accounts receivable outstanding would have been $3,562,500, which is derived by dividing annualized sales of $28,500,000 by turnover of eight. The difference between the $3,562,500 in receivables at eight turns and the current $4,750,000 at six turns is $1,187,500 that could be converted into cash. Based on this information, the management team decides to tighten credit policies, purchase collection software, and add more collections staff.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Many accounting software packages will derive the accounts receivable turnover figure for the user. However, these packages use a different calculation, which is to calculate the average number of days outstanding for each open invoice. This method works fine, but only if the calculation is a weighted average that is based on the amount of each receivable. Otherwise, a very small invoice that is many days overdue can skew the turnover figure considerably.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0002">AVERAGE RECEIVABLE COLLECTION PERIOD</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Some people find that the accounts receivable turnover figure is easier to understand if it is expressed in terms of the average number of days that accounts receivable are outstanding. This format is particularly useful when it is compared to the standard number of days of credit granted to customers. For example, if the average collection period is 60 days and the standard days of credit is 30, then customers are taking much too long to pay their invoices. A sign of good performance is when the average receivable collection period is only a few days longer than the standard days of credit.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide annual credit sales by 365 days, and divide the result into average accounts receivable. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05002.gif" alt=" " width="184" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The new controller of the Flexo Paneling Company, makers of modularized office equipment, wants to determine the company's accounts receivable collection period. In the June accounting period, the beginning accounts receivable balance was $318,000, and the ending balance was $383,000. Sales for May and June totaled $625,000. Based on this information, the controller calculates the average receivable collection period as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05003.gif" alt=" " width="455" height="150"/></p><p class="para">Note that the controller derived the annual sales figure used in the denominator by multiplying the two-month sales period in May and June by six. Since the company has a stated due date of 30 days after the billing date, the 34.1-day collection period appears reasonable.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The main issue is what figure to use for annual sales. If the total sales for the year are used, this may result in a skewed measurement, since the sales associated with the current outstanding accounts receivable may be significantly higher or lower than the average level of sales represented by the annual sales figure. This problem is especially common when sales are highly seasonal. A better approach is to annualize the sales figure for the period covered by the bulk of the existing accounts receivable.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0003">DAYS DELINQUENT SALES OUTSTANDING</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> There is no collection problem with the vast majority of accounts receivable. Recognizing this, some managers prefer to focus the attention of their collection staffs more precisely on their ability to collect money from those few accounts that do not pay on time. The days delinquent sales outstanding measure is an effective way to use this, since it only addresses those invoices that are overdue.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide annualized credit sales from delinquent accounts by the average amount of delinquent accounts receivable, and then divide the result into 365 days. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05004.gif" alt=" " width="367" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Clean Carburetor Company (CCC) sells its product to several specialty engine manufacturers, some of whom are being squeezed on prices by the major car manufacturers, and so pay their bills late. The collections manager of CCC wants to reduce this problem by aggressively pursuing slow payers. The first step in this process is to measure the days of delinquent sales outstanding. The annualized credit sales from delinquent accounts is $4,350,000 and the average delinquent accounts receivable figure is $815,000. With this information, the collections manager uses the following formula to arrive at the ratio:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05005.gif" alt=" " width="427" height="173"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> One problem with this measure is determining the point at which an account receivable is considered to be delinquent. For example, if the allowable payment period for an invoice is 30 days, most customers will pay the bill on the 30th day, so it will not arrive by mail for several more days. Consequently, using 30 days as the cutoff period will include nearly all unpaid invoices. There is no standard approach to determining the cutoff point, but it is reasonable to allow up to a week of extra time beyond the allowed payment period before classifying an invoice as delinquent.</p><p class="para">Another problem with this measurement is determining the amount of the average delinquent account receivable. If the subject company is small, it is likely that there are only a few delinquent invoices, so the collection of just a few of them will significantly alter the average amount. This is less of an issue for large companies, where there are so many more outstanding invoices that the collection of one or two will not have a significant impact on the average amount outstanding.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0004">DAYS SALES IN RECEIVABLES INDEX</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Although changes in credit policies and collection activities can alter the ratio of accounts receivable to sales, this tends to be a consistent ratio from period to period. When the ratio increases over the preceding period (e.g., is greater than one), it is possible that a company is reporting false sales figures so as to buoy its reported level of profitability. The days sales in receivables index is a simple approach for determining whether this may be the case. The underlying concept for the index is that the offsetting entry to a false sale will be accounts receivable, which will therefore increase, since there is no way that the false receivable can be collected and converted into cash. A sudden jump in the proportion of accounts receivable to sales can therefore be construed as being caused by the addition of false sales.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the sales in period two (the most recent period) by accounts receivable for the same period. Then run the same calculation for period one (the preceding period), and divide the result into the ratio for period two. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05006.gif" alt=" " width="219" height="106"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The management of the Optico Fiber Company, a publicly held manufacturer of fiber cables and connection equipment, is suspicious of a sudden rise in reported sales levels, especially since the increase was just enough for several sales personnel to achieve their year-end bonuses. They bring in a fraud auditor, who compiles information for all four quarters of the year, shown in <a id="c5-tbl-002-1" href="#c5-tbl-002">Table 5.2</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c5-tbl-002" href="#c5-tbl-002-1">TABLE 5.2</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table05002.gif" alt=" " width="561" height="105"/></p><p class="para">There is no ratio calculation for the first quarter, since there is no preceding period against which a comparison can be made. In the remaining quarters, the fraud auditor finds that the ratio is roughly the same for the second and third quarters, and then jumps dramatically in the final quarter. This is reasonable grounds for suspecting fraud, so the management team authorizes a more in-depth analysis of the situation.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As noted in the description, a change in credit policy or collection methods can also affect this ratio. For example, if a company loosens its credit policy, it is likely that the amount of accounts receivable in relation to sales will increase. Similarly, a reduction in the number of collections personnel will likely result in an increase in the volume of delinquent accounts receivable, which will have a similar result.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0005">ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INVESTMENT</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The accounts receivable investment calculation is useful for determining the cost of maintaining a company's accounts receivable balance. By highlighting the lost interest income on accounts receivable that have not yet been collected, one can prove the need for expending additional funds on collection personnel or, alternatively, show the incremental cost of having a loose credit granting policy.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the average number of days taken by customers to pay their accounts payable (as described earlier in this chapter in the Average Receivable Collection Period section) by 365 days to determine the fraction of a year that accounts receivable are outstanding. Then multiply this figure by total annualized credit sales, which yields the dollar value of accounts receivable that is usually outstanding. Then subtract from this figure the average gross margin on products sold, which yields the average cost of goods sold that has not yet been collected. Finally, multiply this figure by the corporate cost of capital (which is described in the Cost of Capital section in Chapter 8). This results in the investment cost to the company of not collecting the cost of goods sold portion of the accounts receivable. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05007.gif" alt=" " width="471" height="45"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Unibody Plastics Company, maker of blow-molded miniature cars for children's toys, has a collections problem that is caused by the company's loose credit policy. The CFO wants to bring this issue to the president's attention by using the accounts receivable investment calculation. The current days to payment is 72 days, as opposed to 38 days before the looser credit policy was implemented. Also, the company has annual credit sales of $14,250,000, an average gross margin of 35%, and a cost of capital of 14.5%. The CFO calculates the measurement as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05008.gif" alt=" " width="402" height="63"/></p><p class="para">The CFO then runs the same calculation, but using the original 38 days to payment that was the case before the change in credit policy. The calculation is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05009.gif" alt=" " width="403" height="63"/></p><p class="para">The CFO finds that the difference between the accounts receivable investments under the two credit policy scenarios is $126,845, which is derived by subtracting the accounts receivable investment under the 38-day payment scenario from the $268,613 investment under the 72-day payment scenario. To determine whether the company has lost money by using this credit policy, the CFO should also determine the incremental increase in gross margin that was brought about by the looser credit policy. If the incremental cost of the accounts receivable investment exceeds the incremental increase in gross margin, then the CFO can make a strong case for tightening the company's credit policy.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The annual credit sales portion of the calculation may need to be adjusted to reflect the annualized amount of sales at the time of the measurement rather than the estimated amount of sales for the full year. If an estimate is used, it may vary significantly from actual sales levels (since budgeted sales figures are sometimes incorrect!).</p><p class="para">Also, the gross margin deduction may be excluded from the calculation, since it focuses attention only on the cost of capital associated with the uncollected cost of goods sold. There is a strong case that the cost of capital should be associated with the <span class="italic">full</span> amount of outstanding accounts receivable, since the company is losing interest income on any amount that is not collected.</p><p class="para">Finally, the incremental rate of investment income rather than the corporate cost of capital can be used, because this more appropriately reflects the incremental amount of income to the company that is being lost when an account receivable is not collected.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0006">ENDING RECEIVABLE BALANCE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> It is useful for working capital budgeting and cash flow forecasting purposes to have some idea of the approximate receivable balance at the end of a reporting period. This ratio yields information that is used to determine how much cash will be invested in accounts receivable at that time, which is crucial for such activities as fund-raising, investment activities, and payables planning.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of business days in the reporting period by the forecasted amount of sales in that period, which yields the average dollar volume of sales that should be shipped in each day of that period. Then multiply this daily sales amount by the average accounts receivable collection period (as calculated earlier in this chapter's Average Receivable Collection Period. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05010.gif" alt=" " width="403" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The growth of the Occam's Razor Philosophy Calculator Company, maker of the first ethical calculator, is phenomenal. The company's CFO is concerned about running out of cash, because the firm's rapid growth is requiring a great deal of cash to support its working capital needs. For the upcoming month of February, the CFO needs to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that the company will probably have on hand. The month has 28 days, the sales forecast for the period is $418,000, and the average collection period is 39 days. Based on this information, the CFO derives the following ending receivable balance:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05011.gif" alt=" " width="415" height="133"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This calculation is based on the steady flow of sales to customers over the course of a reporting period (typically a month). In reality, many companies frantically ship products to customers during the last few days of the month to empty the backlog for the first few weeks of the next month. This practice creates the month-end rush problem again in the following month. The problem also arises in services businesses, which frequently bill their customers at the end of the month, based on hours worked for the entire month. For these reasons, there tends to be a large volume of invoicing that comes due for payment in exactly one month from the end of the shipping month (because most companies pay their bills after 30 days, irrespective of actual payment terms). Consequently, it is common to see significant incoming cash flows from accounts receivable either just before or after the month-end. If these cash flows arrive just before the month-end, then the predicted level of month-end accounts receivable will be significantly off.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0007">INVENTORY TO SALES RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This calculation is used to determine the amount of inventory that is kept on hand to support a specific level of sales. It is particularly useful when tracked on a trend line, which will show if there is an increasing inventory investment in proportion to sales that may be indicative of slow-moving or obsolete inventory. It can also be used as a substitute for the inventory turnover calculation, which compares inventory to the cost of goods sold instead of sales. The inventory to sales ratio will result in a higher ratio than the inventory turnover ratio, since the comparison is to sales, which is always a larger number than the cost of goods sold.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide annualized sales by total inventory. This measure can also be subdivided into the various components of total inventory so that raw materials, work-in-process, or finished goods can be compared to sales. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05012.gif" alt=" " width="66" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The controller of the Shapiro Pool Company suspects that a series of poor purchasing decisions over the years has led to the accumulation of a large number of obsolete items in its massive inventory of pool supplies. To test this theory, the controller accumulates information for the past three years in <a id="c5-tbl-003-1" href="#c5-tbl-003">Table 5.3</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c5-tbl-003" href="#c5-tbl-003-1">TABLE 5.3</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table05003.gif" alt=" " width="564" height="106"/></p><p class="para">The ratio shows a gradual decline over the past three years, thereby proving the theory. The controller proceeds to a detailed review of inventory sales patterns for each stocked product, with the intention of either returning products to suppliers or gradually writing off the inventory.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> A seasonal business may have inventory levels that fluctuate dramatically over the course of a year, with a gradual increase in inventory up to the prime selling season, followed by a dramatic drop-off in inventory levels immediately thereafter. If this is the case, it is better to use a once-a-year measurement or compare the measurement with the results from the same month in the previous year so that the figures are reasonably comparable.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0008">INVENTORY TURNOVER</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Inventory is frequently the largest component of a company's working capital; in such situations, if inventory is not being used up by operations at a reasonable pace, then the company has invested a large part of its cash in an asset that may be difficult to liquidate in short order. Accordingly, keeping close track of the rate of inventory turnover is a significant function of management. This section describes several variations on the inventory turnover measurement, which may be combined to yield the most complete turnover reporting for management to peruse. In all cases, these measurements should be tracked on a trend line to determine whether there are gradual reductions in the rate of turnover, which can indicate to management that corrective action is required in order to eliminate excess inventory stocks.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> The most simple turnover calculation is to divide the period-end inventory into the annualized cost of sales. One can also use an average inventory figure in the denominator, which avoids sudden changes in the inventory level that are likely to occur on any specific period-end date. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05013.gif" alt=" " width="114" height="40"/></p><p class="para">A variation on the preceding formula is to divide it by 365 days, which yields the number of days of inventory on hand. This may be more understandable to the layperson; for example, the phrase <span class="italic">43 days of inventory</span> is clearer than <span class="italic">8.5 inventory turns</span>, even though they represent the same situation. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05014.gif" alt=" " width="150" height="39"/></p><p class="para">The preceding two formulas use the entire cost of goods sold in the numerator, which includes direct labor, direct materials, and overhead. However, only direct material costs directly relate to the level of raw materials inventory. Consequently, a clearer relationship is shown by comparing the value of direct materials expense to raw materials inventory, yielding a raw materials turnover figure. This measurement can also be divided into 365 days to yield the number of days of raw materials on hand. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05015.gif" alt=" " width="161" height="40"/></p><p class="para">The preceding formula does not yield as clear a relationship between direct material expense and work-in-process or finished goods, since these two categories of inventory also include cost allocations for direct labor and overhead. However, if these added costs can be stripped out of the work-in-process and finished goods valuations, then there are reasonable grounds for comparing them to the direct materials expense as a valid ratio.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Rotary Mower Company, maker of the only lawn mower driven by a Wankel rotary engine, is going through its annual management review of inventory. The information the CFO had is shown in <a id="c5-tbl-004-1" href="#c5-tbl-004">Table 5.4</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c5-tbl-004" href="#c5-tbl-004-1">TABLE 5.4</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top">Balance Sheet Line Item</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Amount</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Cost of goods sold</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$4,075,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Direct materials expense</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,550,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Raw materials inventory</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$388,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total inventory</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$815,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">To calculate total inventory turnover, the CFO creates the following calculation:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05016.gif" alt=" " width="210" height="125"/></p><p class="para">To determine the number of days of inventory on hand, the CFO divides the number of turns per year into 365 days:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05017.gif" alt=" " width="241" height="130"/></p><p class="para">The CFO is also interested in the turnover level of raw materials when compared only to direct materials expenses, using this calculation:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05018.gif" alt=" " width="370" height="89"/></p><p class="para">The next logical step for the CFO is to compare these results to those for previous years, as well as to the results achieved by other companies in the industry. One result that is probably not good in any industry is that the comparison of direct materials to raw materials inventory yielded only four turns per year. This means that the average component sits in the warehouse for 90 days before being used, which is far too long if any reliable materials-planning system is used.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The turnover ratio can be skewed by changes in the underlying costing methods used to allocate direct labor and especially overhead cost pools to the inventory. For example, if additional categories of costs are added to the overhead cost pool, then the allocation to inventory will increase, which will reduce the reported level of inventory turnover—even if the turnover level under the original calculation method has not changed. The ratio can also become skewed if the method of allocating costs is changed; for example, it may be shifted from an allocation based on labor hours to one based on machine hours, which can alter the total amount of overhead costs assigned to inventory. The problem can also arise if the inventory valuation is based on standard costs and the underlying standards are altered. In all three cases, the amount of inventory on hand has not changed, but the costing systems used have altered the reported level of inventory costs, which affects the reported level of turnover.</p><p class="para">A separate issue is that the basic inventory turnover figure may not show where the inventory overage problem is. Accordingly, the measurement can be subdivided so that there are separate calculations for raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods (perhaps subdivided further by location). This approach enables more precise management of inventory-related problems.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0009">INVENTORY TO WORKING CAPITAL RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Inventory can be a large component of working capital—so large that it skews the perception of a company's ability to raise cash from working capital, especially if the inventory has a slow rate of turnover or contains a high proportion of obsolete inventory, or both. If the proportion of inventory to working capital is consequently too high, its ability to obtain cash for short-term accounts payable requirements is questionable.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide inventory by working capital, which can be defined as current assets minus current liabilities or as accounts receivable plus inventory minus accounts payable.

Since it appears that the company's steel inventory may be difficult to liquidate in case the bank calls the loan, it elects not to grant the requested loan.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measurement should be accompanied by an inventory turnover calculation, since a company may still be relatively liquid even with a high proportion of inventory to working capital, as long as the inventory turns over so rapidly that converting it to cash is not a problem. This is an excellent measurement to track on a trend line, since a continual increase in the ratio is indicative of operating problems involving poor sales forecasting, inadequate purchasing control, or increasing levels of obsolete inventory.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0010">LIQUIDITY INDEX</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The liquidity index measures the number of days it would take to convert accounts receivable and inventory into cash. This is useful in determining a company's ability to generate sufficient cash to meet upcoming liabilities.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Multiply the accounts receivable balance by the average number of days required to liquidate it (see this chapter's Average Receivable Collection Period calculation). Then multiply the inventory balance by the average number of days required to liquidate it (which includes both the number of days to sell the inventory and the number of days to collect the resulting accounts receivable). Then add these two items together and divide them by the sum of all accounts receivable and inventory. If the accounts receivable or inventory balances tend to fluctuate significantly, an average figure can be used for both. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05020.gif" alt=" " width="484" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Doughboy Donut Company's president wants to determine the company's ability to convert its short-term assets into cash and decides to use the liquidity index to provide this information. The controller reports that the company has $382,000 of accounts receivable, which typically require 47 days to liquidate. The company also has $712,000 of inventory, which turns over six times per year. With this information, the president calculates the liquidity index as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05021.gif" alt=" " width="497" height="41"/></p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05022.gif" alt=" " width="406" height="93"/></p><p class="para">Note that the number of days to liquidate the inventory is not 60 days, as would be indicated by the six inventory turns per year, but rather 107 days, which includes the additional 47 days to collect the accounts receivable into which the inventory will be converted once it is sold. Because of the preponderance of inventory in this computation, which requires extra time to liquidate, the liquidity index is a lengthy 86 days.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The chief difficulty with the liquidity index is that it is based on average collection periods, and so does not yield a great deal of precision in regard to the exact amount of cash that will be available on a certain day. For example, if a company tends to collect the bulk of its cash on a specific date (perhaps from a single large customer), real cash flows will be largely based on the arrival of that single payment, despite the average cash flow figure revealed by the liquidity index.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0011">ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DAYS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A calculation of the days of accounts payable gives an outside observer a fair indication of a company's ability to pay its bills on time. If the accounts payable days are inordinately long, this is probably a sign that the company does not have sufficient cash flow to pay its bills and may find itself out of business in short order. Alternatively, a small number of accounts payable days indicates that a company is either taking advantage of early payment discounts or is simply paying its bills earlier than it has to.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide total annualized purchases by 365 days, and then divide the result into the ending accounts payable balance. An alternative approach is to use the average accounts payable for the reporting period because the ending figure may be disproportionately high or low. The amount of purchases should be derived from all nonpayroll expenses incurred during the year (payroll is not included because it is not a part of the accounts payable listed in the numerator). Also, depreciation and amortization should be excluded from the purchases figure since they do not involve cash payments. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05023.gif" alt=" " width="115" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Drain-Away Toilet Company has beginning accounts payable of $145,000 and ending accounts payable of $157,000. On an annualized basis, its total expenses are $2,400,000, of which $600,000 is payroll and $50,000 is depreciation. To determine its accounts payable days, we plug this information into this formula:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05024.gif" alt=" " width="403" height="42"/></p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05025.gif" alt=" " width="519" height="128"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The most difficult part of this formulation is determining the amount of annualized purchases. If a company has an irregular flow of business over the course of a year, then estimating the amount of purchases can be quite difficult. In such cases, annualizing the amount of purchases for only the past month or two will yield the most accurate comparison to the current level of accounts payable because these purchases are directly reflected within the accounts payable in the numerator.</p><p class="para">The measurement can yield inaccurate results if a company is making large additional purchases that are being capitalized into inventory or fixed assets. These purchases represent a drain on cash, yet they are not included in the formula and so can lead one to assume that a company has more liquidity than is really the case. This situation can be reversed if a company is drawing down its inventory stockpiles to make sales rather than purchasing new inventory to meet the sales requirements, which will yield greater liquidity than is indicated by the measurement.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0012">ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TURNOVER</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A slightly less sophisticated version of the accounts payable days calculation is accounts payable turnover. This variation does not yield the number of days of outstanding accounts payable but rather the number of times per year that purchases are being paid off. For example, turnover of 12 times per year is the equivalent of 30 accounts payable days while turnover of 24 times per year is the equivalent of 15 accounts payable days. Accounts payable turnover is most understandable when tracked on a trend line; an increasing turnover trend indicates more rapid payment of accounts payable while a declining trend indicates the reverse.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide total annual purchases by the ending accounts payable balance. An alternative approach is to use the average accounts payable for the reporting period, since the ending figure may be disproportionately high or low.

The sudden jump in current liabilities in the last year is particularly disturbing and is indicative of the company suddenly being unable to pay its accounts payable, which have correspondingly ballooned. The purchaser elects to reduce the offer for the company because of the likely prospect of an additional cash infusion to bring its operations onto an even keel.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measurement can be misleading if a company's current assets are heavily weighted in favor of inventories, since this current asset can be difficult to liquidate in the short term. The presence of this problem can be revealed by using the inventory to working capital ratio or the inventory turnover ratio.</p><p class="para">The current ratio can be unusually high if a company uses an aggressive cost capitalization approach when costing its inventory. In these instances, a company will add all possible costs to its cost allocation pools and then use allocation methods that tend to charge the highest possible amounts of these costs to inventory. This situation can be spotted by watching the inventory turnover level on a trend line to see if the valuation spikes and then remains at the higher level.</p><p class="para">Another problem is that the current ratio will look abnormally low for those companies that are drawing down cash from a line of credit, since they tend to keep cash balances at a minimum and only replenish their cash when it is absolutely required to pay for liabilities. In that case, a current ratio of 1:1 or less is common, even though the company's line of credit makes it unlikely that there will be a problem with the payment of liabilities.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0014">QUICK RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Because of the presence of inventory in the current ratio, which was covered in the last section, the current ratio may not be the best measure of a company's liquidity.

If a company is forced to use such financing techniques as accounts receivable factoring to pay for its ongoing operations, then the amount of its current assets will be very low. Consequently, if the ratio is extremely high, indicating the presence of few assets to support sales, a company is not only likely to have trouble filling orders (since it has an inadequate inventory), but it also may go out of business suddenly if it cannot cover its short-term accounts payable. The size of the ratio will vary considerably by industry, so a better sign of problems is a steady increase in the ratio over time, no matter what the exact ratio measurement may be.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide annualized sales by current assets.

This means that the company may fail suddenly. The auditor decides to conduct some tests to verify whether a major liquidity problem exists.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This ratio is not valid in situations in which a company is selling goods on a drop-ship arrangement with its supplier, since this means that the company records sales even though it never has possession of the goods, which are shipped directly from the supplier to the customer. Under this arrangement, a company can theoretically have no inventory at all.</p><p class="para">The ratio's results can also be suspect when a company accepts a large part of its sales with credit card payments, since this will drop accounts receivable balances to near zero, depending upon whether cash receipts are recognized at the time when a credit card sale is recorded or when cash is received from the bank supporting the customer's credit card. In both the drop-shipping and credit card situations, current assets are legitimately reduced by the type of logistical and sales operations conducted by a company and so should not be construed as being an indicator of poor liquidity.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0017">WORKING CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The working capital productivity measure is similar to the sales to current assets ratio in that both are used to determine whether there are enough assets available to support a given level of sales activity. The working capital productivity measure tends to be somewhat more accurate, since it subtracts current liabilities from current assets to arrive at a net current asset figure that may be considerably less than the total current assets figure used in the other measurement.</p><p class="para">Alternatively, an excessively low working capital productivity measurement reveals that a company is inefficient at producing sales because it has too much invested in accounts receivable or inventory, or both, to produce a given level of sales. The measure can be compared to the results of competitors to determine whether the company is using its working capital in the most effective manner.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide annual sales by total working capital. It may also be useful to calculate average working capital, in case the ending working capital for the reporting period is unusually high or low.

The lender should be concerned about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This is generally a reliable measure, but its main failing is in the derivation of the annual sales figure in the numerator. If the sales figure used here departs considerably from the annualized amount of sales within the recent past, then the ratio will not result in a good comparison of sales level to working capital requirements. There can also be a problem if the measurement is made at the end of a high seasonal sales peak, since annualized sales will appear to be quite high, but the inventory component associated with working capital will have been greatly reduced, resulting in a ratio that appears to be too high.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0018">DAYS OF WORKING CAPITAL</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A company can use a very large amount of working capital to generate a small volume of sales, which represents a poor use of assets. The inefficient asset use can lie in any part of working capital—excessive quantities of accounts receivable or inventory in relation to sales, or very small amounts of accounts payable. The days of working capital measure, when tracked on a trend line, is a good indicator of changes in the efficient use of working capital. A low number of days of working capital indicates a highly efficient use of working capital.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Add together the current balance of accounts receivable and inventory and subtract accounts payable.

There is no way to obtain a precise determination, but you can use the weighted working capital metric to measure the relative change in working capital from year to year. This involves adjusting the working capital number from the preceding year for any subsequent change in revenue (to which working capital is assumed to be tied), and subtracting the result from the current year total amount of working capital. If the result is a decrease, then this is considered an improvement, while an increase would represent a net increase in working capital in comparison to sales, which would be bad.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Multiply the previous year's net working capital by the percentage change in revenue since last year, and subtract the result from the current year's net working capital. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05036.gif" alt=" " width="480" height="34"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> The Orbison Guitar Company had net working capital of $400,000 in the preceding year, and revenues in the subsequent year increased by 8%.

The weighted working capital calculation for this period is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05037.gif" alt=" " width="460" height="35"/></p><p class="para">The calculation shows that Orbison succeeding in reducing its working capital investment in proportion to sales over a one-year period.

It can be skewed, however, by management actions that may not be good for the long-term health of the company. For example, management could have a supplier drop ship directly to its customers, thereby reducing inventory levels, but also potentially introducing suppliers to the company's customers, and allowing the suppliers entry into the market.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0020">DEFENSIVE INTERVAL RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The defensive interval ratio shows the number of days that a company can operate with its existing liquid assets, based on an expected amount of upcoming operating expenses.

Then determine the amount of expected daily operating expenses by compiling known upcoming expenses and creating a daily average expense. Finally, divide the average daily expense into the liquid assets.

The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05038.gif" alt=" " width="338" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Intrusive Burglar Alarm Company, maker of really loud alarm sirens, is short on cash. It is expecting a large payment in 40 days that will relieve its cash difficulties. In the meantime, the CFO needs to determine whether there is enough liquidity to cover short-term expense requirements. The company requires roughly $13,000 on a daily basis to cover its expenses and it has cash of $42,000, marketable securities of $119,000, and accounts receivable of $255,000.

The CFO begins calling lenders to obtain a short-term loan to cover the projected shortfall.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The amount of expected daily operating expenses used in the denominator is an average figure; the actual amount of expenses paid on a daily basis, however, is more uneven. For example, a large rent or payroll payment may be due on a specific date, although it is incorporated into the expected daily operating expense figure as a much smaller daily payment that is spread over the entire rent period. The presence of one or more of these large lump-sum payments can rapidly drain a company's cash reserves, resulting in a much lower amount of liquid assets than the measurement would otherwise indicate. To avoid this problem, one should supplement the measure with a detailed review of the exact timing of payments for upcoming accounts payable.</p><p class="para">Another problem with this measurement is that it assumes a static amount of accounts receivable. However, any business with ongoing sales will have a constant inflow of new accounts receivable, as customers are provided with goods and services. Consequently, the defensive interval ratio can be much longer than the initial calculation may indicate, as long as new accounts receivable are being generated that will be converted into cash during the time when existing liquidity is projected to cover daily expenses.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0021">CURRENT LIABILITY RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The current liability ratio is used to determine the proportion of total liabilities that are due for payment in the near term. This is only an approximate measure of liquidity, since it does not indicate the ability of a company to pay its liabilities, or whether the liabilities are extensive or small. It is consequently most useful when tracked on a trend line to determine whether a company's proportion of current liabilities to total liabilities is worsening or improving over time.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide current liabilities by total liabilities. An alternative approach is to list in the numerator only those liabilities that are due for payment within a shorter time frame, such as the next month or quarter. This approach gives a better idea of the proportion of very short-term liabilities to all liabilities. The basic formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05040.gif" alt=" " width="114" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Powder Hound Snowmobile Company's new CFO thinks that it may be time to restructure the company's debt so that more of it can be shifted out into the future. The CFO begins by reviewing the current liability ratio for the past three years to determine whether the proportion of short-term liabilities to total liabilities has increased, and accumulates the information shown in <a id="c5-tbl-0010-1" href="#c5-tbl-0010">Table 5.10</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c5-tbl-0010" href="#c5-tbl-0010-1">TABLE 5.10</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table05010.gif" alt=" " width="613" height="105"/></p><p class="para">The data reveals that the company has come to rely upon short-term debt. Consequently, the CFO elects to conduct negotiations with lenders, with the objective of converting many of these short-term liabilities into long-term ones.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As noted in the description, this ratio yields an approximate view of a company's liquidity, since it does not show the ability of the company to pay any amount of liabilities. Also, the dividing line for determining the presentation of a liability as current or not is its requirement to be paid within one year; if a liability's due date is slightly longer than one year, it will only appear in the denominator. Therefore, the one-year cutoff is an arbitrary factor that can skew the results of the measurement.</p><p class="para">Another issue is that a company may have a very high current liability ratio simply because it has paid off its long-term debt or is in its final year of debt payments (which are categorized as short-term debt). Similarly, there may be no need for any long-term debt. In both cases, the ratio appears to reveal an unwise dependence on short-term debt, when in reality the company is in good financial condition.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0022">REQUIRED CURRENT LIABILITIES TO TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A comparison of required current liabilities to total current liabilities is a good measure for determining a company's extremely short-term liability problems. If the numerator increases over time as a proportion of the total ratio, then this indicates that creditors are maintaining a close watch over payment due dates, which shows that the company is having difficulty obtaining credit that does not have extremely tight payment requirements.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total amount of all current liabilities with required payment dates by the total of all current liabilities. The amount of liabilities recorded in the numerator is subject to some degree of interpretation; for example, it may include only those liabilities coming due within the next week, or month, or quarter. Some experimentation with the ratio's results is needed to determine the exact time used and the relevance of the resulting information. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05042.gif" alt=" " width="302" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> A small fertilizer company is rapidly running out of cash. It needs to get through the next month to enter its prime spring selling season and bring in some cash. Accordingly, the controller decides to measure the proportion of current liabilities with a one-month due date or less to total current liabilities in order to gain a better understanding of how many dollars of payments are coming due. Within the one-month time frame, the company must pay $148,000, while its total current liabilities are $197,000. Using this information, the controller calculates the ratio as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05043.gif" alt=" " width="401" height="124"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This ratio does not reveal a great deal of information if measured for just a single period, since there is no way to compare it to historical information. A better approach is to measure it on a trend line, or to compare it to the same period in the preceding year, when the liability proportion should have been about the same.</p><p class="para">Also, the ratio does not reveal how much cash is actually needed for short-term payment requirements, so it should be supplemented with a short-term cash forecast that itemizes the precise cash flows to be expected over the measurement period.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0023">WORKING CAPITAL TO DEBT RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The working capital to debt ratio is used to determine whether a company could pay off its debt by liquidating its working capital. This measure is used only when debt must be paid off at once, since the elimination of all working capital makes it impossible to run a business and will likely lead to its dissolution.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Add up cash, accounts receivable, and inventory, and subtract all accounts payable from the sum. Then divide total debt into the result. A variation is to use only short-term debt in the denominator, on the grounds that only this portion of the debt will come due for payment. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05044.gif" alt=" " width="393" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The financial performance of the Open Sesame Door Company, makers of voice-activated door systems, has been so poor that it has violated all of its bank covenants. Because of the covenant violations, the bank has elected to call in its loan immediately. The bank vice president wants to know if the company can pay off the loan from its current resources and so examines the company's latest balance sheet and sees this information:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><thead><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top">Balance Sheet Line Item</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Amount</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Cash</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$20,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Accounts receivable</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$65,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Inventory</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$110,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Accounts payable</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$80,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Debt</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$185,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The vice president uses this information to calculate the working capital to debt ratio:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu05045.gif" alt=" " width="537" height="165"/></p><p class="para">The ratio shows that the bank could call the loan and receive nearly two thirds of its money back. However, a closer examination of the components of working capital reveals that current cash and receivable levels would only pay off accounts payable, leaving the loan to be paid from the much less liquid inventory balance. The company may consequently have a very difficult time paying back any of the loan. The bank vice president elects to work with company management to achieve a payback over a longer time.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As noted in the example, one component of the working capital figure that is used in the numerator is inventory, which is not nearly as liquid as cash or accounts receivable. If the proportion of inventory to working capital is high, then a company's apparent ability to pay off a debt in the short term will be exaggerated by this ratio.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0024">RISKY ASSET CONVERSION RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The risky asset conversion ratio is a useful way to determine the proportion of a company's recorded assets that are unlikely to be easily convertible into cash. This is of considerable interest to an acquirer or lender, since these entities need to understand the underlying value of the corporation in which they are investing debt or equity. The ideal ratio result should be as small as possible. If a company has a high ratio, then it not only has little liquidation value, but may also be in danger of going out of business if it must suddenly pay off a large amount of liabilities with its small proportion of concrete assets.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Summarize the cost of all assets with a minimal conversion value, net of depreciation and amortization, and divide by total assets.

In reality, there is no reason why a relatively cash-flush entity should not have put a large amount of cash in its short-term marketable securities account, which would not be counted in this ratio. To include this extra source of funds, the current assets should be netted against all current liabilities, and then any excess current liabilities included in the numerator of the ratio.</p><p class="para">Another problem with this ratio is that it assumes a lender will require a complete pay-down of its long-term debt with immediately available assets, which most companies will not have. They count instead on a continuing stream of funds from ongoing operations to pay down the debt.</p><p class="para">A third issue is that the valuation of the noncurrent assets listed in the denominator may bear little comparison to their actual resale values; for example, a company could liquidate its fixed assets and obtain far less cash from the transaction than the listed book value would indicate. Consequently, using the book value of the long-term assets to determine the amount of funding available to pay down long-term debt may not reflect a company's actual ability to pay off the debt.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0026">SHORT-TERM DEBT TO LONG-TERM DEBT RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The ratio of short-term debt to long-term debt reveals the proportion of total debt that is coming due for payment in the near term.

The loan officer decides to review the company's ability to pay off loans with great care before issuing any funds.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The ratio may not make much difference if a company has such a strong cash flow that it can easily fund any reasonable amount of short-term debt. It can also be misleading if a debt balloon payment has recently shifted from the long-term debt category to the short-term category, although a company must be making arrangements to roll forward the balloon payment if it does not expect to pay it off in the short term.</p><p class="para">One can review this measurement more appropriately by combining it with an examination of its available borrowing base. If this ratio shows a large proportion of short-term debt coming due, but there is a large amount of available borrowing base, then it is reasonable to assume that the company can obtain additional financing, up to the amount of the available borrowing base, to shift debt to the long-term category.</p><p class="h1" id="c05-sec1-0027">ALTMAN'S Z-SCORE BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION FORMULA</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The Z-score bankruptcy predictor combines five common business ratios, using a weighting system that was statistically calculated by Dr. Edward Altman to determine the likelihood of a company going bankrupt at some point in the future.

The calculation can also be used by a lender to determine the creditworthiness of a company.</p><p class="para">If the calculation results in a score above 2.99, a company is probably in safe financial condition. A score between 3.0 and 2.7 is a gray area, indicating that a company is in acceptable condition at the moment but could slide into a more difficult financial condition in the future.
