It does not address the measures for operating performance of individual departments, which are covered in Chapters 9 through 14. The measurements covered in this chapter are:</p><table class="bodytable" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Operating Assets Ratio<br/>Sales to Operating Income Ratio<br/>Sales Margin<br/>Gross Profit Percentage<br/>Gross Profit Index<br/>Investment Income Percentage<br/>Operating Profit Percentage</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Operating Leverage Ratio<br/>Net Income Percentage<br/>Core Operating Earnings<br/>Profit per Customer Visit<br/>Profit per Person<br/>Core Growth Rate<br/>Quality of Earnings Ratio</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0001">OPERATING ASSETS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This measurement is the only one in this chapter that is based solely on information in the balance sheet. It is designed for use by managers to determine which assets can be safely eliminated from a company without impairing its operational capabilities. Its intent is to focus management attention on assets that are not generating a return on investment so that they can be eliminated. </p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the dollar value of all assets used in the revenue creation process by the total amount of assets. Both of these numbers should be recorded at their gross values, prior to any depreciation deduction. The calculation can also include accounts receivable and inventory. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03001.gif" alt=" " width="189" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Matrix Motor Company has been in business since 1902 and has accumulated a large number of fixed and other assets during that time. The company has recently been acquired by a much younger company that wants to clean up shop, partly by reviewing all assets and clearing out those that are no longer needed. As a first step in this process, its acquisition team elects to calculate the operating assets ratio and then use the results to target individual assets for further action. It accumulates the information found in <a id="c3-tbl-001-1" href="#c3-tbl-001">Table 3.1</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c3-tbl-001" href="#c3-tbl-001-1">TABLE 3.1</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top">Asset Type</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Gross Value</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Current accounts receivable</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$428,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Overdue accounts receivable</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$33,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Current inventory</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$978,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Obsolete inventory</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$524,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Furniture and fixtures</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$207,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Production equipment</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$4,832,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Unused production equipment</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,403,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total assets</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$8,405,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The acquisition team elects to exclude overdue accounts receivable, obsolete inventory, and unused production equipment from the numerator in the equation, thereby focusing attention on those items as logical targets for reduction in order to make Matrix a more asset-efficient organization. The resulting calculation is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03002.gif" alt=" " width="473" height="118"/></p><p class="para">The measurement reveals that about one quarter of Matrix's assets cannot be usefully employed for revenue generation and should be evaluated for elimination.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The derivation of the asset list used for the numerator is highly subjective. Unless the measurement is backed up with a rigorous selection system to determine which assets are truly being used for productive activities, it is likely that some assets will be included in the numerator that should not be there. Also, the concept of asset usage to create revenue can create gray areas; for example, should any equipment used by the sales department be itemized as part of the revenue-creation process? The best way to deal with these issues is to create a detailed list of what asset classes should be included in the measurement, which may also require a written justification for the inclusion of specific assets in the numerator of the formula.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0002">SALES TO OPERATING INCOME RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio is useful for determining the results of operations before unrelated income or expense is added to or subtracted from a company's financial results. It is particularly noteworthy in cases where a company continually muddies the waters by adding a variety of items, such as asset sales and loss contingency reserves, that make it difficult to see how the underlying business is performing. The ratio is best used on a trend line, so that long-term changes in profitability can be readily seen and acted upon.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide operating income by net sales (reduced by investment income). Investment income, if listed as revenue, should be eliminated from the net sales figure because it relates to a company's financial activities rather than its operations. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03003.gif" alt=" " width="196" height="38"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Misses Sportswear Company, which is publicly held, bothers the investment analysts who follow its stock because it tends to report consistent earnings for a number of consecutive quarters, followed by an occasional large loss. One analyst reviews the issue by calculating the sales to operating income ratio for the company for the last few years. The results are shown in <a id="c3-tbl-002-1" href="#c3-tbl-002">Table 3.2</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c3-tbl-002" href="#c3-tbl-002-1">TABLE 3.2</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table03002.gif" alt=" " width="557" height="148"/></p><p class="para">It is evident from the table that the company is periodically creating a loss reserve, against which it will charge selected operating expense items for the next few years. Every time the reserve runs out, the company will charge off another large expense for a new reserve and then start the process again. Operational results, as shown by the sales to operating income ratio, are worsening over time, so the analyst should issue a sell recommendation on this stock.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This ratio can cause false signals that a company is having problems if the company's sales are so seasonal that the ratio reveals a loss during nonseasonal selling periods. It can also be misleading if there are several operating units, because it may show that overall results are acceptable while not revealing that some product lines within the reporting group have less stellar results. This problem can be avoided by calculating the ratio for each individual product line or business unit within a company. </p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0003">SALES MARGIN</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio clusters sales and distribution expenses with the cost of goods sold, thereby isolating all profits from a company's revenue-generating activities. It can also be viewed as the contribution margin before administrative costs are considered. It is particularly useful when calculated for individual product lines, since the cost of sales and distribution can vary significantly by product line, and thus shows the actual margins generated in these areas. It should be tracked on a trend line to see if distribution and sales costs are proportionally changing in relation to sales volume.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract sales expenses from the gross margin, and divide the result by gross sales. Sales costs should include the sales department's payroll, commissions, benefits, travel expenses, customer service, field maintenance, warranty, sales promotion, advertising, and distribution costs. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03004.gif" alt=" " width="197" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Turner Furniture Company has struggled to achieve profitability for many years. It has a gross margin of 40%, but its sales, general, and administrative costs are so large that the company has never earned more than 2% net profits. The controller decides to calculate the sales margin to determine if some additional information can be gleaned. By breaking sales costs out from other administrative costs and combining them with the gross margin, the controller finds that the sales margin drops to only 15%, leaving little room to cover other administrative costs. Further investigation reveals that the salespeople make so many trips to customer sites to finalize deals that their travel cost alone is eliminating 7% of company profits. As a result, the company switches from personalized sales to a furniture catalog, which completely eliminates travel costs and greatly increases profits.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> None. This is a very useful measurement, particularly when used to determine the profitability of products or services that are customized to some degree. Customization tends to require much more sales effort than sales of standard products, which can drastically reduce net profits.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0004">GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This is one of the most important measurements derived from the income statement. It reveals the profit left over from operations after all variable costs have been subtracted from revenues. In essence, it reveals the efficiency of the production process in relation to the prices and unit volumes at which products are sold.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> There are two ways to measure the gross margin. The most common approach is to add together the costs of overhead, direct materials, and direct labor; subtract the total from revenue; and then divide the result by revenue. This approach takes into account all costs that can be reasonably associated with the production process. </p><p class="paracontinued">The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03005.gif" alt=" " width="359" height="37"/></p><p class="para">The trouble with this approach is that many of the production costs are not truly variable. Under a much more strictly defined view of variable costs, only direct materials should be included in the formula, since this is the only cost that truly changes in proportion with changes in revenue. All other production costs are then shifted into other operational and administrative costs, which typically yield a high gross margin percentage. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03006.gif" alt=" " width="172" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Spanish Tile Company bases its sales-quoting system on the gross margin assigned to its products; prices quoted must have a gross margin of at least 25% for it to cover administrative costs and create a modest profit. The Iberian Tile Company has recently been taking business away from the Spanish Tile Company through more aggressive pricing. Investigation of its competitor's quoting practices reveals that it uses an alternative gross margin model that relies only on direct materials costs as a deduction from revenues. This means that its competitor is always in a position to offer lower prices, because it does not incorporate direct labor and overhead costs into its pricing model. The Iberian Tile Company is in danger of quoting excessively low prices if it continues to use its gross margin model, so it focuses on how prospective sales will affect its bottleneck operation, which is the tile kiln. If a prospective sale requires a great deal of kiln time, then it is charged a much higher price than other quotes that do not use as much of this valuable resource. As a result of this survey, the Spanish Tile Company realizes that its competitor has a more precise and aggressive quoting model that will likely result in more lost sales for Spanish Tile in the future. </p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As was hinted at in the example, a company can incorrectly assume that all of the costs used to calculate the gross margin are variable. This is not always true; direct materials are frequently the only completely variable costs. Consequently, changes in sales volume will generally result in a different gross margin percentage, since some of the costs vary with the sales volume and others (e.g., direct labor and overhead) are fixed.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0005">GROSS PROFIT INDEX</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio is used to detect significant changes in a company's gross profit percentage from period to period, which can be a sign of fraudulent financial reporting. If the ratio is substantially higher than 1, then there is a high risk that fraudulent reporting was used to achieve an improvement in the gross profit percentage from period to period. </p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the gross profit in period two by sales for the same period, and then divide this by the same calculation for period one. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03007.gif" alt=" " width="162" height="107"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The internal auditor of the Ultra-Kleen Carpet Company, makers of easy-to-clean throw rugs, has maintained a gross profit index calculation on a monthly basis for a number of years so that potential accounting irregularities can be spotted shortly after they arise. The gross profit, sales, gross profit percentage, and gross profit index for the past six months are noted in <a id="c3-tbl-003-1" href="#c3-tbl-003">Table 3.3</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c3-tbl-003" href="#c3-tbl-003-1">TABLE 3.3</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table03003.gif" alt=" " width="558" height="130"/></p><p class="para">The gross profit index unaccountably increased to 114% in April, which reflects a jump in the gross profit percentage from 43% to 49% from March to April. The internal auditor is not aware of any accounting or business issues that would have resulted in such a large jump; a new management incentive plan, however, was finalized at the beginning of April that rewarded managers for increasing gross profits. With this clue, the internal auditor digs deeper into the issue and eventually finds that sales have been improperly booked for many months, beginning in April, resulting in inordinately large gross margins.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This ratio is useful only if a company is in substantially the same line of business from period to period; otherwise, there can be valid, large differences in gross margins between reporting periods. For example, if a manufacturing company with 30% gross margins were to purchase a software company with 95% gross margins, the gross profit index would vary enormously, but be entirely valid.</p><p class="para">Also, be sure to use the same accounting methodologies in both periods being reviewed so that the results are not skewed. For example, a change in the allocation method for overhead costs between periods would alter the gross margin to such an extent that the periods would not be comparable.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0006">INVESTMENT INCOME PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This measure is used to determine the effectiveness of a company's investment activities. However, review the Cautions section in regard to how this measure can skew a company's investment objectives.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Add together all dividend income and interest income for the period, and divide it by the carrying value of all investments. The dividend and interest income should be recorded on the accrual basis, since there may be timing differences in the receipt of funds that would otherwise shift the income to some future period and skew the resulting measurement. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03008.gif" alt=" " width="229" height="40"/></p><p class="para">It may also be possible to include in the calculation the change in value of investments in other companies under the equity method of accounting, whereby the investing entity records an increase in income based on its proportionate share of the income recorded by the investee. However, this entry does not necessarily correspond to an actual cash payment to the investor, either at the time of the entry or at any point in the future, and for that reason may be excluded from the calculation.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Curious Coin Company, purveyors of coins recovered from sunken ships, invests its excess funds in a variety of investments. The CFO would like to determine the average investment income percentage from these investments. The relevant information is shown in <a id="c3-tbl-004-1" href="#c3-tbl-004">Table 3.4</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c3-tbl-004" href="#c3-tbl-004-1">TABLE 3.4</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top">Type of Investment</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Amount of Investment</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Rate of Return</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Money market</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,300,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2.5%</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">U.S. Treasury bills</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$500,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">4.2%</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Bonds</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$2,700,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">7.5%</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Common stock</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$4,175,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">12.8%</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Totals</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$8,675,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">9.1%</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The CFO must retain a large proportion of the funds in short-term, liquid accounts in case the company needs money to purchase recovered coins on short notice. All other funds are invested on a long-term basis with a balanced goal of modest risk and return. Based on company goals, the CFO decides that an average investment income percentage of 9.1% is reasonable.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The primary problem with the investment income percentage is that it can drive investment officers to engage in highly risky investment activities in order to achieve the highest possible levels of return on investment. In reality, most companies reserve some portion of their available funds for extremely safe and liquid investments that yield low returns. Even in cases where funds can be invested for the long term, the types of investments should be restricted to those that carry modest to low levels of investment risk so that a company will not experience unexpected losses through its investment activities. To ensure that the use of this measurement does not result in improper investments, it should be coupled with an ongoing review of the risk ratings of the investments. Another possibility is to alter the measurement so that it is a comparison of the rate of return achieved and the average rate of return for the class of investments in which activities are allowed; any improvement over the average rate of return can then be considered a reasonable return on investment.</p><p class="para">A separate issue is that companies may invest some excess funds in whole life insurance policies, which can have significant cash surrender values. If the cash surrender values can be readily ascertained, the return on these investments should also be calculated, net of the cost of term life insurance that is included in them.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0007">OPERATING PROFIT PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The operating profit percentage reveals the return from standard operations, excluding the impact of extraordinary items and other comprehensive income. This percentage reveals the extent to which a company is earning a profit from standard operations, as opposed to resorting to asset sales or unique transactions to post a profit.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the cost of goods sold, as well as all sales, general, and administrative expenses, from sales. To obtain a percentage that is related strictly to operational results, be sure to exclude interest income and expense from the calculation, since these items are related to a company's financing decisions rather than its operational characteristics. Expense totals used in the ratio should exclude all extraordinary transactions, as well as asset dispositions, since they do not relate to continuing operations. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03009.gif" alt=" " width="467" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Swiss Mountain Chocolate Company has a loan with the local bank whose covenants include the stipulation that the loan will be immediately callable if the company's operating profit percentage drops below zero. In the current month, it will incur an operating loss of $15,000, which will allow the bank to call in its loan. The calculation it is using to derive the operating loss is:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Revenue</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,428,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Cost of goods sold</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">–571,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Gross margin</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">857,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Operating costs</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">849,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Interest expense</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">23,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Operating profit/loss</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">–$15,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Operating profit percentage</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">–1%</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">Since there is no specification in the loan agreement of the operating loss calculation, the controller defines it as excluding financing activities and removes the interest expense from the calculation, which then yields an operating profit of $8,000. To be ethically correct, the controller also specifies the exact contents of the calculation in his next report to the bank.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> An organization that is not experiencing acceptable operational results will seek to bolster revenues and artificially reduce expenses in order to make this ratio look better than it really is. Examples of possible methods for altering this ratio are incorrect capitalization of expenses, recording expenses in the wrong accounting periods, and inaccurately valuing inventories. Revenues may also be increased by a variety of techniques, such as pulling sales into an accounting period that should have been recognized in the following period, as well as recording unshipped products as sales. The number of methods for falsely enhancing this ratio is enormous.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0008">OPERATING LEVERAGE RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio reveals the extent to which fixed costs are required to create profits, by comparing the amount of fixed costs to operating income. It is particularly useful when a company is considering the acquisition of more fixed assets to replace variable costs, such as manual labor in the production process, and wants to find out the extent to which this will add to its fixed cost structure. This ratio works well when combined with break-even analysis, which is heavily influenced by changes in fixed costs.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract all variable expenses from sales and then divide this amount by operating income. Under the most strict definition of variable expenses, this will likely include only direct materials costs and commissions; all other expenses are fixed in the short run and can be included in the ratio as fixed costs. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03010.gif" alt=" " width="162" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Wide Wallet Company, maker of fine wallets to be sold in countries issuing large banknotes, is considering the services of an outsourcing company to sew its wallets, thus dispensing with a number of personnel on its production line. The before-and-after cost structure of this decision is shown in <a id="c3-tbl-005-1" href="#c3-tbl-005">Table 3.5</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c3-tbl-005" href="#c3-tbl-005-1">TABLE 3.5</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Before Outsourcing</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">After Outsourcing</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sales</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$3,750,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$3,750,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Fixed outsourcing fee</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$0</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$580,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Direct labor cost</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,450,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$850,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Direct materials</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$800,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$800,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Operating income</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$150,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$170,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Operating leverage ratio</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">10:1</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">12:1</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The company staffs the direct labor positions each day in direct proportion to the amount of work available, so direct labor can be considered a valid variable cost. The outsourcing contract has a minimum fixed cost of $580,000, which can be increased if production levels exceed a contractually set minimum level. Upon investigation of the numbers in the table, the company's financial analyst realizes that the proposed deal will replace variable labor costs with a fixed cost that will only contribute $20,000 to the company's profit level and will worsen its ratio of fixed costs to operating profits from 10:1 to 12:1. Consequently, the proposed deal is dropped.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Be careful to examine all costs used in the numerator of the ratio, and include them as fixed costs when in doubt as to their fixed or variable nature. Though all costs are variable in the long term, most are hard to change in the short term and so should be itemized as fixed costs. Even the wages paid to direct labor personnel are usually not variable, since most companies do not vary their direct labor staffing levels unless there are marked changes in the level of production.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0009">NET INCOME PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This percentage is used to determine the proportion of income derived from all operating, financing, and other activities that an entity has engaged in during an accounting period. This figure is the one most commonly used as a benchmark for determining a company's performance, even though it can be significantly misrepresented by the accounting department, as noted in the Cautions section below.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide net income by revenue. If this percentage is being tracked on a trend line, it may be useful to eliminate from the calculation any extraordinary income items, such as losses from disasters, since they do not yield comparable period-to-period information. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03011.gif" alt=" " width="75" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Quick Cuts Hair Salon is a franchise operation that pays for the initial fixed assets required by each franchisee. This involves an investment of about $200,000 per hair salon. The management team is determined to grow the operation as fast as possible while still reporting healthy profits. To do so, it sets the capitalization limit very low, at just $250, so that nearly everything it purchases is capitalized. Because it uses a 10-year depreciation period for all fixed assets, this results in the recognition of costs over many future periods that would normally be recognized at once if a higher capitalization limit were used. Its operating results for a typical store are shown in <a id="c3-tbl-006-1" href="#c3-tbl-006">Table 3.6</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c3-tbl-006" href="#c3-tbl-006-1">TABLE 3.6</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Per-Store Results</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sales</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$350,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Wages</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$260,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Supplies</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$75,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Assets &lt; $1,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$42,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Net income</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$15,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Net income percentage</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">4%</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The key line item in the table is the assets costing less than $1,000; if the company had set a higher capitalization limit, these costs would have been recognized as expenses at once, which would have yielded a loss on operations of $27,000 per store. As a result, the company's accounting policy is creating false profits. When combined with the high initial setup cost of each store, it is apparent that this seemingly healthy franchise operation is actually burning through its cash reserves at a prodigious rate.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The net income figure is frequently taken as representing a company's operational performance even though it can be warped by the inclusion of interest income and expense (which are financing activities) and the inclusion of gains and losses from nonoperating activities. It is also possible to reveal a positive net income figure when a company is experiencing a major cash drain by means such as aggressive capitalization of costs incurred and the early recognition of revenue. Consequently, an initially favorable opinion of a company's performance from reviewing this percentage should be bolstered by the examination of other measures to ensure that it has indeed had favorable financial results.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0010">CORE OPERATING EARNINGS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> GAAP allows company managers to use a variety of legitimate accounting techniques to mask true operating results. In an effort to improve the clearness of financial reporting, Standard &amp; Poor's has created a measure called core operating earnings (COE), which includes or excludes certain accounting items from a company's reported earnings so as to derive a more accurate view of its true operating results.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Given the number of additions to and subtractions from GAAP earnings that are involved in COE, it is easiest to show S&amp;P's modifications in the following tabular format:</p><div class="list"><p class="listunmarked">+ Employee stock option expenses </p><p class="listunmarked">+ Restructuring charges from ongoing operations </p><p class="listunmarked">+ Pension fund costs </p><p class="listunmarked">+ Purchased R&amp;D expenses </p><p class="listunmarked">+ Asset write-downs </p><p class="listunmarked">– Goodwill impairment charges </p><p class="listunmarked">– Gains and losses from the sale of assets </p><p class="listunmarked">– Pension gains </p><p class="listunmarked">– Merger and acquisition–related expenses </p><p class="listunmarked">– Litigation and insurance settlement costs and proceeds </p><p class="listunmarked">– Unrealized gains from hedging activities</p></div><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The conglomerate GlobCo has reported GAAP-based earnings of $45,000,000.

Another problem is that COE includes losses on pension fund investments. Since the pension fund has nothing to do with core operations, COE should not include this item.</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">$45,000,000</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Net earnings</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">+</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Already included</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Employee stock option expenses</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">+</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Already included</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Restructuring charges from ongoing operations</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">+</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Already included</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Pension fund costs</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">+</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Already included</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Purchased R&amp;D expenses</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">+</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Already included</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Asset write-downs</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">–</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">(2,500,000)</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Goodwill impairment charges (expense reversal)</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">–</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">(1,000,000)</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Losses from the sale of assets (expense reversal)</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">–</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">650,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Pension gains (gain reversal)</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">–</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">(3,250,000)</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Merger and acquisition–related expenses (expense reversal)</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">–</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">150,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Litigation proceeds (gain reversal)</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">–</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">175,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Unrealized gains from hedging activities (gain reversal)</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">=</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$50,775,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Core operating earnings</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">Stock analysts are more interested in prospects for future earnings, and so are less likely to use the COE measurement except to verify results reported by management.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0011">PROFIT PER CUSTOMER VISIT</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Retail establishments that focus on customer convenience can have a major problem with the standard metric of profits per store, because the easiest way to improve the metric is to reduce the number of stores or shift to low-rent locations. Certainly neither approach results in enhanced customer convenience! A better metric for this type of business is profit per customer visit, which eliminates the focus on cutting the cost of the store, and instead puts the emphasis on improving the customer experience. This metric tends to result in higher investments in both more and better store locations, thereby enhancing the focus on customer convenience.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide total profits by the number of customer visits. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03012.gif" alt=" " width="135" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Tacos Mexicana operates 500 taco fast-food outlets. It has previously been governed by a profit-per-store metric, which has steadily declined over time as the company has reduced the cost per store by consolidating locations and shifting the remaining outlets to low-rent areas. Tacos's new president adopts the strategy of selling from a smaller menu, using thousands of portable food kiosks instead of the existing outlets. To focus the corporation on this new strategy, she shifts the key metric to profit per customer visit. The before-and-after results of this strategy are as follows:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03013.gif" alt=" " width="500" height="63"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This metric only works when profits are truly derived from an emphasis on customer convenience, since this metric will result in significant expenses to service customers. If customers are not willing to pay for convenience, then using this metric may yield contrary financial results.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0012">PROFIT PER PERSON</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This measure is useful for those enterprises with a high proportion of personnel costs to other costs, such as consulting or other service businesses, in which changes in the efficiency of the staff have a direct impact on the profitability of the overall corporation. It is least useful in highly automated entities in which the proportion of labor costs to total costs is quite small. This is a more comprehensive measure than sales per person (which was described in Chapter 2), since it accounts for not only the ability of the staff to bring in sales but also their ability to wring a profit from those sales.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide net profit by the total number of full-time equivalents. This measure is more reliable when net profit from operations is used instead of total net profit, since this concentrates attention on actual operating results, rather than other actions that may affect profits. A full-time equivalent (FTE) is the combination of staffing that equals a 40-hour week. For example, two half-time employees would be counted as one FTE. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03014.gif" alt=" " width="171" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Durable Blu-Ray Company's president is considering a new bonus plan for the management team that is based on the number of personnel in relation to profits. Because salaries and wages are such a large component of expenses, the president considers this to be a key performance measure. Some managers will attempt to incorrectly enhance their reported performance under this measure, so the president derives a formula that converts the cost of part-time staff, outsourced services, and services from temporary agencies into FTE. The components are:</p><ul class="list"><li class="listbulleted">Each salaried person equals one FTE.</li><li class="listbulleted">The total of all hours recorded in the payroll system per month divided by 160 hours equals the number of FTEs on hourly pay.</li><li class="listbulleted">The total number of hours billed by temporary agencies per month divided by 160 hours equals the number of FTEs from outside agencies.</li><li class="listbulleted">The total billings from outsourcing services per month divided by the hourly cost of equivalent positions within the company or industry equals the total number of FTEs from outsourced functions.</li></ul><p class="para">This comprehensive formula, when used to plot profit per person on a trend line, allows the president to determine which managers are truly improving the efficiency of their departments and not just attempting to hide the number of personnel reporting to them.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> In a very-low-profit situation, this ratio is so small that it yields no relevant information. Also, managers can manipulate this number by shifting to outsourcing services or temporary labor services, thereby effectively moving headcount out of the company, although costs are still incurred from outsourcing billings.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0013">CORE GROWTH RATE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Companies regularly trumpet their ability to increase revenues year after year. But how much of that growth is due to acquisitions, accounting changes, or product price increases? By stripping out these forms of manufactured revenue, it is much easier to see if a company's core operations are actually growing, and by how much.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the annual revenue from five years ago from the current annual revenue, as well as revenue from acquisitions at the point of acquisition and any revenue changes arising from altered revenue recognition policies. Divide the result by the annual revenue from five years ago, divide this result by five to annualize it, and then subtract the company's average annual price increase over the five-year measurement period. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03015.gif" alt=" " width="493" height="94"/></p><p class="para">If information about the company's average annual price increase is not available, then consider using the change in price of the underlying commodity or industry segment, as measured by either the Consumer Price Index or the Product Price Index.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The president of the Premier Concrete Group (PCG) has recently claimed that the company has experienced average annual compounded growth of 12%. An outside analyst wants to verify this claim by calculating PCG's core growth rate. PCG's current revenue is $88 million, and its revenue five years ago was $50 million. During that period, PCG acquired companies with a total of $27 million in revenues when they were acquired. Also, PCG benefited from altered revenue recognition policies that increased its revenue by $5 million. The analyst also learns that the concrete industry's average annual price increase during the measurement period was 2%. The analyst determines PCG's core growth rate with the following calculation:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03016.gif" alt=" " width="489" height="137"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The information used in this formula can be difficult to obtain, and may involve the use of approximations, especially for the determination of changes caused by revenue recognition policies and the determination of an average annual price increase. Consequently, the results should be considered approximations of the actual core growth rate.</p><p class="h1" id="c03-sec1-0014">QUALITY OF EARNINGS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> It can be extremely difficult for an outsider, such as a stock analyst, bank officer, or investor, to determine if the earnings reported by a company are based on a foundation of solid operational earnings or if the company is taking advantage of a broad array of accounting tricks that are allowable under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to artificially bolster its earnings. A simple ratio for determining the quality of reported earnings is the quality of earnings ratio. This measurement essentially compares the reported earnings level to the reported cash flow from operations. If the numbers are close, then the reported earnings number probably fairly reflects actual results.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract cash from operations from net earnings, and divide the result by average total assets. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03017.gif" alt=" " width="242" height="40"/></p><p class="para">The percentage resulting from this formula should be very low, with a number close to zero indicating a high quality of earnings. Any number higher than 6% indicates a low quality of earnings.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Bonzo Pranks Company, operator of a chain of publicly held joke shops, has issued annual financial statements showing earnings of $20 million and cash flow from operations of $4 million. The total assets it reports at the beginning of the year are $94 million, and $106 million at the end of the year. Its quality of earnings ratio is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/ueqn03018.gif" alt=" " width="408" height="38"/></p><p class="para">Bonzo appears to be playing a prank on its investors! Bonzo's earnings are much higher than its cash from operations, resulting in an inordinately high quality of earnings ratio.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Even if the ratio appears to indicate considerable divergence between cash flow and earnings, there may be a good reason for the change. If cash flow from operations is persistently well below the level of reported earnings, however, then some degree of accounting trickery is likely to be the cause. </p></div></div>
