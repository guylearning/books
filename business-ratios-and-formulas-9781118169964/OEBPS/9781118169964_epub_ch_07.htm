These measures encompass net worth, several types of return on assets and equity, earnings per share, economic value added, and return on dividends. They can be used by investors to determine what to pay for a company's shares as well as to measure the return on investment. Company management can use these measures to determine its ability to generate a reasonable rate of return. The measures discussed in this chapter are:</p><table class="bodytable" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Net Worth<br/>Book Value per Share<br/>Tangible Book Value<br/>Return on Assets Employed<br/>Return on Infrastructure Employed<br/>Return on Operating Assets<br/>Return on Equity Percentage<br/>Return on Common Equity<br/>Financial Leverage Index</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Equity Growth Rate<br/>Earnings per Share<br/>Percentage Change in Earnings per Share<br/>Economic Value Added<br/>EVA Momentum<br/>Relative Value of Growth<br/>Dividend Payout Ratio<br/>Dividend Yield Ratio</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="h1" id="c07-sec1-0001">NET WORTH</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A company's net worth is the amount of money that is left over after all of its liabilities have been deducted from its assets. This is theoretically the amount of funds that would be left over for distribution to investors if a company were to be liquidated. A negative net worth is a reasonable indicator of serious fiscal problems. This measure is sometimes used by lenders, who may require that a minimum net worth be maintained for a loan to be left outstanding.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> In its simplest form, the net worth calculation is found by subtracting total liabilities from total assets. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07001.gif" alt=" " width="185" height="11"/></p><p class="para">A more detailed version of the measurement is found by subtracting any preferred stock dividends from total assets; dividends may be listed only alongside the balance sheet as a footnote and so would not otherwise be included in the calculation. In essence, every obligation of the company to make a payment, whether it be included on the balance sheet as a liability or not, should be subtracted from total assets to help arrive at a company's net worth. The revised calculation is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07002.gif" alt=" " width="361" height="11"/></p><p class="para">Investors may be interested in the net worth calculation on a per-share basis. If so, the preceding calculation can be divided by the total amount of outstanding common shares. A variation on this approach is to expand the number of outstanding common shares to include the potential addition of shares due to outstanding options, warrants, and convertible bonds. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07003.gif" alt=" " width="361" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Bottomless Bathtub Company, maker of fine porcelain tubs, has obtained a $2,000,000 loan from the First Federal Bank to cover the cost of a facility expansion. One condition of the loan is that the company's net worth at the end of each quarterly reporting period does not drop below $500,000. The controller is reviewing the balance sheet for February, which is one month before its quarterly report to the bank. The balance sheet is:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Cash and receivables</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$475,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Inventory</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">800,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Fixed assets</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">4,305,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total assets</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$5,580,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Accounts payable</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">590,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Loans outstanding</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">4,500,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total liabilities</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$5,090,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Stockholders' equity</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">490,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total liabilities and equity</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$5,580,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The company's net worth is currently $490,000, which is derived as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07004.gif" alt=" " width="451" height="14"/></p><p class="para">The company needs to increase its net worth by $10,000 by the end of the following month so that the quarterly report to the bank will still meet the minimum net worth requirement. The controller knows that March is expected to be a break-even month, so liabilities will not be reduced. Accordingly, the controller recommends to the CFO either an investment of $10,000 in equity that would be used to reduce the loan balance (or increase cash), or an immediate layoff that will reduce liabilities in the short run.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The primary difficulty with the net worth measurement is that it is based on historical valuations that may have little basis in present market conditions. For example, if a company has a production line that is composed of several custom-built machines, there may be no resale market for the machines, rendering them valueless in the event of a corporate liquidation. Similarly, if a company holds title to a valuable patent, only the capitalized legal costs associated with the patent will appear as an asset, even though the value of the patent itself may be much higher. Also, the value of brand names is not noted in the balance sheet. For these reasons, detailed knowledge of a company's individual assets and liabilities is a better tool for determining net worth than the simple calculation presented here, which is based on historical accounting information.</p><p class="h1" id="c07-sec1-0002">BOOK VALUE PER SHARE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The book value per share measurement is used by investors and analysts to determine whether the market price of a share is in excess of or less than its book value. A higher market price indicates that investors have assigned extra value to a company, perhaps due to excellent management, products, patents, and so on. This measurement can also be used to determine the same information for subsets of stock, such as preferred stock.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Determine the amount of the payout needed to liquidate all preferred stock, which may include not only the payback of the original stock purchase price but also a preferential return and accumulated but unpaid dividends. Then subtract this amount from total equity (paid-in capital, the par value of stock, and retained earnings), and divide the remainder by the total number of common shares outstanding. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07005.gif" alt=" " width="296" height="40"/></p><p class="para">This measure can also be targeted at specific types of stock. The following formula shows the calculation for the book value per share of preferred stock:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07006.gif" alt=" " width="417" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> An investment analyst is reviewing the stock price of the Beta Test Company, a provider of software testing services. The current market price of its common stock is $14.18, and there are 2,450,000 shares outstanding. The analyst wants to find out how this price varies from the firm's book value, given the following information:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Preferred payback on preferred stock</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,278,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Unpaid preferred dividends</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">510,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Additional paid-in capital</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">24,500,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Par value of common stock</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">245,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Retained earnings</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">3,005,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">Based on this information, the book value per share is calculated, using the formula:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07007.gif" alt=" " width="408" height="212"/></p><p class="para">Since the market value of the stock is currently 34% higher than the book value per share, the analyst concludes that investors are pleased with this company's performance. For verification of this view, she can also compare the premiums over book value per share of the company with those of the company's competitors.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Companies that have found themselves in difficult financial situations may have been forced to strike deals with investors that essentially shift the bulk of the liquidation value of the firm to them in exchange for an investment in some category of preferred stock. If this appears to be the case, be sure to examine closely the preferred stock documents to ascertain all special payments to be made to these investors.</p><p class="h1" id="c07-sec1-0003">TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A company's book value can be significantly inflated through the acquisition process, since the excess amount of an acquiree's purchase price over the market value of its assets can be recorded in a goodwill asset account. Many shareholders are uncomfortable with the goodwill concept, since it does not translate into a discernible asset that would be available to shareholders in the event of a liquidation. Accordingly, the tangible book value measurement can be used to strip the value of goodwill and other intangibles from a company's book value.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Add together the recorded cost of goodwill and all other intangible assets, and subtract this amount from a company's book value. The amount of all intangibles used in the calculation should be net of any amortization and valuation write-downs. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07008.gif" alt=" " width="281" height="14"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Book Rack Company has gone on an acquisition binge, purchasing a number of retail booksellers. All of the purchases involved prices well above the fair market value of the assets bought, resulting in substantial increases in the Book Rack's goodwill account. Its shareholders are concerned about the value added to the company by these transactions, and decide to calculate the tangible book value measurement to see how much the company is worth after intangibles are removed. The company's book value is $43,800,000, the total goodwill on its books is $29,300,000, and the capitalized legal costs associated with its trademarks is $439,000. Based on this information, the company's tangible net worth is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07009.gif" alt=" " width="339" height="92"/></p><p class="para">The shareholders' concerns may be well founded, since 68% of the company's book value comprises intangible assets.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measure can focus too exclusively on tangible assets, since there may be extremely valuable intangible assets on the books, such as patents or brands. If so, specific intangible assets can be added back into the measurement at the user's discretion. If this approach is used, it would be useful to itemize in a footnote the specific intangibles that were added back, as well as the cost assigned to them.</p><p class="h1" id="c07-sec1-0004">RETURN ON ASSETS EMPLOYED</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A company is deemed efficient by investors if it can generate an adequate return while using the minimum amount of assets to do so. This also keeps investors from having to put more cash into the company and allows the company to shift its excess cash to investments in new endeavors. Consequently, the return-on-assets-employed measure is considered a critical one for determining a company's overall level of operating efficiency.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide net profits by total assets. Although the assets figure is sometimes restricted to just fixed assets, it should include accounts receivable and inventory, since these areas can be major users of cash. The amount of fixed assets included in the denominator is typically net of depreciation; it can also be recorded at its gross value, as long as the formula derivation is used consistently over multiple periods, thereby ensuring consistent long-term reporting. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07010.gif" alt=" " width="79" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Mr. Willston is the new owner of Southern Sheet Metal, a metal stamping company. He purchased the company for $3 million, and wants to retrieve as much of these funds as possible by increasing the company's return on assets. He has the controller collect the information about company income and assets that is shown in <a id="c7-tbl-001-1" href="#c7-tbl-001">Table 7.1</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c7-tbl-001" href="#c7-tbl-001-1">TABLE 7.1</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Year-end Results</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Days on Hand</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sales</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$3,070,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top"></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Net income</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$215,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">—</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Accounts receivable</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$512,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">60</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Inventory</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$461,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">90</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Fixed assets</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,950,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">—</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total assets</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$2,923,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">—</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">Based on the table, the calculation of net assets employed is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07011.gif" alt=" " width="97" height="133"/></p><p class="para">As the new owner, Mr. Willston is not certain which of the fixed assets can be safely eliminated while maintaining productive capacity. However, he is sure that the days of accounts receivable and inventory, as noted in the table, are much too high. Accordingly, he improves collection activities and early payment discounts and drops the outstanding accounts receivable balance from 60 days to 45, reducing this asset to $384,000. He also installs an improved inventory management system, reducing the on-hand inventory balance from 90 to 60 days, which reduces this asset to $309,000. By taking these actions, he has eliminated $280,000 of assets, which he can take out of the business. He has also improved the net assets employed measurement to 8.1%, which is calculated as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07012.gif" alt=" " width="219" height="100"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measurement is of no use in cases in which there are minimal profits, since the ratio can fluctuate considerably on a percentage basis with slight changes in the level of profit. Of more concern is the historical basis of accounting that is used to derive the value of total assets. Although the value of short-term assets such as accounts receivable is probably quite accurate, this may not be the case for facilities and equipment that were obtained many years ago. To obtain a more accurate determination of this measure, one should consider conducting an appraisal of major assets and using this value in place of their historical cost.</p><p class="h1" id="c07-sec1-0005">RETURN ON INFRASTRUCTURE EMPLOYED</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Investments in information technology (IT) tend to be a black hole for many companies—significant funding is supplied, but there is no way to determine if a return was generated from the investment. In many situations, a business case is created for each major IT investment, but once the project is installed, it becomes extremely difficult to separate out specific, quantifiable benefits from the clutter of accounting information associated with other investment initiatives. A more aggregate metric that lumps all IT spending together and compares it to total earnings is the return on infrastructure employed (ROIE). Though there are issues with this approach (see the Cautions section), ROIE can provide a general indicator of the effectiveness of IT expenditures.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide before-tax earnings by the total corporate-wide IT expense, which includes all IT expenses (such as IT salaries, purchased software and hardware, internally developed software, networking, and outsourcing expenses). The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07013.gif" alt=" " width="286" height="40"/></p><p class="para">Taxes are excluded from this measure, since the IT department has no control over the incremental corporate tax rate.</p><p class="para">This measure is best tracked on a trend line to see how incremental changes in IT expenditures affect earnings over time.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Interactive Audio, a producer of audio recording equipment, has made a series of IT investments in such areas as on-line customer comment areas, automatic downloading of equipment error conditions, and a knowledge base for the customer service staff. <a id="c7-tbl-002-1" href="#c7-tbl-002">Table 7.2</a> indicates the results of this effort.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c7-tbl-002" href="#c7-tbl-002-1">TABLE 7.2</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table07002.gif" alt=" " width="559" height="88"/></p><p class="para">Based on the ROIE information in the table, it is possible that Interactive's IT investments have resulted in an incremental improvement in earnings, though other non-IT factors could be affecting the earnings figure.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measure assumes there is a causal relationship between IT spending and net earnings, which may not be the case. Net earnings are also affected by the business cycle, changes in marketing expenditures, new product releases, and a plethora of other factors.</p><p class="para">Additionally, the denominator of this measure can be significantly impacted by changes in the assumed number of years over which capitalized IT investments are amortized, by shifting expenses to IT outsourcing companies, or simply by withholding funds from IT projects that will benefit a company over the long term. </p><p class="h1" id="c07-sec1-0006">RETURN ON OPERATING ASSETS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This measure varies somewhat from return on assets employed because only those assets actively used to create revenue are used in the denominator. This focuses management attention on the value of assets actually required to run the business, so it has a theoretical targeted asset level to achieve. A typical result of this measurement is an ongoing campaign to eliminate unnecessary assets.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide net income by the gross valuation of all assets used to create revenue. An asset valuation that is net of depreciation can also be used, but the type of depreciation calculation can skew the net amount significantly, since some accelerated depreciation methods eliminate as much as 40% of an asset's value in its first full year of usage. Also, if a significant proportion of net income comprises income or losses due to extraordinary items that have nothing to do with ongoing revenue creation, then the impact of these items should be eliminated from net income for the purposes of the calculation. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07014.gif" alt=" " width="192" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Quality Cabinets, an old maker of fine mahogany cabinets, has accumulated several pieces of equipment over the years that are only occasionally used in the production process. The new CFO suspects that there is considerable equipment redundancy and some degree of protectiveness by the staff of the older pieces of equipment, some of which are old enough to have value as antiques (the equipment, not the staff). The company had income of $230,000 in the last year. The CFO accumulates the following information about its fixed assets:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total asset base</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$700,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Band saws required for maximum capacity</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">4</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total band saws available</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">7</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Average band saw cost</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$15,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Belt sanders required for maximum capacity</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">3</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total belt sanders available</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">8</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Average belt sander cost</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$8,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">By avoiding the opinions of the production staff and relying instead on a quantitative comparison of capacity levels and available equipment, the CFO has determined that there are three extra band saws and five extra belt sanders, with a combined cost of $85,000. With this information, the CFO calculates the return on operating assets as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07015.gif" alt=" " width="362" height="124"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The specific assets included in the denominator can be subject to a great deal of interpretation, since managers realize that any assets not included in it will eventually become targets for elimination. The list of assets used should consequently be carefully reviewed, preferably with the industrial engineering staff, to ensure that each asset has a direct role in the production of revenue.</p><p class="h1" id="c07-sec1-0007">RETURN ON EQUITY PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This calculation is used by investors to determine the amount of return they are receiving from their capital investment in a company. This is a commonly used measure, but can be misleading, as discussed in the Cautions section.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide net income by total equity. To obtain a better picture of the ability of a company to generate a return from operating activities only, the measure can be modified to be net income from operations divided by total equity. The basic formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07016.gif" alt=" " width="82" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The president of the Lounger Chairs Furniture Company has been provided with a bonus plan that is largely based on the increase achieved on return on equity for the shareholders. There is $1,000,000 of equity on the books, of which $400,000 is closely held and the other $600,000 is held by a variety of small investors. The president estimates that it will be possible to buy back $300,000 of the stock from small investors by obtaining a loan that has an after-tax interest rate of 8%. The president compiles the information in <a id="c7-tbl-003-1" href="#c7-tbl-003">Table 7.3</a> to see if the stratagem makes sense.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c7-tbl-003" href="#c7-tbl-003-1">TABLE 7.3</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="headercell" valign="top"></td><td class="headercell" valign="top">Before Stock Buyback</td><td class="headercell" valign="top">After Stock Buyback</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Sales</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$5,000,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$5,000,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Expenses</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$4,850,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$4,850,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Debt interest expense</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">—</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$24,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Profits</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$150,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$126,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Equity</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$1,000,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$700,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Return on equity</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">15%</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">18%</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The strategy appears to be a good one. Though expenses will be driven up by the interest cost of the debt, the amount of equity will be reduced to such an extent that the return on equity will increase by 3%. Before implementing this strategy, though, the president should investigate the company's ability to generate enough cash flow to pay off or at least maintain the debt.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> A management team that is eager to increase a company's return on equity can easily do so by incurring new debt and using these funds to buy back stock. Although the amount of equity is thereby reduced, making the ratio more favorable, the company also has an obligation to pay back the debt and related interest. An overly zealous pursuit of this approach can result in such a large debt load that a small downturn in sales will not allow it to pay off the debt, possibly ending in bankruptcy. An astute investor should combine this ratio with an analysis of how much debt a company has incurred, as well as its interest cost.</p><p class="h1" id="c07-sec1-0008">RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A variation on the last measurement (return on equity percentage) is return on common equity. The calculation is the same one used for return on equity, except that preferred stock dividends are removed from the net income listed in the numerator, whereas only common stockholders' equity is used in the denominator. Thus a more accurate estimate is obtained of the return to common shareholders, excluding the returns to the holders of all other types of stock. This is useful in situations in which stock has been issued that yields large dividends or preferential returns, so that common shareholders can see the minimized amount of return left for them.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract any preferred stock dividends from net income, and divide the result by common stockholders' equity. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07017.gif" alt=" " width="251" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Premium Data Corporation, a provider of databases to the military, finds itself in difficult financial circumstances and must issue a round of Series A preferred stock to a new group of investors to help bring in more cash. The original owners of the firm's common stock would like to see how their return has been diminished by this transaction, and they calculate the return on common equity to find out. The new Series A stock includes a provision for a mandatory $3.50 dividend per share at the end of the fiscal year. Net income for the year was $128,000. Common stockholders' equity was $585,000. A total of 25,000 shares of Series A stock were sold. Using this information, the return on common equity is calculated as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07018.gif" alt=" " width="454" height="196"/></p><p class="para">If the Series A stock had not been issued, then the preferred dividend could have been eliminated from the transaction, which would have increased the common shareholders' return to a much higher 22%. Consequently, one can conclude that this latest round of equity financing was extremely expensive for the common shareholders.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> A common clause in preferred stock agreements is that preferred stock shareholders will receive dividends in the same amount as any given to common shareholders. This requirement may be buried deep in the preferred stock purchase agreement and involve some digging to find. Also, there may be a cumulative dividend clause that pays dividends to preferred shareholders if the company did not make such payments at an earlier date.

By doing so, shareholders can determine whether their equity pool is increasing or decreasing and by how much.

The management team may modify the report so it can report a string of continuing increases (see the Cautions section); an alternative form of reporting is to base this measurement on cash flow per share, which is more difficult to alter. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07026.gif" alt=" " width="271" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Bouncing Billiard Ball Company's earnings have just been reported to the public.

To do this, managers may engage in a high degree of earnings management that shifts revenues and expenses into and out of different periods or asset-holding accounts, thereby modifying earnings to such an extent that it is not possible to tell if the reported level of earnings is the real level of earnings. Also, if a company's underlying business falls on hard times, managers may be tempted to fabricate earnings in order to maintain the unending string of earnings per share increases. For these reasons, several other performance measures should be reviewed to determine whether changes in the revenue level and expense structure appear to add up to the reported earnings per share, or if there is so much variation in these proportions between reporting periods that there is a good chance of management interference in the reported numbers.</p><p class="h1" id="c07-sec1-0013">ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Economic value added (EVA) shows the incremental rate of return in excess of a firm's total cost of capital. Stated differently, this is the surplus value created on an initial investment. It is <span class="italic">not</span> just the difference between a firm's percentage cost of capital and its actual rate of return percentage, since it is designed to yield a dollar surplus value. If the measurement is negative, then a company is not generating a return in excess of its capital costs. It is extremely important to break down the drivers of the measurement to determine what parts of a company are keeping the measure from reaching its maximum potential.</p><p class="para">EVA has become the most fashionable measurement for determining the ability of a company to generate an appropriate rate of return, thanks in part to the efforts of several consulting firms that specialize in installing the systems that roll up into this measurement. Some studies have shown that a favorable EVA measurement correlates closely with the market price achieved by a company's stock, so it can become the cornerstone of a company's efforts to increase its market value. It can also be linked to a company's compensation system, meaning that managers are paid based on their ability to combine efficient asset utilization with profitable operating results.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Multiply the net investment by the difference between the actual rate of return on assets and the percentage cost of capital. The three elements of the calculation are:</p><div class="list"><p class="listnumbered"><span class="bold">1.</span> Net investment. The net investment figure used in the formula is subject to a great deal of variation. In its most limited form, net valuation can be used for all fixed assets. Some assets may be subject to accelerated depreciation calculations, however, which reduce the amount of investment used in the calculation; a better approach is to use the straight-line depreciation method for all assets, with only the depreciation period varying by type of asset. A variation on this approach is to also add research and development, as well as training costs, back into the net investment, on the grounds that these expenditures are made to enhance the company's value over the long term. Also, if assets are leased rather than owned, they should be itemized as assets at their fair market value and included in the net investment figure so that managers cannot use financing tricks to enhance their return on investment.</p><p class="listnumbered"><span class="bold">2.</span> Actual return on investment. When calculating the return on investment, research and development, as well as training expenses, should be shifted out of operating expenses and into net investment (as noted in element 1). Also, any unusual adjustments to net income that do not involve ongoing operations should be eliminated. This results in an income figure that is related to those costs that can be legitimately expensed within the current period.</p><p class="listnumbered"><span class="bold">3.</span> Cost of capital.

How would you measure EVA over a period of time? You could simply track it on a trend line, but doing so would not factor in any changes in revenue. This is an important issue, since increasing sales tends to increase the investment in assets or reduce profitability, or both, either of which can reduce EVA. The solution is to use EVA momentum, which is the change in EVA over a period of time, divided by prior period sales. This approach shows how a business manages its EVA while altering its sales level.

This is particularly important when the ratio is greater than one, since it indicates that a company is dipping into its cash reserves to pay dividends, which is not a sustainable trend. Alternatively, if only a small proportion of earnings is being paid back as dividends, the remaining cash is likely being plowed back into operations, which should result in an increase in the stock price.

Also, in cases where the market price of a stock fluctuates significantly, the average market price during the measurement period may be used rather than its ending price. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07041.gif" alt=" " width="145" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Over the course of a year, the Glittering Magic Factory pays out two dividends, the first for $1.38 and the second for $1.50. Its stock price for the period averaged $32.50. Based on this information, its dividend yield ratio is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu07042.gif" alt=" " width="265" height="133"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As noted in the Description section, a stock's value is based on a combination of dividend payments and changes in its stock price, only the first half of which is covered by this calculation. If only the dividend yield ratio were used to value stocks, then most high-tech stocks would receive a valuation of zero, since they rarely issue dividends. </p></div></div>
