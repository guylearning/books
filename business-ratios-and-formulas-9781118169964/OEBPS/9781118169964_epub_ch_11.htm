The primary focus of the measurements described here is the department's ability to efficiently hire employees. Also included is employee turnover, which is perhaps the most popular employee-related measurement in use today.</p><p class="para">The measurements discussed in this chapter include:</p><table><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Employee Turnover<br/>Average Time to Hire<br/>Late Personnel Requisitions Ratio<br/>Sendouts per Hire</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Intern Hiring Percentage<br/>Ratio of Support Staff to Total Staff<br/>Employment Cost Effectiveness</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="h1" id="c11-sec1-0001">EMPLOYEE TURNOVER</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> In today's knowledge economy, a company's key assets (employees) walk out the door every night. Given the high cost of recruiting and retaining qualified employees, a major performance measure is a company's ability to keep the employee turnover level as low as possible.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Summarize the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees leaving the firm during the measurement period, and divide by the average number of employees on staff during that period. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu11001.gif" alt=" " width="542" height="39"/></p><p class="para">A full-time equivalent is the number of full-time employees who could have been employed if the reported number of hours worked by part-time employees had been worked by full-time employees.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Teacher turnover for all Nebraska school districts averages 18% per year. The superintendent of the Eagle school district wants to know by how much the turnover rate varies for her district. In the past year, the district employed an average of 412 full-time teachers, as well as 180 part-time instructors who work an average of 4 hours per day. During the year, 60 part-time instructors and 40 full-time teachers resigned.</p><p class="para">The total number of FTEs is calculated as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu11002.gif" alt=" " width="445" height="15"/></p><p class="para">The total number of resigning FTEs is calculated as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu11003.gif" alt=" " width="421" height="15"/></p><p class="para">The employee turnover calculation for the Eagle school district is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu11004.gif" alt=" " width="306" height="35"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> It can be extremely expensive to retain all employees, since a high-demand job market will inevitably result in some job shopping by employees in order to obtain the highest possible level of pay. As a result, employee turnover levels will inevitably be higher in certain geographical areas or for certain job positions, irrespective of management's efforts to retain staff.</p><p class="para">The employee turnover measure can be manipulated by shifting staffing needs to contractors, who are not usually included in the measure. Since contractors typically fill short-term positions, their use will improve turnover statistics.</p><p class="h1" id="c11-sec1-0002">AVERAGE TIME TO HIRE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A key function of the human resources department is its ability to hire staff within a reasonable time. This can be a difficult and lengthy process that is also subject to the opinions of the interviewers, thereby making it an even longer process that is not entirely under the control of the human resources department. It is possible, however, to judge the recruiting performance of the human resources department to some extent by using a measurement of the average time required to hire employees.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the offer acceptance date from the job application date, summarized for all completed job searches, and then divide the result by the number of completed job searches. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu11005.gif" alt=" " width="512" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> InfoSiblings, a rapidly growing genetic matching company, is obtaining large increases in its order backlog, and needs more staff to meet the increased level of demand. It records the job application and acceptance information over the past four quarters as shown in <a id="c11-tbl-001-1" href="#c11-tbl-001">Table 11.1</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c11-tbl-001" href="#c11-tbl-001-1">TABLE 11.1</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table11001.gif" alt=" " width="557" height="126"/></p><p class="para">Based on the increased time to hire, InfoSiblings' president concludes that the recruiting function has become a major bottleneck, and hires several additional recruiters to eliminate the bottleneck.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> There are a number of problems with this measurement. First, the human resources manager may mandate the hiring of lower-quality employees to drive down the time to hire. Second, the measure includes only those job postings for which the search has been completed; incomplete searches, which may have been open for many months, are not included at all. Third, department managers may continually reject candidates located by the human resources manager, which increases the length of the time to hire while not giving the human resources manager any real control over shortening the results. Thus, this measure should not be used as the sole criterion for human resources performance; using it in combination with other measures provides a better overall view of departmental performance.</p><p class="h1" id="c11-sec1-0003">LATE PERSONNEL REQUISITIONS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The preceding average time to hire (ATH) measure does not incorporate the impact of any unfilled jobs. The late personnel requisitions ratio is designed to supplement the ATH by specifically identifying the proportion of personnel requisitions that have not been filled. It is useful for identifying the scale of a company's recruiting difficulties.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span>  Divide the number of personnel requisitions open more than a defined number of days by the total number of personnel requisitions opened during the past three months. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu11006.gif" alt=" " width="423" height="40"/></p><p class="para">The three-months figure used in the denominator is designed to cover a sufficient amount of time to accumulate a reasonable number of personnel requisitions; a longer or shorter period can be used, based on a company's individual hiring volume.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Wonder Electronics is a consumer electronics manufacturing company and has quarterly hiring requirements in its Modesto plant for approximately 800 assembly positions. Due to a tight labor market, it is having difficulty filling positions. <a id="c11-tbl-002-1" href="#c11-tbl-002">Table 11.2</a> shows Wonder's proportion of personnel requisitions open past a 60-day benchmark.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c11-tbl-002" href="#c11-tbl-002-1">TABLE 11.2</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table11002.gif" alt=" " width="558" height="111"/></p><p class="para"><a href="#c11-tbl-002">Table 11.2</a> shows an increasing problem with positions remaining open, so Wonder's president authorizes a large hiring bonus to bring in more recruits.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measure can be manipulated by canceling a personnel requisition and issuing a new one, thereby shifting the age of the requisition below the benchmark used to trigger the measurement. It also does not give a good feel for the severity of a hiring problem for specific positions; for example, not being able to fill a key engineering position may be much more important than being unable to fill a janitorial slot.</p><p class="h1" id="c11-sec1-0004">SENDOUTS PER HIRE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Many companies use outside recruiting firms as part of their systems for hiring new employees. It is common enough to judge recruiters based on the fees they charge, but this takes no account of their efficiency in sending out to the company those individuals most likely to be hired. If a recruiter is sending out a flood of applicants, then the recruiter is not spending enough time screening them, or does not have an adequate knowledge of what the company wants. The sendouts per hire metric is useful for tracking this type of efficiency.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of sendouts into the number of hires from the group sent to the company by the recruiter. It is best to calculate sendouts per hire over a large number of positions, since there may be anomalies related to individual positions that do not realistically reflect on the performance of the recruiter.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Wilco Electronics needs to hire a group of designers for its new series of ham radios that are powerful enough to communicate with orbiting astronauts. It requires an exacting set of specifications for each person hired. Wilco issues job requirements to three recruiting firms, with the following results:</p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/tableu11001.gif" alt=" " width="400" height="93"/></p><p class="para">The table shows that Charlie Recruiters has the highest sendouts per hire ratio, possibly reflecting its ability to locate the people most closely matching Wilco's requirements.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Sendouts per hire can vary substantially by the type of technical training required, geographic region, how well the company has defined positions for recruiters to act upon, and the pickiness of the individuals at the company making the final hiring decisions. Thus, the sendout ratio may be quite high if a recruiting firm is filling janitorial positions, since the hiring standards for such positions are low. Conversely, a high-end programming position may require the services of a person so difficult to find that the number of sendouts per hire may be extremely large.</p><p class="h1" id="c11-sec1-0005">INTERN HIRING PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> In some service industries, such as consulting, companies consider it important to bring in a large number of college interns during the summer months and later hire a proportion of them as full-time staff once they graduate from college. This approach allows the company to evaluate prospective employees for a number of months, allowing for higher odds of retaining a long-term employee.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total number of intern job offers accepted by the total number of interns working during the previous year. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu11007.gif" alt=" " width="445" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Wilson Ross, the famous consulting firm, regularly hires summer interns each year, and offers jobs to the best of this group once they graduate the following year. Wilson's human resources vice president is comparing the proportion of interns hired to their long-term survival with the company so as to set a realistic intern hiring rate for all Wilson offices. She has obtained the information in <a id="c11-tbl-003-1" href="#c11-tbl-003">Table 11.3</a> for four Wilson offices.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c11-tbl-003" href="#c11-tbl-003-1">TABLE 11.3</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table11003.gif" alt=" " width="556" height="109"/></p><p class="para">Based on this information, it appears that the optimal intern hiring percentage is in the vicinity of 45%, since the employee turnover rate increases drastically once higher proportions of interns are hired. The human resources vice president immediately issues an edict to all Wilson offices to set the targeted intern hiring rate at 45%.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The objective is not to achieve a 100% intern hiring percentage, since the evaluation period will likely turn up a few people whom the company is not interested in hiring. Thus, most organizations should set a target intern hiring percentage that may be closer to one-half (or less) of all interns, based on past experience, and judiciously extend offers only to the best of the interns so as to meet that percentage.</p><p class="h1" id="c11-sec1-0006">RATIO OF SUPPORT STAFF TO TOTAL STAFF</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> If a company employs a high proportion of billable employees, such as a consulting firm, a prime determinant of profitability is its ability to operate with the lowest possible proportion of support staff to the total number of employees. Tracking the ratio of support staff to total staff is a good way to monitor overhead costs.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the average number of full-time equivalent (FTE) support staff by the average number of all FTE employees. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu11008.gif" alt=" " width="385" height="40"/></p><p class="para">An FTE is the number of full-time employees who could have been employed if the reported number of hours worked by part-time employees had been worked by full-time employees.</p><p class="para">An alternative version of this formula is to divide the fully burdened <span class="italic">cost</span> of the support staff by the fully burdened <span class="italic">cost</span> of all employees. By doing so, attention is focused on the more expensive support positions.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Arthur Bulger engineering consulting firm has been suffering from declining profits for several years, despite rapid growth. The founder, Mr. Bulger, suspects that increasing numbers of support staff are the root cause of this problem. He accumulates the information shown in <a id="c11-tbl-004-1" href="#c11-tbl-004">Table 11.4</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c11-tbl-004" href="#c11-tbl-004-1">TABLE 11.4</a></span></p><p class="para"><img src="../OEBPS/images/table11004.gif" alt=" " width="558" height="88"/></p><p class="para">It is evident that the company's rapid growth has masked a significant rise in overhead costs, represented by the large increase in the support staff. Mr. Bulger immediately initiates a cost-benefit review to determine which support staff positions are really needed.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measure can be manipulated by outsourcing some support functions, such as accounting and human resources; this improves the ratio, even though the cost of the support functions is still being paid to an outside provider.</p><p class="h1" id="c11-sec1-0007">EMPLOYMENT COST EFFECTIVENESS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A local government may be interested in issuing tax credits to a business to persuade it to locate within the geographical area administered by the government entity on the grounds that the business will hire local residents. It may be worthwhile, however, to examine the employment cost effectiveness of the business before offering any tax credits. Some companies are very capital intensive and so give the appearance of being capable of hiring, and yet do not do so, either as a result of automation or because they outsource labor-intensive tasks to suppliers.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Add together the initial investment in a business and the amount raised during its initial public offering (if any) and divide by the number of employees working in the company 10 years later. Or, if the company has not been in business that long, simply run the ratio on a trend line. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu11009.gif" alt=" " width="219" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Zippee Backup operates an online backup system for the consumer market. It wants to open a data facility in Billings, Montana, but wants a $5 million, 10-year interest-free loan from the municipal government in exchange for doing so. The controller of Billings calculates the employment cost effectiveness of Zippee and learns that Zippee only generates one job per $250,000 invested in it. This is because of the high infrastructure cost of Zippee facilities. The government does not see a good reason for extending the loan when there is such a low probability of increased hiring by the company, based on historical evidence.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measure is derived from historical information, and so may not be a good indicator of future performance. Nonetheless, a company that is currently capital-intensive is likely to remain that way. Conversely, if a business has a poor employment cost effectiveness ratio due to its outsourcing practices, those practices could potentially be reversed, which could substantially alter the ratio in the future. </p></div></div>
