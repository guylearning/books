Instead, most of the information from which they are derived is obtained from other sources, such as tracking systems for units of production, machinery utilization time, and scrap tracking. These systems may not be as tightly controlled as financial systems, so the data used for these measurements should be tested to ensure that it is of a sufficient quality to yield accurate information.</p><p class="para">The measurements described in this chapter fall into several categories: the utilization of key production constraints, also known as bottleneck operations; overall productivity and effectiveness; asset usage; and overhead expense utilization. The measurements discussed in this chapter include:</p><table class="bodycell" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell">Constraint Productivity<br/>Takt Time<br/>Constraint Rework Percentage<br/>Constraint Schedule Attainment<br/>Constraint Utilization<br/>Operational Equipment Effectiveness<br/>Degree of Unbalance<br/>Throughput Effectiveness<br/>Manufacturing Critical Path Time<br/>Manufacturing Efficiency<br/>Break-Even Plant Capacity<br/>Manufacturing Effectiveness<br/>Productivity Index<br/>Unit Output per Direct Labor Hour<br/>Average Equipment Setup Time</td><td class="bodycell">Unscheduled Machine Downtime Percentage<br/>Mean Time between Failures<br/>Acceptable Product Completion Percentage<br/>Work-in-Process Turnover<br/>Work-in-Process to Standard Work-<br/>in-Process<br/>Scrap Percentage<br/>First-Time-Through Yield<br/>Warranty Claims Percentage<br/>Maintenance Expense to Fixed Assets Ratio<br/>Indirect Expense Index<br/>Reorder Point<br/>On-Time Delivery Ratio</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-001">CONSTRAINT PRODUCTIVITY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> An efficient management team wants to increase the productivity of its bottleneck operation, since increasing the amount of throughput at this location will enhance the company's overall ability to generate a larger profit. If the efficiency of some other operations were to be enhanced, the bottleneck would still exist, and so overall manufacturing output would not improve.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total number of units produced per hour by the number of hours worked at the bottleneck operation. If several different products are being continually run through the bottleneck operation, all requiring different processing times, then the measure should be separately calculated for each product so that productivity can be more precisely determined. The measurement should be tracked on a trend line to help spot changes in the level of productivity. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13001.gif" alt=" " width="229" height="32"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Aboriginal Paintwork Company runs all of its hand-thrown ceramic products through a kiln, which is the bottleneck in its single-shift operation. The plant manager wants to see if an ongoing effort to reduce setup, baking, and retrieval times has yielded a greater degree of efficiency at this operation. The manager collects information over a three-month period that includes several company holidays, which is shown in <a id="c13-tbl-001-1" href="#c13-tbl-001">Table 13.1</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c13-tbl-001" href="#c13-tbl-001-1">TABLE 13.1</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table13001.gif" alt="" width="558" height="120"/><p class="para">The table shows that the increased number of workdays occurring during the three-month period has created the appearance of greater efficiency at the kiln, even though the actual level of productivity has gradually declined on a per-hour basis throughout the period.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measurement can yield misleading results if the mix of units produced carries a lower profit margin than some other mix that might require the production of fewer units, resulting in a high level of productivity to create a smaller profit than might otherwise be attained. Consequently, this measure should be used in conjunction with a review of the total gross margin being generated by the bottleneck operation.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-002">TAKT TIME</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A basic concept of lean manufacturing is called the drumbeat, or pace, at which a manufacturing facility must operate in order to meet a certain level of customer demand. For example, if a company is receiving customer demand of 320 units per day, and the facility is producing goods at 960 minutes per day (e.g., 16 hours, or 2 shifts), then its <span class="italic">takt</span> time is five minutes per unit (960 minutes/320 units). To meet the current level of demand, it must find a way to produce one unit no later than once every five minutes. Thus, takt time is essentially the demand for a company's capacity; whether a company can meet this demand with its in-house or outsourced production capacity is an issue for management to resolve.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total daily production operations time by the daily requirement for a product. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13002.gif" alt=" " width="120" height="37"/></p><p class="para">The basic takt time measurement is too theoretical for most companies, because it does not include variations in the required quantity caused by such factors as the buildup of inventory for a high-volume selling season, or for planned changes in the finished goods inventory buffer. Similarly, the operating time in the numerator can be adjusted for such factors as a planned factory shutdown, periodic maintenance, employee vacations, and so on. If the takt time measurement is modified to include these additional factors, it is known as <span class="italic">operational takt time</span>.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The production schedule of the Squat Ski Company, maker of very wide powder skis, requires the company to produce 110 skis per day. Given the highly seasonal nature of this product, most of the production schedule is made up of inventory planning requirements, rather than actual customer orders. The company shuts down entirely in March, which is when the ski sales season is over. The company operates on one ten-hour (600-minute) shift. When employee breaks of 30 minutes and scheduled preventive maintenance downtime of 20 minutes are included, the actual operating time of the facility is 550 minutes. Squat Ski's operational takt time is calculated as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13003.gif" alt=" " width="316" height="38"/></p><p class="para">Unfortunately, Squat Ski's production manager cannot reduce cycle time to less than six minutes per unit. To meet the operational takt time, the company must either schedule overtime work, find ways to reduce its cycle time, or continue production during March, when the company normally shuts down.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> In most cases, operational takt time is more useful than takt time, since operational takt time includes a variety of planning anomalies that yield a much more realistic view of how much production time is actually required to produce a unit of output.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-003">CONSTRAINT REWORK PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A bottleneck operation limits the total amount of production work that can be completed by a manufacturing facility, so the volume of work passing through it must be maximized. This objective can be severely impinged upon when production rework must be passed through the bottleneck for refinishing work, since the bottleneck operation must duplicate previously completed work, which infringes upon its ability to complete new work that would otherwise have created additional profits. Consequently, the production manager should closely track the amount of rework time at the bottleneck operation.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total rework hours used in a constraint operation by the total number of hours available at the constraint. For example, if a constraint operation can be used 24 hours a day, then this should be used in the denominator. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13004.gif" alt=" " width="276" height="33"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Premium Woodworking Company runs nearly all of its furniture products through a belt-sanding operation, which is its production bottleneck. A number of sanding problems have been recognized downstream from this operation, necessitating rework that must pass through the belt sander a second time. It is also possible to sand the flaws by hand, although this takes much more labor to complete. The belt-sanding operation runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Should the constraint rework measurement be used in this situation, and if so, how should it be measured?</p><p class="para">The measurement should be used because the bottleneck belt-sanding operation is operating at its absolute capacity with no room for rework tasks. If sanding flaws can be corrected by hand, then this option should be pursued instead of using any capacity in the bottleneck for the same task. The measurement should only include any rework that is actually run through the belt-sanding operation, since this reflects the production manager's inability to shift rework away from the bottleneck. For example, if three hours of rework were required for manual sanding and two hours for belt sanding in a 24-hour day, then only the two hours used for belt sanding should be divided by the 24 hours of available capacity to arrive at a constraint rework percentage of 2/24, or 8.3%.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Rework that can be shifted to other machines than the bottleneck operation should be excluded from the calculation, but only if it is in fact shifted elsewhere. Also, this measurement is less valid in situations in which companies use their bottleneck operations for less than a 24-hour day, since they can simply schedule some overtime work to handle excess work requirements.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-004">CONSTRAINT SCHEDULE ATTAINMENT</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A bottleneck operation is being used most efficiently when the exact amount of production scheduled to pass through it actually does so. If the wrong items or a reduced number of items pass through it, then a company will not realize the maximum amount of profits from its operation. This measurement is used to determine a production manager's efficiency in producing in accordance with the production plan.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of part hours actually produced by the number of part hours scheduled at the constraint operation. This measure can be used for all operations within a manufacturing facility, but the key measurement is on the constraint operation, since shortfalls here will have the largest impact on overall output. If there is rework needed to complete the production schedule, then this should be added to the numerator in the formula. Also, the number of hours of work itemized in the production schedule is based on the standard estimate of hours required. If the work is completed with a variance from the standard, then this variance should be included in the numerator in the formula. The basic formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13005.gif" alt=" " width="138" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Acme Roadrunner Tire Company produces 20 tires of various sizes. During the current month, its 10 tire lamination machines are scheduled to produce tires for a total of 7,200 hours, which constitutes full production for 24 hours a day for all of the machines. The production team completes 6,980 hours of production on regularly scheduled jobs during this time. In addition, because of engineering improvements, they saved 100 hours from the standard production time estimated for completion of the job, due to better monitoring of the tire lamination times. Also, several batches of tires were found to be faulty, resulting in 250 hours of rework. To determine the constraint schedule attainment ratio, the production manager uses the following calculation:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13006.gif" alt=" " width="561" height="136"/></p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bold">Cautions:</span> The number of part hours produced may not encompass the parts itemized in the production schedule, so the underlying data should be cross-checked against the production schedule from time to time to ensure that the exact part types and quantities dictated by the schedule are being followed. Also, the resulting measurement may seem to indicate that the production schedule was precisely met, but can still be incorrect if the sequence in which production orders was completed is different from the schedule. For example, if a production job is scheduled to be run and completed on the first day of the month, but is actually run on the last day, then a measurement encompassing the entire month will still indicate that the production schedule was successfully met, even though the customer had to wait much longer than promised to receive the product. To avoid this issue, the constraint schedule attainment measurement should be run for very short times so that the timing of jobs within the schedule cannot be shifted while still appearing to meet the schedule.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-005">CONSTRAINT UTILIZATION</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> If there is no production schedule in place, then there is no need for the preceding constraint schedule attainment measure. Instead, simply measure the amount of usage of the bottleneck operation, irrespective of what types of work are passed through it. This measure does not tell one if the highest-profit goods are being prioritized in the constraint operation, as would be the case if a production schedule were used, so it is a less precise measure.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the actual hours during which the constraint operation is used by the total number of constraint hours available. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13007.gif" alt=" " width="272" height="34"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Medic First Response Corporation assembles first aid kits in an assembly line. The shrink wrapper at the end of the line is the production constraint. This machine runs at approximately one-third the speed of the assembly line, so it must operate on all three shifts in order to keep up with the output from the assembly line. Accordingly, the production manager is quite interested in maintaining the highest degree of shrink wrapper utilization. During the preceding five-day workweek, the machine was in operation for 110.5 hours. To determine the constraint utilization, the manager runs the following calculation:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13008.gif" alt=" " width="297" height="112"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As noted in the Description section, this measure can look good as long as any sort of work is constantly being run through the constraint operation. Since this may exclude highly profitable production from being placed first in the work queue, the measure does not relate well to the amount of profits being generated. Consequently, if this measure is used, it should be combined with a summary review of profits being generated by the operation, preferably on a trend line.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-006">OPERATIONAL EQUIPMENT EFFECTIVENESS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> When a company has a bottleneck operation in its production area, that constraint is keeping the company from attaining additional profitability. This means that management should be very concerned with the ability of that operation to produce on time and at the correct quality level. This involves reducing machine downtime, ensuring that it operates at the correct rate of production and that goods are completed without scrap on their first time through the process. These factors are combined into the operational equipment effectiveness metric, which management should monitor regularly.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> This is one of the more complex metrics to calculate. At a summary level, the formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13009.gif" alt=" " width="306" height="34"/></p><p class="paraaftertitle">The calculation of availability is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13010.gif" alt=" " width="199" height="38"/></p><p class="paraaftertitle">The calculation of performance effi ciency is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13011.gif" alt=" " width="102" height="37"/></p><p class="paraaftertitle">The calculation of quality is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13012.gif" alt=" " width="430" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The production manager of Monterey Manufacturing wants to know the operational equipment effectiveness of his bottleneck operation. He has the following information for that operation:</p><ul class="list"><li class="listbulleted">Availability = 92%</li><li class="listbulleted">Performance efficiency = 83%</li><li class="listbulleted">Quality = 96%</li></ul><p class="para">Based on this information, the bottleneck operation has the following operational equipment effectiveness:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13013.gif" alt=" " width="412" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measurement does a good job of aggregating disparate information into a general measure of the performance of a work area. However, to provide the detailed information needed for management changes, you then need to drill down through the three measurements (availability, performance efficiency, and quality) that you just used to compile the metric. Thus, it may make more sense to separately report and act upon the underlying measurements.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-007">DEGREE OF UNBALANCE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The degree of unbalance refers to the amount of productive capacity in a production cell that cannot be used because of the presence of a production bottleneck. This measure is used by the industrial engineering staff and production manager to determine which bottleneck operations within cells should be improved or supplemented so that the degree of unbalance is reduced. By doing so, the productive flow within a manufacturing cell becomes much smoother and can achieve a higher rate of output.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Measure the capacity change between the bottleneck operation and the next most restrictive operation within a manufacturing cell. A variation on this approach is to determine the average capacity of all other machines in the work cell and use this amount in the denominator. A ratio close to 100% reveals a minimum degree of imbalance. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13014.gif" alt=" " width="426" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The production manager of the McGraw Rifle Company is concerned about the size of a prospective order from the army for a new military submachine gun called the P-16. The work center that produces this weapon is composed of a series of lathes, metal shears, and stamping machines. The three lathes in this work center are the capacity constraint, followed by the metal shears, and then the stamping machines. The production manager wants to determine the degree of imbalance within the work center, so that more bottleneck equipment can be ordered, which will increase the work center's capacity to deal with the large incoming military order. The manager accumulates capacity information, which is shown in <a id="c13-tbl-002-1" href="#c13-tbl-002">Table 13.2</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c13-tbl-002" href="#c13-tbl-002-1">TABLE 13.2</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top"></td><td class="bodycell" valign="top"><span class="bold">Capacity per Week</span></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Lathes</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">875</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Shears</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1,125</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Stamping machines</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2,500</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">Divide the weekly capacity of the lathes, at 875 units, by the weekly capacity of the shears to arrive at a degree of imbalance measurement of 78%. There is a difference of 250 units of productive capacity between the lathes and shears, which is somewhat less than the 292-unit weekly capacity of a single lathe. The manager must therefore purchase one additional lathe in order to eliminate the imbalance between lathes and shears.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The measurement variation that uses the average capacity of all nonbottleneck operations in a work cell as the denominator can result in a misleading measurement. For example, if the industrial engineering staff finds that the degree of unbalance is an excessive 50% by using this measurement, it may find, after doubling the capacity of the bottleneck, that the degree of unbalance has improved to only 60%. The reason is that the averaging technique used to derive the denominator has masked the capacity problem presented by the next most restrictive workstation, which is much worse than the average.</p><p class="para">The degree of unbalance may not be a very useful number for work cells that rarely reach their maximum levels of production capacity. It is most useful in situations in which production equipment is being fully used over all three shifts and is having difficulty keeping pace with the level of demand.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-008">THROUGHPUT EFFECTIVENESS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This measure reveals the trade-off between maximizing throughput and other operating expenses. For example, if a production manager is strictly focused on increasing the amount of throughput (revenue less variable expenses) at the constraint operation, the price may be spending inordinate amounts on improving logistics at the constraint operation, improving its setup time, offloading work to other operations, and so on. Comparing throughput to these other operating expenses can help determine the point at which the ratio can no longer be maximized, which implies that additional operating expenses should not be incurred from that point on. In essence, this measure allows incremental analyses to be performed of the trade-off between incurring extra operational expenses and improving throughput. If the measure results in a ratio of anything greater than 1:1, then a prospective increase in operating costs that can be tied to an increase in gross margins should be accepted.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract all variable production expenses from gross revenues, and divide the result by operating production expenses. In the strictest sense, variable production expenses can be construed as only direct materials, with all other production expenses falling into the category of operating production expenses. Also, when compiling operating expenses to use in the denominator, be sure to exclude all expenses that have no bearing on the production function, such as sales, general, and administrative expenses. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13015.gif" alt=" " width="220" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> A production manager is interested in adding a quality control person to a constraint operation to help him manually review 100% of the materials coming into the machine. The machine becomes clogged by low-quality parts whose dimensions are fractionally incorrect, resulting in one hour of downtime to clear the machine. On average, these clogs occur 1.5 times per day during a 360-day production year. The amount of revenue that could have been produced while these clogs are cleared averages $800 per hour. The average variable cost required for each dollar of revenue is $0.78. The quality control person will cost $32,000 per year, including payroll taxes and related benefits. Using the throughput effectiveness measurement, is it cost-effective to incrementally make this addition to the production operation? The production manager uses the following formula:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13016.gif" alt=" " width="545" height="205"/></p><p class="para">The ratio of 3:1 indicates that the addition of an inspector to the constraint operation will result in an increase in the gross margin that exceeds the incremental cost by a factor of three. Therefore, the production manager should hire the quality control person.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This is an excellent measurement to use, but it requires detailed analysis to ensure that actual cost changes are in line with the amounts used in the measurement so that decisions based on this ratio will result in real incremental improvements in the effectiveness of a company's throughput.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-009">MANUFACTURING CRITICAL PATH TIME</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The manufacturing critical path time (MCT) is the time interval from when a manufacturing order is created until the first element of that order is received by the customer. MCT shows the minimum amount of time required to actually create a product and deliver it, which can include the time needed to obtain necessary parts from suppliers. This measure is ideal for lean production environments, which are designed to have minimal buffer inventory on hand. It is also useful as a baseline measurement for manufacturing improvement initiatives.</p><p class="para">MCT can also be used to measure the performance of suppliers; for example, a long MCT and high supplier quality may indicate the use of extensive supplier inspection activities, while a long MCT and short delivery lead time indicate the presence of a significant finished goods inventory buffer.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the customer delivery date and time from the order receipt date and time. A more accurate approach is to summarize the total supplier lead time, all queue times, manufacturing times, inspection times, and delivery times, since the preceding formula's results can be artificially shortened by the presence of buffer inventories. Note the measurement problem described in the Cautions section.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Whirlaway Company wants to implement a lean initiative in its manufacturing area for its helicopter kit product line. The company stocks significant amounts of finished goods and work-in-process inventory, so its industrial engineering staff is called upon to assemble the baseline information in <a id="c13-tbl-003-1" href="#c13-tbl-003">Table 13.3</a> to determine its MCT.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c13-tbl-003" href="#c13-tbl-003-1">TABLE 13.3</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Longest supplier lead time</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">37 days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total queue times</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">18 days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total manufacturing times</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">8 days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total quality inspection times</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2 days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total delivery time</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">3 days</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total MCT</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">68 days</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Deliveries from stock can significantly and artificially reduce the reported MCT since they hide the time required to actually procure supplies and manufacture products. To avoid false measurements, it is necessary to have industrial engineers measure the actual manufacturing and procurement processes required to fulfill the order, as described in the Formula and Example sections.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0010">MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Though the preceding manufacturing effectiveness measure is a prime driver of corporate profitability, it is also useful to determine the overall level of efficiency of manufacturing operations. The manufacturing efficiency measure determines the proportion of value-added operational time to the total amount of time required to convert raw materials into finished goods. Typical efficiency measures can be hundreds or even thousands to one, because of the large proportion of setup times, queue times, and materials-handling times built into a manufacturing operation. Thus, the manufacturing efficiency measure can be a prime benchmark for an ongoing drive to improve the overall level of manufacturing efficiency.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Measure the time between the withdrawal of materials from storage until the completed goods are stored in the finished goods warehouse, which is the current cycle time. Then divide the current cycle time by the processing time of manufacturing operations that add value to the product. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13017.gif" alt=" " width="118" height="37"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Pilkington Pottery's president is concerned about the lengthy lead time required to produce the company's signature line of high-end decorative pottery. From beginning to end, the current cycle time is 23 days (552 hours) to create an average pottery piece. He accumulates the valued-added information about the manufacturing process in <a id="c13-tbl-004-1" href="#c13-tbl-004">Table 13.4</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c13-tbl-004" href="#c13-tbl-004-1">TABLE 13.4</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Process</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Value-Added Time</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Pottery throwing</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1 hour</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Glazing</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1 hour</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Firing and cool down</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">33 hours</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Painting and finishing</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2 hours</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total value-added time</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">37 hours</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">Thus, the manufacturing efficiency ratio is 552 hours of total cycle time, divided by 37 hours of value-added time, or approximately 15:1. Further investigation reveals that pottery is being stored between the firing and painting processes for an inordinate period of time, because the prime manufacturing measurement is kiln utilization, resulting in more pottery being fired than can be handled by the downstream painting operation.

The director finds that the facility is currently operating at 40% capacity, that its sales are $46,500,000, its variable expenses are $30,925,000, and its fixed costs are $25,425,000.

For example, the hours used might be for rework, for production that is later scrapped, or for testing or setup. If a significant proportion of the production hours used at a constraint operation are used in these activities, then the number of throughput hours used to create products that are actually shipped to customers will be reduced, resulting in lower profits.

However, the manager suspects that some of the output of this equipment is not being shipped to customers.

If so, the measurement of constraint hours consumed will fall into one reporting period, while the measurement of throughput hours shipped may fall into another, making it difficult to compile the information needed for the measurement. To avoid this problem, manually measure the types of throughput hours consumed at the constraint operation, though this can be subject to error (especially if the person tracking the information is also the subject of the resulting measurement).</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0013">PRODUCTIVITY INDEX</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The productivity index can be used to measure a variety of activities within a production operation that lead to changes in the volume of units manufactured. For example, if the total amount of maintenance hours spent on a work cell is increased, there may be a resulting increase in the total number of units of production from that cell, since it is assumed that the increased maintenance efforts will result in more functional equipment. Similarly, if more direct labor dollars are spent in an assembly line, there should be a corresponding increase in the volume of units produced. The productivity index is used to measure the incremental change in output that results from these changes in productive inputs.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total change in output quantities by the total change in input quantities. This formula is structured in a deliberately vague manner so that it can be used for a number of applications. For example, the change in scrapped units can be compared to a change in additional hours spent on training machine operators. Alternatively, the change in production line output can be compared to a change in the number of production line personnel added to the production process. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13022.gif" alt=" " width="216" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> A punch press operation is producing an excessive quantity of scrap because operators are poorly positioning parts on the presses. The production manager chooses to provide extensive additional training to the press operators in hopes that this will cure the problem. As a result of spending 312 hours of both operator and trainer time, the scrap rate drops from 15% to 8%. The production manager would like to create a productivity index to measure this change, but thinks that a comparison of the existing numbers would be a comparison of “apples to oranges.” Accordingly, the manager converts the inputs and outputs into dollars. The 312 hours of staff time spent on training was at an hourly cost of $19.50, which is a total input of $6,084. The manager multiplies the incremental improvement in the scrap rate of 7% by the direct material cost per unit of $4.25 and by the monthly unit production volume of 10,000 units, which results in an incremental change in output of $2,975. This results in a productivity index of $2,975/$6,084, or 49%, in just one production period. When the comparison is extended over several periods, the ongoing improvement in scrap levels will yield a very high productivity index.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> When using this measurement, be careful to isolate the change in input so that it can be clearly identified as a cause of the change in output. For example, if five separate changes are made to the production process, it is impossible to determine what proportion of the resulting change in production outputs was caused by each one. Instead, to make this measure work properly, one change should be made at a time so that it can be more precisely related to changes in the units of output.</p><p class="para">It is also possible that there is no direct causal relationship between an input and an output, in which case the comparison should not be made at all.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0014">UNIT OUTPUT PER DIRECT LABOR HOUR</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This measurement is most useful in those increasingly rare situations in which the primary form of value added to a product is direct labor. In most situations, direct labor composes only a small proportion of the value added, so there is only a poor causal relationship between the amount of unit output and the number of direct labor hours worked. When the proportion of hours worked is high, however, this measure can have some value.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Add together the total number of units completed during the production period and the total number of unit equivalents, less the total number of unit equivalents recorded at the end of the preceding reporting period. Then divide the result by the total number of direct labor hours in the reporting period. A <span class="italic">unit</span> equivalent is defined as that completed proportion of an incomplete unit of production on which work has been finished. For example, if a product is 40% complete, then it is 0.40 unit equivalents. If another product were 20% complete, then it would be 0.20 unit equivalents. When combined, the two units would be 0.60 unit equivalents. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13023.gif" alt=" " width="546" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> There are three major jobs running through the production shop of the Overhead Hoist Company. At the end of the preceding period, Job A was 30% complete, Job B was 49% complete, and Job C was 83% complete. When combined, this amounted to a unit equivalent of 1.62 units of production (30% + 49% + 83%). At the end of the current reporting period, Job C was completed and shipped. Job A was 85% complete, Job C was 98% complete, and Job D was 32% complete. The number of direct labor hours worked in the shop in the current period was 2,418. The calculation of unit output per direct labor hour is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13024.gif" alt=" " width="419" height="284"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> When compiling data for this measurement, be careful about the method used to derive equivalent units. If handled in a nonquantitative manner, the number of unit equivalents can be severely skewed. A good approach is to determine the number of actual hours already spent on a product, per the job tracking system, and compare this to the standard number of hours recorded on the labor routing to determine the percentage of completion. For example, if a product requires a standard amount of 17 hours of labor, and 12 hours of actual work have thus far been completed, then it can be assumed to be 70% (12 actual hours divided by 17 standard hours) complete. However, verify the accuracy of the standard hours listed in the labor routings to ensure their accuracy. It may also be necessary to set up controls over who is charging time to jobs so that actual hours charged are not improperly charged.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0015">AVERAGE EQUIPMENT SETUP TIME</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This measurement is useful in situations in which equipment is being run at maximum capacity, so it is critical to have the smallest possible amount of equipment downtime between production runs. It is also useful in just-in-time production environments, where equipment setups occur frequently and can take up a large part of the time in a production process.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the stop time for the preceding production run from the start time for the next production run. This approach works best where an automated machine usage tracking system has been installed. It assumes, however, that there are jobs continually following each other that require continual shifts to new jobs, with no downtime in between. The measure will not work if there are no jobs immediately preceding an equipment setup, since there will be no start time. If this is the case, the start and stop times can be manually tracked, though this tends to be inaccurate (especially when the person doing the time tracking is also responsible for the setup).

Because a considerable degree of retooling is required to switch machinery over to a different transmission, the equipment setup time can take over a week to complete. The factory is making no money during this interval, so the equipment setup procedures are of great concern to management—anything to shorten the setup time will save them money. They use videotaped practice setups to determine what steps can be eliminated or shortened, finding that half of the setup time can be eliminated simply through the prepositioning of parts, using different types of lockdown bolts, and requiring the setup staffs to use a formal setup checklist. As a result, the total setup interval drops from seven days to three days. During the four days of saved setup time, the factory is able to produce an additional 582 transmissions, each with a gross profit of $225 dollars. The management team finds that its setup reduction efforts have resulted in an increase in profits of $130,950 (582 transmissions × $225 gross profit).</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> When this measure is being reported manually by equipment setup teams, they will have an incentive to report a short setup time if they have any sort of performance incentive to keep setups short. In such cases, their efforts should be spot-checked by an independent observer from time to time. A much better approach is to use an automated machine usage tracking system that automatically sends information to a central location; however, these systems are expensive.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0016">UNSCHEDULED MACHINE DOWNTIME PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A well-organized factory has a schedule of planned maintenance for all of its key equipment, around which the production schedule is organized. When equipment fails outside of this schedule, the production planning staff must quickly reorganize the production schedule around the capacity of whatever equipment is no longer available for use. This can wreak havoc with a factory's productive capacity in the short term, with particular problems arising for the promised delivery dates of products that must be processed on the equipment that has failed. The unscheduled machine downtime percentage is most useful for tracking a company's ability to minimize this problem.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total minutes of unscheduled machine downtime by the total minutes of machine time.

Furthermore, the production planning staff must plan for longer lead times when quoting delivery times to customers while the company's ability to work at a high level of capacity utilization is reduced. By tracking the mean time between failures for production equipment, management can target more preventive maintenance of key equipment, install quick-change procedures, stock more spare parts that are frequently replaced, and install redundant equipment to ensure that the overall flow of production is not impaired.

The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13031.gif" alt=" " width="165" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Flyaway Bike Company has recently installed a manufacturing resources planning (MRP II) system with advanced shop floor reporting and production scheduling capabilities. It should result in much better control over the production process and reduce the amount of work-in-process inventory needed. The production manager wants to affirm that the company is receiving the full benefit of this system by measuring the work-in-process turnover. He collects the information in <a id="c13-tbl-009-1" href="#c13-tbl-009">Table 13.9</a> for a four-month period; the MRP II system was installed midway through the measured period.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c13-tbl-009" href="#c13-tbl-009-1">TABLE 13.9</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table13009.gif" alt="" width="558" height="98"/><p class="para">The turnover trend line in the table confirms that the MRP II system appears to be gradually increasing the work-in-process turnover rate. The production manager decides to continue monitoring this measure over time since there appears to be a declining trend line that may continue into the future.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The exact amount of work-in-process currently in use can be an extremely difficult number to determine. If a company uses a manual system for tracking all of its inventory transfers in and out of production, then the amount of effort needed to compile this information will probably not be worth the effort. A better approach is to use a manufacturing resources planning (MRP II) computer system to track work-in-process, resulting in a simple automated report to obtain the required information.</p><p class="para">Also, this measure is not useful in a just-in-time (JIT) production environment, since there should theoretically be so little work-in-process inventory that the measure would be meaningless. Also, JIT systems are designed for minimal reporting systems in the production process, so it is unlikely that the needed information would be available.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0020">WORK-IN-PROCESS TO STANDARD WORK-IN-PROCESS</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> When a company creates a production cell under just-in-time manufacturing principles, the intent is to have very little work-in-process (WIP) inventory in the cell, which reduces the inventory investment and also prevents the stockpiling of faulty parts. The industrial engineering staff should have calculated the amount of WIP that should be on hand in the cell, so you can compare the actual WIP to the standard amount of WIP by using the work-in-process to standard work-in-process (WIP-to-SWIP) ratio. The ratio should be as close to one as possible.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> This is a two-stage calculation. You must first calculate the standard work-in-process, which is the standard amount of processing time plus the time to load and unload the machine, divided by the process cycle time. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13032.gif" alt=" " width="238" height="40"/></p><p class="para">You then divide the total amount of actual WIP inventory in the work cell by the standard WIP inventory for that work cell. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13033.gif" alt=" " width="243" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The industrial engineering staff of the Monterey Manufacturing Company has designed a new manufacturing cell for which it estimates that the standard amount of WIP should be three units. During the day on Monday, the amount of actual WIP in the cell is continually monitored, and it is averaging 5 units at any given time. Thus, the WIP-to-SWIP ratio is 1.66. Clearly, the performance of the cell is not anywhere near the standard created for it by the industrial engineers.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> Any standard is a theoretical number that may prove to be quite difficult to attain, so the comparison used as the foundation for this metric may not always be valid. It is perhaps more useful when tracked on a trend line to determine whether the ratio changes over time, irrespective of the exact amount of the ratio.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0021">SCRAP PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The amount of scrap generated by a production operation is of great concern to the production manager, for it can be indicative of a number of problems—poor training of the direct labor work force, improper machine setup, materials handling problems, or even the ordering of substandard raw materials. Another reason for keeping a close watch over the scrap percentage is that inordinate amounts of scrap may require extensive revisions to the production schedule to help produce extra goods, which in turn will require short-term changes to the purchasing schedule so as to bring in the required raw materials. For these reasons, the scrap percentage is one of the most closely watched performance measurements in the factory.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> The amount of scrap that a company produces is difficult to measure because it can be produced in many parts of a facility, and in many cases it is not accumulated for measurement purposes. If this is the case, the best approach is to subtract the standard cost of goods sold from the actual cost of goods sold, and divide the result by the standard cost of goods sold. By using this approach, the aggregate cost of what was produced can be compared to what should have been produced, without having to resort to a detailed count of each item scrapped. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13034.gif" alt=" " width="346" height="40"/></p><p class="para">A variation on this formula is to track only the scrap generated by the bottleneck production operation. This is especially important because the scrap lost through this operation must be manufactured again, which may interfere with the production of other goods that must pass through the same operation, thereby possibly reducing the total amount of gross margin generated by the factory.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The production manager of the Pelican Lawn Products Company wants to calculate the scrap percentage of his manufacturing facility, and therefore accumulates the following information:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Actual direct labor</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$145,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Actual direct materials</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">580,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Actual overhead</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">870,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Standard direct labor</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">142,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Standard direct materials</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">542,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Standard overhead</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">745,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Standard scrap</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">12,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The production manager wants to exclude overhead costs from the calculation in order to concentrate on just those costs most directly related to scrap. There is some standard scrap built into the standard direct materials costs; the production manager wants to determine the total amount of scrap being produced, so this item is eliminated from the standard cost of goods sold. The resulting calculation is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13035.gif" alt=" " width="476" height="184"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> There are several problems with comparing the actual cost of goods sold to the standard amount and assuming that the difference is scrap. One problem is that there may be a standard scrap value already included in the bills of materials that compose the standard cost of goods sold, so these values must be extracted from the standard so as to determine the actual amount of scrap. A third problem is that there may be other variances contained within the actual cost of goods sold, such as a price variance on raw materials purchased. These variances must be calculated and removed from the actual cost of goods sold before the amount of scrap can be determined. Another problem is that many of the costs that make up the cost of goods sold are related to overhead, rather than the direct cost associated with scrap. To prevent this problem, include in the cost of goods sold only the direct labor and direct materials costs associated with production, removing all overhead costs. Finally, the inherent assumption in this formula is that standard costs are reasonably accurate; if not, the resulting scrap calculation will be incorrect.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0022">FIRST-TIME-THROUGH YIELD</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The ability of a production process to manufacture products without error represents a core strength of a company, since it implies very little scrap, rework, or other forms of waste in the production area. The first-time-through yield metric is used to track this capability. Consider calculating it very frequently, perhaps as often as once an hour, to immediately highlight issues that are causing the yield rate to fall. Management should address any issues uncovered at once so the company does not lose any more money due to continuing yield problems.</p><p class="para">This measurement can also be applied in the services industries by substituting rework, warranty claims, or other customer service issues for the defective units normally used in the calculation.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Subtract the number of defective units produced from the total number of units produced and divide by the number of units produced.

If so, consider initially running the measurement for just one work center, and then gradually rolling it out throughout the manufacturing area.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0023">WARRANTY CLAIMS PERCENTAGE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Warranty claims can be caused by a poor product design, the use of raw materials having inadequate specifications, or improper production. It can therefore be used to rate the performance of the engineering, logistics, and production departments. When warranty claims are high, this becomes a valuable tool for judging the quality of a company's products.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total number of warranty claims received by the total number of products sold. Since there may be a significant time lag between the date when a warranty claim is received and the date of production, it is best to accumulate this information over a number of months on a rolling basis so there is a reasonable basis of comparison between the two numbers. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13038.gif" alt=" " width="272" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The production manager of the Lullaby Swing Company is trying to determine the warranty claims percentage for its Baby Care Swing product. The company manufactured this product through the six months leading up to the summer selling season, after which it stopped production and does not plan to begin again until the end of the year. A rash of warranty claims were filed toward the end of the summer that appear to be caused by a structural defect in the swing joint that causes collapse after heavy usage. The total number of units produced was 183,000, and the number of claims filed thus far is 1,897. The calculation is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13039.gif" alt=" " width="285" height="129"/></p><p class="para">This is a common situation involving the calculation of warranty claims as a measurement and is deserving of continued review over several years to determine whether problems continue to arise with this product. The production manager should consider marking the product differently in each successive year so that returned products can be easily associated with a specific production year.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As noted in the Description section for this measurement, warranty problems can be caused by the production, engineering, and logistics departments, so using this measure to judge the performance of just the production department may be ignoring the true problem-causing departments. Also, when a company sells its products through intermediaries, such as large retail chains or distributors, these entities may sometimes use the warranty claims process as an excuse for returning unsold products that have no defects at all. For both of these reasons, incoming warranty items should be carefully reviewed to determine the true cause of problems before calculating the warranty claims percentage.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0024">MAINTENANCE EXPENSE TO FIXED ASSETS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The ability of the production function to operate at its maximum levels of productivity is strongly influenced by the amount of investment that a company is willing to make in the ongoing repair and maintenance of its fixed assets, most of which tend to be concentrated in the production area. Accordingly, a high ratio of maintenance expense to fixed assets, especially on an increasing trend line or in relation to the industry average, is evidence of this commitment.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total amount of maintenance and repair expense by the total gross amount of fixed assets. It would be useful to more precisely determine the amount of repairs and maintenance that are devoted just to the production function, but this is not normally broken out in the chart of accounts; the total amount of production equipment is typically listed separately in the general ledger, so the denominator could be restricted to just the amount of fixed assets related to production. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13040.gif" alt=" " width="212" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> A production manager wishes to determine that portion of the maintenance expense to fixed assets ratio that pertains just to his department.

The production manager consequently uses only the production maintenance expense in the numerator of the calculation. Of the assets, all the machinery assets are assumed to belong in the production department. The resulting ratio is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13041.gif" alt=" " width="322" height="135"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This can be a misleading measurement if not also used in conjunction with some measure of fixed asset replacement, because the amount of maintenance and repair costs will also be high if the underlying base of fixed assets has not been replaced on a regular basis. If there is no information available about fixed asset replacement, then an alternative approach is to split the amount of maintenance and repair expenses into its labor and materials components. A high components portion (especially if it is increasing on a trend line) is a reasonable indication of equipment failures on old equipment that require significant replacement work.</p><p class="para">Another issue is that some repairs are of a singular nature and will not recur for some time. For example, a roof replacement may be required only once every decade. If there are sudden spikes in the trend line of maintenance and expense repairs, they may be indicators of these unusual items, which can then be excluded from the ratio.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0025">INDIRECT EXPENSE INDEX</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> In companies that have established a steady market share and have predictable and repeatable expenses (as is found in mature markets), the indirect expense index is a useful tool for spotting changes in indirect expenses as they relate to the overall level of production. In established markets, there is usually a consistent relationship between the amount of indirect expenses incurred and the volume of production. When there is a change in this relationship, the indirect expense index can be used to bring it to the attention of management.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total of all indirect production expenses in period two by the number of units produced in the same period. Then divide the total of all indirect production expenses in period one by the number of units produced in the same period, and divide this into the calculation for period two. By comparing the results for two consecutive periods, it can be easily seen whether the relationship between indirect expenses and units of production is rising or falling. Any number greater than 1 represents an increase in per-unit indirect costs over the prior period. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13042.gif" alt=" " width="439" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The new production manager of InCase Manufacturing, which manufactures injection-molded CD cases, needs to find out what areas to review following the firing of the previous manager for not controlling spiraling costs.

For example, a manufacturer of Christmas ornaments may experience extremely high production volumes in the months preceding Christmas, but nothing directly thereafter. In these cases, the periods being compared in the indirect expense index should be the latest month and the same month in the previous year, which should presumably have experienced the same ratio of indirect expenses to units of production.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0026">REORDER POINT</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The reorder point can be used as a valid measurement by the production or logistics department. It shows the point at which an order for more parts should be placed, assuming that some reserve of parts is kept on hand as a safety stock.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Multiply the average usage per period by the ordering lead time, and then add a predetermined amount for safety stock. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13043.gif" alt=" " width="381" height="14"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The Open Sesame Door Company purchases large quantities of door kick plates from a brass supplier. The production manager's performance rating has suffered from the lack of this item in the past, since running out of it has brought production to a complete halt. The production manager needs a reorder point that ensures that the company never runs out of kick plates again. The relevant information for the last six months of production is shown in <a id="c13-tbl-0011-1" href="#c13-tbl-0011">Table 13.11</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c13-tbl-0011" href="#c13-tbl-0011-1">TABLE 13.11</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top"><span class="bold">Month</span></td><td class="bodycell" valign="top"><span class="bold">Kick Plate Usage</span></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">January</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1,258</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">February</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">542</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">March</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1,602</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">April</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">770</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">May</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">894</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">June</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1,195</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Average usage</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1,044</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">If the production manager simply orders the average amount of usage of 1,044 kick plates in each month, then there would not have been enough of them on hand to meet production requirements in January, March, and June. To avoid this problem, the manager must add safety stock to the average usage figure. To ensure that production needs are met, a safety stock figure must be added that is the difference between the average usage and the maximum usage. In this case, the maximum usage was in March, when 1,602 kick plates were needed. The difference between the maximum of 1,602 and the average usage of 1,044 is 558, which becomes the safety stock. Thus far, it appears that the safety stock should be 1,602 units, which is also the maximum amount of usage that can be expected during the year.</p><p class="para">However, the production manager does not wish to invest so heavily in raw materials. The average lead time for purchases of kick plates is five business days, or one-quarter of a month. With this information, the manager realizes that orders can be placed four times a month, thereby reducing the amount of kick plates kept on hand; also, she needs only one quarter of the safety stock. Accordingly, the manager modifies the calculation for the short lead time in the following manner:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13044.gif" alt=" " width="426" height="96"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measurement is based solely on the concept of purchasing with historical usage information. The concept is fine as long as the amount of product manufactured is always the same. However, the production process will be jeopardized if there is a sudden surge in the volume of required production, since this will overwhelm the amount of inventory left on hand as safety stock and will then bring production to a halt because of a lack of materials. To avoid this problem, use a more precise order planning system, such as a manufacturing resources planning (MRP II) system.</p><p class="para">Another issue is that the reorder point is based on the assumption of continuing usage of a part but does not account for the termination of a part. For example, the engineering staff may be planning to replace a part with a different, less expensive item. Unless someone manually eliminates the reorder point calculation for this part, the system will recommend placing an order that will keep the company fully stocked with the part, even though it is no longer needed. Again, a fully functional MRP II system will eliminate this problem by accounting for the planned obsolescence of parts.</p><p class="para">Yet another problem is that the lead time may vary based on the supplier used as well as the time of year (since suppliers may suffer from surges in orders at high-volume times of the year). Consequently, the reorder point cannot be used blindly, but rather in concert with an ongoing effort to verify lead times with suppliers.</p><p class="h1" id="c13-sec1-0027">ON-TIME DELIVERY RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Though on-time delivery can be considered a logistics function, a product cannot be delivered until the production department has manufactured it. Consequently, this is a reasonable measurement to use for the production department. This is a key determinant of customer satisfaction and should be used by any company that ships products to customers. Those that provide services will probably not need it.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of orders shipped on or before the customers' required due dates by the total number of orders shipped. A less restrictive measure is to use the <span class="italic">adjusted</span> customer-required due dates; these are typically dates that the company has persuaded customers to adopt, given the company's availability of materials and productive capacity. A more restrictive variation is to use as a customer due date the date of delivery that will ensure the customer receives the product by its mandated due date. The basic formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13045.gif" alt=" " width="242" height="40"/></p><p class="para">A variation on the measurement is to divide the dollar value of orders shipped on or before the customers' due date by the total dollar value of orders shipped. However, this measure can be strongly skewed by the presence of a few large orders, so that a company appears to have an excellent on-time delivery ratio, despite shipping many smaller orders late. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu13046.gif" alt=" " width="267" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The entire production staff of the Del Ray Scuba Company is paid a bonus when it achieves an 85% on-time delivery ratio at the end of each month. This manufacturer of aluminum and steel dive tanks ships tanks to dive shops all over the world, which can involve long shipping times. The on-time delivery ratio calculation subtracts the transit time from the required customer due date so as to determine the date by which orders must be shipped. In May, the production department recorded the performance shown in <a id="c13-tbl-0012-1" href="#c13-tbl-0012">Table 13.12</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c13-tbl-0012" href="#c13-tbl-0012-1">TABLE 13.12</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table13012.gif" alt="" width="557" height="168"/><p class="para">According to the table, the production department missed a delivery date for a shipment to Undersea Adventures in Palau. This order required a long eight-day delivery time because of the customer's location in the western Pacific Ocean. Consequently, five of the six orders were shipped on time, which is an on-time delivery percentage of 83%. The production department will not be paid a bonus for its May deliveries.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This measure is commonly used as a key measure of performance, and so can be a determinant of bonuses paid to the production and logistics staffs. For this reason, there is a high probability that the underlying customer order information will be altered to ensure that an acceptable ratio is achieved. This can be done by accessing customer order records and altering the due date. This problem can be avoided by restricting access to the order date with password protection. Also, if the measurement is set up to record a shipment date that is a few days before the actual customer due date (in order to account for transit time), the production staff may take a liberal view of the amount of transit time required. For example, to give itself more time to manufacture a product, the production staff may assume that a shipment will only require one day to reach the customer, even though it is located thousands of miles away. To prevent this problem, there should be a standard policy dictating the number of assumed transit days for different distances at which customers are located from the production facility, and which are used to determine the required shipment date. This issue can also give rise to the use of expensive overnight delivery services so as to shrink the transit time and get products to customers by their required due dates.</p></div></div>
