It covers not just the popular price/earnings ratio, but also other issues that affect earnings on a per-share basis, such as several variations on the stock options to common shares ratio. It also addresses several capital-based measures, such as market value added and the cost of capital, which are driven by the equity and debt markets' perception of a company's valuation. The measurements discussed in this chapter are:</p><table class="bodytable" border="0"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell">Insider Stock Buy-Sell Ratio<br/>Institutional Capture Rate<br/>Market Value Added<br/>Enterprise Value/Earnings Ratio<br/>Stock Options to Common Shares Ratio</td><td class="bodycell">Cost of Capital<br/>Sales to Stock Price Ratio<br/>Price/Earnings Ratio<br/>Capitalization Rate</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="h1" id="c08-sec1-0001">INSIDER STOCK BUY-SELL RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio is used by outside analysts to determine whether company employees are aware of information that is not available to the public, which may lead a disproportionate number of them to buy or sell stock in expectation of changes in company value. For some stock traders, this is a key part of their stock-pricing models.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the number of stock <span class="italic">sale</span> transactions by company insiders by the number of stock <span class="italic">purchase</span> transactions by company insiders. If the resulting percentage is less than one, then the presumption is that insiders feel the company's value will increase. Conversely, a percentage greater than one indicates a rapid sell-off of stock, possibly caused by pessimism over the company's future prospects. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08001.gif" alt=" " width="325" height="40"/></p><p class="para">Since the number of stock transactions used in this formula can be skewed by a large number of small transactions, the calculation can be modified so that it is based on the total number of shares sold and purchased. Yet another variation is to calculate it based on the transactions of high-level company officers only, who are likely to best understand the condition of the company.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> An investment analyst watches the results of the Hardaway Hair Dryer Company on a regular basis. The analyst is trying to sort out some insider stock transactions that have recently occurred to see if there is a trend to use to make a recommendation to clients. The relevant information is shown in <a id="c8-tbl-001-1" href="#c8-tbl-001">Table 8.1</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c8-tbl-001" href="#c8-tbl-001-1">TABLE 8.1</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table08001.gif" alt=" " width="557" height="163"/><p class="para">By summarizing the information in the table and calculating the insider stock buy-sell ratio, the analyst arrives at the following measurement:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08002.gif" alt=" " width="338" height="101"/></p><p class="para">At first glance, it appears that there is a trend toward the purchase of shares by company insiders. However, a careful review of the specific transactions is in order. One of the purchases was made by the company's employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), which probably purchases shares on an ongoing basis irrespective of the stock price. Also, two of the purchases, by the marketing director and engineering staff, are so small that they may be related to the exercise of stock options. Counterbalancing these purchases are sales by the CFO, assistant controller, and sales manager. Not only are these stock sales larger in quantity, they were also made by those employees who have the best knowledge of financial information. Since several of these sales are clustered near the beginning of November, it is possible that some poor initial financial results for October were received that caused them to sell shares. This leaves the purchase of shares by the CEO: this was the last stock purchase of the year, and the last one before a conference call with investors. It is possible that the CEO calculated the number of shares sold and bought exactly enough shares to offset them, thereby putting him in the position of stating that insider purchases and sales for the period were exactly neutral. Based on this more detailed review, the investment analyst should suspect that financial results for the quarter will not be good.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The problem with this measurement is that insider buy and sell transactions can occur for reasons other than the participants' perception of company value. For example, stockholders may sell stock based on an immediate need for cash. Also, option holders may decide to cash in their shares before leaving the company. Furthermore, stock purchases may be based on bargain purchase options that make stock an extremely attractive deal for the buyers even if the market price is not good at all. Given the number of conflicting factors that drive insider stock transactions, this measure is more useful to spot broad trends in purchases or sell-offs that override any of the reasons noted here for buying or selling stock.</p><p class="h1" id="c08-sec1-0002">INSTITUTIONAL CAPTURE RATE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> A publicly held company may target certain types of investors to acquire its stock. A common objective is to sell blocks of stock to institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies. The assumption in doing so is that these entities will hold the company's stock for a moderately long period of time, and so tend to calm the price volatility of the stock. While it is not always clear that institutional investors actually retain stock positions for long, it may still be worthwhile to measure the proportion of shares held by them. We measure this with the institutional capture rate (ICR).</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the absolute number of shares bought or sold by institutional investors into the total trading volume over a three-month measurement period. The institutional investor activity comes from their quarterly 13F filings; since the 13F information is updated only on a quarterly basis, this is the reason for measuring only ICR on the same quarterly basis. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08003.gif" alt=" " width="432" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> Excelsior Products has experienced a considerable amount of stock volatility since it went public. In an effort to reduce the level of volatility, the company's investor relations officer has conducted numerous road shows to increase the company's exposure with institutional investors. The following table shows the change in the institutional capture rate before and after the road shows:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top"></td><td class="bodycell" valign="top"><span class="bold">Before Road Show</span></td><td class="bodycell" valign="top"><span class="bold">After Road Show</span></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total trading volume</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">40,000,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">48,000,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Institution investor activity</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">2,500,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">7,000,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Institutional capture rate</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">6%</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">15%</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The key underlying assumption of this metric is that it is good to have activity from institutional investors. This is not necessarily the case, since some institutions flip their investments quite rapidly, thereby adding to the volatility of the stock. Thus, it is more important to have only those institutional investors who have a track record of maintaining their stock holdings for an extended time.</p><p class="h1" id="c08-sec1-0003">MARKET VALUE ADDED</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This measurement shows the net difference between a company's market value and the cost of its invested capital. A negative amount indicates that management has done a poor job of creating value with the base of equity available to it, since investors have reduced the company's value below the amount of equity invested.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Multiply the number of common shares outstanding by their current market price. Then multiply the number of preferred shares outstanding by their market price, and add the result to the total market value for all common stock; then subtract from it the original amount of invested capital. When deriving this calculation, be sure to use only the number of shares outstanding exclusive of any treasury stock. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08004.gif" alt=" " width="511" height="33"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The CFO of a company that trades on the Nasdaq is preparing a statement for investors, showing the increase in value that the management team has provided to investors during the past year. This statement will include the market value added measurement. The CFO obtains the information shown in <a id="c8-tbl-002-1" href="#c8-tbl-002">Table 8.2</a>.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c8-tbl-002" href="#c8-tbl-002-1">TABLE 8.2</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top"></td><td class="bodycell" valign="top"><span class="bold">Prior Year</span></td><td class="bodycell" valign="top"><span class="bold">Current Year</span></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Number of common shares outstanding</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">3,500,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">4,000,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Common stock price</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$5.12</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$7.03</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Number of preferred shares outstanding</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">467,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">525,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Preferred share price</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$14.00</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$14.93</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Book value of invested capital</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$20,000,000</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$24,300,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">She calculates the prior year market value added:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08005.gif" alt=" " width="493" height="112"/></p><p class="para">Using the same formula, the CFO calculates the market value added for the current year as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08006.gif" alt=" " width="493" height="111"/></p><p class="para">The CFO can point out to investors that there is a net gain in market value added of $7.2 million in the past year, which is an increase of 161% over the past year.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> This calculation is a difficult one to make if a company's stock is either not publicly held or thinly traded, since it is difficult to obtain a market value for any outstanding shares. Even if shares are publicly held, it is possible that some classes of stock are so restricted, such as special voting stock among a few shareholders, that it is impossible to determine the value of these classes. This problem can be reduced by obtaining an outside valuation from an appraiser or by consistently using any of a number of valuation techniques, such as the present value of cash flows, a multiple of sales, or the fair market value of net assets.</p><p class="para">Also, an increase in market value may be caused by a general run-up in the entire stock market, rather than any particular actions by the management team to improve company value; in a strong bull or bear market, this issue can make up the bulk of any changes in the market value added measure. Also, perceived investor changes on an entire industry (such as changes in the price of jet fuel on the airline industry) can cause investors to drive the stock price of an individual company within that industry up or down, despite its having positioned itself to be immune from the changes that are driving investor behavior.</p><p class="h1" id="c08-sec1-0004">ENTERPRISE VALUE/EARNINGS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Enterprise value (EV) measures what it would cost to buy an entire public company, which would include buying all outstanding shares and paying off its debt. When divided by earnings, this ratio becomes useful for comparing the value of companies with different capital structures, which are not easily comparable when using the more common price/earnings ratio.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Multiply the company's total shares by their stock price, add its debt, and subtract its holdings of cash and marketable securities to arrive at the total cost to buy the company. Since all debt is now assumed to have been paid off, subtract interest expense from the company's reported net income. Then divide EV by the adjusted net earnings figure. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08007.gif" alt=" " width="424" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> An analyst is comparing the values of two hardware store chains, Nuts 'n' Bolts and its archrival, Handyman Helper. The stock price and net earnings of the two companies are shown in <a id="c8-tbl-003-1" href="#c8-tbl-003">Table 8.3</a>, resulting in a higher price/earnings ratio for Nuts 'n' Bolts.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c8-tbl-003" href="#c8-tbl-003-1">TABLE 8.3</a></span></p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top"></td><td class="bodycell" valign="top"><span class="bold">Handyman Helper</span></td><td class="bodycell" valign="top"><span class="bold">Nuts 'n' Bolts</span></td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Stock price</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$17.00</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$23.00</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Earnings per share</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$2.15</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$2.75</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Price/earnings ratio</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">7.9</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">8.4</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">The capital structures of the two firms are radically different.

To expand upon the concept, consider reversing the ratio by dividing the EV into adjusted earnings. Doing this results in the earnings percentage that an investor should expect to obtain after having bought a company.</p><p class="h1" id="c08-sec1-0005">STOCK OPTIONS TO COMMON SHARES RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Investment analysts are very interested in this measurement, for it tells them how many additional shares may be issued to the holders of stock options, which in turn will water down the earnings per share for the holders of existing shares. A high percentage of outstanding options to common shares indicates a potential problem. As noted in the formula section, however, the basic formula includes all options, even those that are unlikely to be converted into stock. More precise versions of the measurement that eliminate this issue are therefore included in the formula section.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the total number of stock options granted by the total number of common shares outstanding. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08008.gif" alt=" " width="223" height="40"/></p><p class="para">Though this formula gives a general idea of the number of shares that may be converted eventually through the exercise of options, a great many of them may never be exercised because the time is nowhere near the period when they vest. Accordingly, the following more restrictive measurement may be used, which includes only vested stock options:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08009.gif" alt=" " width="223" height="40"/></p><p class="para">Even if options have been vested, there may be little chance they will be exercised, since the designated stock purchase price is above the current market price. Accordingly, the most restrictive variation on the formula includes only those options that are in the money. This calculation is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08010.gif" alt=" " width="223" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> An investment analyst for a large cruise ship line wants to calculate the stock options to common shares ratio to determine if there is a prospect of significant dilution in earnings per share. The analyst obtains the following information:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total shares outstanding</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">42,500,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total options granted</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">5,250,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total options vested</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">1,250,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total options vesting in one year</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">3,000,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total options vesting in two years</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">250,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total options vesting in three years</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">750,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Total vested options in the money</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">100,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">If all the outstanding options were used as the numerator in the calculation, an options-to-common shares ratio of 12.4% would be derived, which is calculated as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08011.gif" alt=" " width="448" height="39"/></p><p class="para">However, only 100,000 of these options are in the money, which is a minuscule 0.2% of the total number of shares outstanding, and so small as to have no impact on earnings per share. An additional issue is that the bulk of all unvested shares will be vested in one year, which will result in a ratio of vested shares to common stock of 4,250,000 vested options to 42,500,000 common shares, or 10%. Accordingly, the analyst should report to investors the minimal short-term impact of options, but add the comment that this could change in one year when many more options become vested. An additional issue that the analyst should explore is whether the newly vested shares will be in the money based on their designated exercise prices.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> It is best to use all three versions of the measurement for the best perspective on the full range of possible dilutions. For example, if only the most restrictive measurement, which uses the total number of shares in the money, were tracked, then it might come as a surprise if the market price of the stock suddenly jumps, thereby throwing a potentially large number of vested stock options into the money and altering the measurement. Furthermore, if only the measurement that included vested stock options were used, then it would be a surprise when the vesting date for a large new batch of options was reached, thereby shifting additional vested options into the measurement.</p><p class="h1" id="c08-sec1-0006">COST OF CAPITAL</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The cost of capital is the blended cost of debt and equity that a company has acquired so it can fund its operations. It is important, because a company's investment decisions related to new operations should always result in a return that exceeds its cost of capital; if not, then the company is not generating a return for its investors.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> The cost of capital is composed of the costs of debt, preferred stock, and common stock. The formula for the cost of capital is composed of separate calculations for all three of these items, which must then be combined to derive the total cost of capital on a weighted average basis. To derive the cost of debt, multiply the interest expense associated with the debt by the inverse of the tax rate percentage, and divide the result by the amount of debt outstanding. The amount of debt outstanding that is used in the denominator should include any transactional fees associated with the acquisition of the debt as well as any premiums or discounts on sale of the debt. These fees, premiums, or discounts should be gradually amortized over the life of the debt, so that the amount included in the denominator will decrease over time. The formula for the cost of debt is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08012.gif" alt=" " width="500" height="40"/></p><p class="para">The cost of preferred stock is a simpler calculation, since interest payments made on this form of funding are not tax-deductible. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08013.gif" alt=" " width="170" height="40"/></p><p class="para">The calculation of the cost of common stock requires a different type of calculation. It is composed of three types of return: a risk-free return, an average rate of return to be expected from a typical broad-based group of stocks, and a differential return based on the risk of the specific stock in comparison to the larger group of stocks. The risk-free rate of return is derived from the return on a U.S. government security. The average rate of return can be derived from any large cluster of stocks, such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 or the Dow Jones Industrials. The return related to risk is called a stock's <span class="italic">beta</span>; it is regularly calculated and published by several investment services for publicly held companies, such as Value Line. A beta value of less than one indicates a level of rate-of-return risk that is lower than average while a beta greater than one would indicate an increasing degree of risk in the rate of return. Given these components, the formula for the cost of common stock is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08014.gif" alt=" " width="440" height="14"/></p><p class="para">Once all of these calculations have been made, they must be combined on a weighted average basis to derive the blended cost of capital for a company. This is accomplished by multiplying the cost of each item by the amount of outstanding funding associated with it:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08015.gif" alt=" " width="510" height="101"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> An investment analyst wants to determine the cost of capital of the Jolt Electric Company to ascertain whether it is generating returns that exceed its cost of capital. The return it reported for its last fiscal year was 11.8%. The company's bonds are currently priced on the open market at a total price of $50,800,000, its preferred stock at $12,875,000, and its common stock at $72,375,000. Its incremental tax rate is 34%. It pays $4,625,000 in interest on its bonds, and there is an unamortized debt premium of $1,750,000 currently on the company's books. The preferred stock pays interest of $1,030,000. The risk-free rate of return is 5%, the return on the Dow Jones Industrials is 12%, and Jolt's beta is 1.5. To calculate Jolt's cost of capital, first determine its cost of debt, which is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08016.gif" alt=" " width="421" height="42"/></p><p class="para">The investment analyst then proceeds to the cost of preferred stock, which is calculated as:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08017.gif" alt=" " width="237" height="36"/></p><p class="para">Finally, the analyst calculates the cost of common stock, which is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08018.gif" alt=" " width="358" height="35"/></p><p class="para">The analyst then creates the weighted-average table shown in <a id="c8-tbl-005-1" href="#c8-tbl-005">Table 8.5</a> to determine the combined cost of capital for Jolt.</p><p class="tablecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c8-tbl-005" href="#c8-tbl-005-1">TABLE 8.5</a></span></p><img src="../OEBPS/images/table08005.gif" alt=" " width="559" height="107"/><p class="para">Based on these calculations, Jolt's return of 11.8% is a marginal improvement over its cost of capital of 11.2%.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> The dollar value of the preferred stock and common stock used in this calculation is based on the current market price of these items instead of the price at which they were originally sold. The market rate can help to accurately determine the assumed rate of return that investors are expecting at the moment; this is much preferable to using the book rate for either item, since this fixes the rate of return at the time when the shares were originally sold and gives no indication of current market expectations.</p><p class="h1" id="c08-sec1-0007">SALES TO STOCK PRICE RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> This ratio indicates the opinion of investors regarding a company's ability to increase its sales volume. If sales increase and there is no change in the stock price, then the rate of growth in sales falls within the expectations of investors. If there is an increase in the stock price, then sales have exceeded their expectations; a drop in the stock price is indicative of sales levels that do not meet their expectations.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide annualized net sales by the average common stock price for the reporting period. The annualized net sales figure used in this calculation should be the prospective sales figure for the current reporting year, since this represents the announced sales figure that company management has released to investors, and it is the number on which they are basing their decisions to buy or hold the stock. The average common stock price should be used instead of the ending stock price, since this removes some fluctuation from the price.</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08019.gif" alt=" " width="187" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> The president of the Gonging Clock Company has been given a stock compensation package that will be richly rewarding if the stock price doubles within one year. The president elects to do so by focusing solely on increases in sales. The display clocks that the company produces are sold almost entirely within the Christmas selling season. To increase sales, the president allows customers to pay for their clocks within 180 days, instead of the usual 30 days, and also offers discounts for bulk purchases. As a result, the company experiences a massive increase in sales, investors bid up the stock price, and the president retires with a large stock bonus. Unfortunately, the president's actions so thoroughly clog the company's distribution pipeline with product that its sales volume in the following year dives down to less than one-quarter of the sales level of the preceding year. The board of directors learns its lesson from this experience and subsequently revises its senior management incentive plan to focus on more long-term value objectives.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> A stock's price is influenced by a number of variables besides sales, such as the general trend of the stock market, profitability, and the general perception of investors in regard to the prospects of the industry in which the company is located. For example, if the price of aviation fuel goes up, the price of airline stocks will likely go down because of the perception that this cost increase will reduce airline profits. Consequently, the overall correlation between sales and stock price is not perfect.</p><p class="h1" id="c08-sec1-0008">PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> Comparing earnings to the current market price of the stock gives a general idea of the perception of investors of the quality of corporate earnings. For example, a ratio that is substantially lower than the average rate for the industry could indicate an expectation among investors that a company's future earnings are expected to trend lower. Alternatively, a high ratio could indicate the excitement of investors over a new patent that a company has just been granted or the expected favorable results of a lawsuit—the possible explanations are legion. The key point when using this ratio is that a result that varies from the industry average probably indicates a change in investor perceptions from the rest of the industry in regard to a company's ability to continue to generate income.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide the average common stock price by the net income per share. The net income per share figure is typically used on a fully diluted basis, accounting for the impact of options, warrants, and conversions from debt that may increase the number of shares outstanding. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08020.gif" alt=" " width="187" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> An investment analyst wants to determine the price/earnings ratio for the Mile-High Dirigible Company. The industry average price/earnings ratio for lighter-than-air transport manufacturers is 18:1. The analyst accumulates the following information:</p><table class="bodycell" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Most recent stock price</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$32.87</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Number of shares outstanding</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">3,875,000</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Net income</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$8,500,000.00</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell" valign="top">Extraordinary income</td><td class="bodycell" valign="top">$2,250,000.00</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="para">If the analyst chooses to leave the extraordinary amount in the total net income figure, then the following calculation will be used to derive the price/earnings ratio:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08021.gif" alt=" " width="516" height="37"/></p><p class="para">So far, the price/earnings ratio appears to compare favorably to the industry average. However, if the analyst excludes the extraordinary gain from net income, the earnings per share figure drops to $1.61 per share. When incorporated into the price/earnings formula, this change increases the ratio to 20:1, which is higher than the industry average. Accordingly, the analyst considers the stock to be overpriced relative to the industry and refrains from recommending it to clients.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> If a stock tends to fluctuate widely over the short term, it is difficult to arrive at an average common stock price that yields a valid price/earnings ratio. In such cases, it is better to calculate the price/earnings ratio with the most current common stock price as the numerator and view it on a trend line to monitor changes.</p><p class="para">Another issue is that the net income figure can be significantly altered by the presence of large reserves or extraordinary items that skew operating results. In these cases, it is better to examine the underlying financial reports, determine the net income from operations, and use that number as the net income figure in the measurement.</p><p class="para">Yet another issue is that the stock price is based on a number of factors besides net income, such as an industry-wide drop in revenue prospects, legal action against the company, well-publicized warranty claims, the presence of valuable patents, and so on. These factors may result in a stock price that is substantially different from what would otherwise be the case if only net income were the driving factor behind the stock price.</p><p class="h1" id="c08-sec1-0009">CAPITALIZATION RATE</p><p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="bolditalic">Description:</span> The capitalization rate is simply the reverse of the price/earnings ratio. It can be used in concert with the price/earnings ratio to see what the implied rate of return is on a company's stock, given the price at which its shares currently sell on the open market.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Formula:</span> Divide earnings per share by the market price per share. The net income per share figure is typically used on a fully diluted basis, accounting for the impact of options, warrants, and conversions from debt that may increase the number of shares outstanding. If the capitalization rate measurement is being used to decide whether to purchase or sell stock, brokerage and other fees required to complete the transaction should be included in the calculation. The formula is:</p><p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/eqnu08022.gif" alt=" " width="145" height="40"/></p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Example:</span> An investor is interested in buying the stock of a high-tech company that specializes in the production of wireless Internet connections. This company's stock has experienced a considerable run-up over the past few months, and the investor is concerned that it may have gone too high to be a valid investment. Its earnings per share are $2.18, and its stock price is $159.14. This means that its capitalization rate is 1.4% ($2.18 earnings per share, divided by $159.14 stock price), which represents a return on investment of 1.4%. The investor therefore considers the stock to be too expensive and elects to wait for its price to drop before making an investment.</p><p class="para"><span class="bolditalic">Cautions:</span> As was the case for the price/earnings ratio, the capitalization rate can be skewed by the presence of extraordinary items that do not properly reflect the earnings stream from operations. If the proportion of extraordinary charges or income in the earnings per share figure is significant, then these should be stripped away, leaving earnings from operations in the numerator of the formula.</p></div></div>
