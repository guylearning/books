These funds have to be paid for at the market rate. Payment can come only from the operating surplus derived from the efficient use of the assets. It is by relating this surplus to the value of the underlying assets/funds that we find a measure of return on investment.</p><p>If this return on investment is equal to or greater than the cost of funds, then the business is currently viable. However, if the long-term rate is less than the cost of funds, the business has no long-term future. In any particular instance, this generic term ‘ROI’ will be expressed by one of the more specific terms, ROTA, ROE, etc.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/hand.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>From the balance sheet we get asset figures and from the profit/loss account we get operating surplus. We relate these two to establish the rate of return.</p><p>We have already seen the beginnings of this concept in <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Profit and loss account">chapters 4</a> and <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Measures of performance">5</a>, but in this chapter we examine it more deeply. The concept of return on investment is universal, but the methods of measurement vary widely.</p><p>This lack of consistency causes confusion in the minds of many financial and non-financial people alike.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lev2sec1"></a>Two measures of return on investment</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1705" class="indexterm"></a>The two complementary approaches to return on investment that we have already met with will be developed in depth.

Return on total assets looks at the operating efficiency of the total enterprise, while return on equity considers how that operating efficiency is translated into benefit to the owners. This chapter will concentrate on these two areas. First we will look at methods of calculation, using the Example Co. plc accounts to explore them. Then we will use the aggregated accounts of the US Consolidated Company Inc. to establish what values can be expected from successful businesses.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lev1sec2"></a>Return on equity (ROE)</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html#ch06fig01" title="Figure 6.1. Return on equity ratio applied to data from the Example Co. plc">Figure 6.1</a> shows how return on equity is calculated.

It measures the absolute return delivered to the shareholders. A good figure brings success to the business – it results in a high share price and makes it easy to attract new funds. These will enable the company to grow, given suitable market conditions, and this in turn leads to greater profits and so on. All this leads to high value and continued growth in the wealth of its owners.</p></div><p>At the level of the individual business, a good return on equity will keep in place the financial framework for a thriving, growing enterprise. At the level of the total economy, return on equity drives industrial investment, growth in gross national product, employment, government tax receipts and so on.</p><p>It is, therefore, a critical feature of the overall modern market economy as well as of individual companies.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lev1sec3"></a>Return on total assets (ROTA)</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1315" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1715" class="indexterm"></a>Return on total assets provides the foundation necessary for a company to deliver a good return on equity. A company without a good ROTA finds it almost impossibe to generate a satisfactory ROE. <a class="link" href="ch06.html#ch06fig02" title="Figure 6.2. Return on total assets ratio applied to data from the Example Co. plc">Figure 6.2</a> shows how ROTA is calculated, i.e. EBIT/TA.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch06fig02"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c06nf002_1.gif" width="500" alt="Return on total assets ratio applied to data from the Example Co. plc"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 6.2. Return on total assets ratio applied to data from the Example Co. plc</strong></p></div></div><p>EBIT is the amount remaining when total operating cost is deducted from total revenue, but before either interest or tax have been paid. Total operating cost includes direct factory cost, plus administration, selling and distribution overheads.</p><p>This operating profit figure is set against the total assets figure in the balance sheet. The percentage relationship between the two values gives the rate of return being earned by the total assets. Therefore this ratio measures how well management uses all the assets in the business to generate an operating surplus.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/face.jpg" width="37" alt="Return on total assets ratio applied to data from the Example Co. plc"/></div><p><span class="italic">Some practitioners contend that the figure taken from the balance sheet should include the long-term funds and only those short-term funds for which a charge is made, i.e. STL (short-term loans). Their position is that assets funded by ‘free’ creditors should not be included in the rate of return calculation. There is considerable merit in this argument, but a counter argument is that the rate of return issue is separate from the funding issue and that assets should produce a return irrespective of the method of funding. For example, some companies choose to fund by suppliers’ credit, others from a bank loan. The author’s view is that, for most companies, the balance of advantage lies with the latter school of thought.</span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt="Return on total assets ratio applied to data from the Example Co. plc"/></div><p>Whichever method of calculation is adopted, return on total assets uses the three main operating variables of the business:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>total revenue</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>total cost</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>assets utilized (some definition of).</p></li></ul></div><p>It is therefore the most comprehensive measure of total management performance available to us.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lev1sec4"></a>Standards of operating performance</h1></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="Standards of operating performance"/></div><p><a id="iddle1601" class="indexterm"></a><a class="link" href="ch06.html#ch06fig03" title="Figure 6.3. Summary balance sheet and profit and loss account for the US Consolidated Company Inc. 2000">Figure 6.3</a> shows a summary balance sheet and profit and loss account for the US Consolidated Company Inc. in 2000.

They are obviously all very good performers and are the gold medallists, as it were, of US industry.</p><p>This is not to say that, because they are the largest, they are the most profitable. Indeed better results are often produced by smaller businesses. However, to reach their pre-eminent position, these companies have consistently produced good results, they have survived and grown over many years.</p><p>Their continued success is justification for using an average of their combined results as a good target for other firms to aim for.</p><p>The rates of return derived from these combined accounts are very high indeed. Levels of inflation have a considerable impact on required rates of return, but allowing for the levels of inflation experienced in recent years, a return on equity of 27 percent (after corporation tax) is exceptional. It is likely that these returns will not be maintained over the coming years.<a id="iddle1706" class="indexterm"></a></p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lev2sec2"></a>Return on equity – geographic and sectoral analysis</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1409" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1771" class="indexterm"></a>We have described return on equity as being, probably, the single most important financial ratio we have.

In the former countries, we see returns in the high 20s; in the latter we see rates just above and below 10 percent.</p><p>Some of these variations can be explained by the differences in methods of accounting. For instance, in an environment that has experienced heavy takeover activity, followed by high goodwill write-offs, equity values in the balance sheet no longer give us a true value for shareholders’ investment, and ROE values would be overstated accordingly. It is the author’s opinion that an ROE of 15 percent is a very satisfactory return.</p><p>Across the industrial sectors there is no regular pattern between countries. The low overall return for Japan is consistent across all sectors. The food sector is the worst offender. It yields only 5 percent. It has shown a dramatic decline over the previous four years, indicating perhaps that the strong yen has caused the greatest damage here.</p><p>Outstanding at the other end of the scale are the very high returns being delivered by the US food sector. Included in this category are world-famous names such as Kellogg, Campbell’s Soup, Hershey Foods, etc. These companies with powerful brand identification deliver extraordinary levels of profit.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch06sb03"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/exclamation.jpg" width="37" alt=""/></div><p>It is interesting that this is the sector where companies have bought back a considerable amount of their own shares, a fact that suggests that they have difficulty in finding outlets for their enormous cash flow that will not dilute their very high returns.</p></div><p> </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lev2sec3"></a>Return on total assets – geographical and sectoral analysis</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch06sb04"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/exclamation.jpg" width="37" alt=""/></div><p><a id="iddle1486" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1716" class="indexterm"></a>We know that this is the second great performance measure and its importance cannot be over-stated.

It provides a benchmark against which all operations can be measured. However as a single figure it simply provides a target. To be useful in decision making it must first be broken down into its component parts. This will now be done in two stages. First the main ratio is divided into two subsidiary ratios (see <a class="link" href="ch06.html#ch06fig08" title="Figure 6.8. The return on total assets ratio and its two subsidiary ratios">figure 6.8</a>), then each of these is further divided into its detailed constituents.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch06fig08"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c06nf008.gif" width="500" alt="The return on total assets ratio and its two subsidiary ratios"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 6.8. The return on total assets ratio and its two subsidiary ratios</strong></p></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/hand.jpg" width="30" alt="The return on total assets ratio and its two subsidiary ratios"/></div><p>In Stage 1 the two prime subsidiary ratios are identified:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>margin on sales percentage</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>sales to total assets ratio (asset turn).</p></li></ul></div><p>ROTA is calculated by the fraction : EBIT/TA. We introduce the figure for ‘Sales’ and link it to each variable to give us two fractions instead of one. We get the ratios (a)EBIT/sales (profit margin) and (b)sales/TA (asset turn). It is simple mathematics to show that the product of these will always combine to the value of ROTA. This first split is so important that we will take the risk of over-emphasizing it here. The formula is:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="The return on total assets ratio and its two subsidiary ratios"/></div><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/072equ01.jpg" height="100" alt="The return on total assets ratio and its two subsidiary ratios"/></div></div><p>* Note that ‘Sales’ cancel out above and below the line.</p><div class="informalequation"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/072equ02.jpg" height="77" alt="The return on total assets ratio and its two subsidiary ratios"/></div></div><p>We have now derived two most important ratios, ‘profit margin’ and ‘asset turn’. The former identifies profit as a percentage of sales and is often described as the net profit margin. It is a well-known measure and almost universally used in the monitoring of a company’s profitability.</p><p>The latter ratio looks at the total sales achieved by the company in relation to its total assets, a measure that is less often emphasized in the assessment of company performance. However its contribution to ROTA is just as powerful and important as the profit margin.</p><p></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch06sb06"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/exclamation.jpg" width="37" alt=""/></div><p>The importance of this interrelationship of ratios is difficult to exaggerate. To repeat our logic so far:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>ROE is the most important driver of company value</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>ROTA is the most important driver of ROE.</p></li></ul></div><p>The ratios that drive ROTA are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>margin on sales percentage</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>sales to total assets ratio.</p></li></ul></div></div><p>We have seen that average return on total assets values for companies from many different industrial sectors tend to fall within a fairly narrow band, e.g. 12.5 percent, plus or minus 5 percent. However, the subsidiary ratios that deliver this standardized final result vary widely across different sectors.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html#ch06fig09" title="Figure 6.9. Indicative margin on sales and sales to total asset ratios for different types of business">Figure 6.9</a> shows some typical values for companies with vastly different profiles.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch06fig09"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c06nf009_1.gif" width="500" alt="Indicative margin on sales and sales to total asset ratios for different types of business"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 6.9. Indicative margin on sales and sales to total asset ratios for different types of business</strong></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lev3sec1"></a>Example A</h3></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="Example A"/></div><p>Here we see typical figures for a distribution-type company, where low margins, e.g. 5 percent to 7 percent combine with a high asset turn, e.g. 2 times.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lev3sec2"></a>Example B</h3></div></div></div><p>Here the opposite applies. Very high margins and low asset turns are typical of companies that require large quantities of fixed assets. The telecommunications sector generates sales margins in the region of 25 percent. However, their enormous investment in fixed assets with correspondingly low asset turns means that this margin is only just adequate to make a reasonable return on total assets.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lev3sec3"></a>Example C</h3></div></div></div><p>Here we see fairly average figures, with margins at 10 percent or more, and asset turn values somewhat greater than 1.

Companies in Japan operate on low margins but appear to have a somewhat better assets utilization. This latest finding runs contrary to popular belief. Much has been written about Japanese achievements in operating with very low inventory levels. While this may be true in specific industries it does not seem to hold across a wide range of companies.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch06sb07"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/exclamation.jpg" width="37" alt=""/></div><p>A rule of thumb would be that a margin of approximately 10 percent, combined with an asset turn of between 1.3 and 1.5 would be where many western companies would find a comfortable and profitable position.</p></div><p>It rests with the skill of each management team to discover for itself the unique combination of margin and asset turn that will give their company its own particular, and successful, market niche.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lev2sec6"></a>Sector parameters – return on total assets</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1772" class="indexterm"></a>In <a class="link" href="ch06.html#ch06fig12" title="Figure 6.12. Sector values for sales to total assets and margin on sales ratios for data from top UK companies in 1992">figure 6.12</a>, results of research into top UK companies in 1992 are still used here because they give a dramatic illustration of the interrelationship that exists between the two key variables that determine what a company will achieve in terms of return on total assets.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch06fig12"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c06nf012.gif" width="500" alt="Sector values for sales to total assets and margin on sales ratios for data from top UK companies in 1992"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 6.12. Sector values for sales to total assets and margin on sales ratios for data from top UK companies in 1992</strong></p></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="Sector values for sales to total assets and margin on sales ratios for data from top UK companies in 1992"/></div><p>Chart A shows values for ‘Sales to total assets’ and chart B ‘Margin’ values for six industrial sectors ranging from ‘food’ to ‘health care’. The two charts are almost minor images of one another. High sales to assets ratios are generally offset by low margins and vice versa. It is where the minor images do not exactly match where the high and low performers are located.</p><p>The values shown in Chart A of <a class="link" href="ch06.html#ch06fig12" title="Figure 6.12. Sector values for sales to total assets and margin on sales ratios for data from top UK companies in 1992">figure 6.12</a> point to a question concerning business performance that is absolutely critical. What level of investment is required to support any given level of sales? The results displayed here help us to understand why some sectors of industry seem to have a built-in advantage over others.</p><p>Chart A shows the high sales to total assets ratios inherent in the food industry. While this ratio is high in both retailing and manufacturing sectors, it is more pronounced in retailing.</p><p>Chemicals and stores both have ‘sales to total asset’ ratios that are approximately 20 percent above the average, but this advantage is mostly offset by their lower margins – particularly in the case of chemicals. The two sectors are still quite good overall.</p><p>When we look to the two final sectors, we see a dramatic contrast. The brewing value is very low, with a sales to total assets ratio of about 0.6 times. It may be more informative to turn this ratio upside down and say that it requires $1.60 of assets to carry $l.00 of sales. For any given level of sales, the investment in assets is enormous. In contrast, in the food retailing sector it takes only $0.45 to support $1.00 of sales. The brewing/distilling sector requires almost four times this investment to produce this result.</p><p>In the health sector, we note that the ‘sales to total assets’ ratio is also below average but this sector has a margin on sales that compensates by almost 200 percent for these somewhat high assets. The high margins in brewing are still not sufficient to pay for the very high investment in assets in this sector.<a id="iddle1055" class="indexterm"></a></p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div id="ftn.ch06fn01" class="footnote"><p><a href="#ch06fn01" class="para"><sup class="para">[*] </sup></a>These values are very high, but they have been derived from the results of the most successful US corporations (see <a class="link" href="apb.html" title="Appendix 2. Companies used in the sample">appendix 2</a>).
