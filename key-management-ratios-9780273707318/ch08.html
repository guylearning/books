A company that cannot do so has run out of liquidity and is in a very serious financial condition. Ironically, this is so even if it is currently generating good profits.</p></div><p>Cash in this case can be a bank account with a positive balance, or it can be a loan facility that the company has authority to draw down.</p><p>When cash runs out, the company’s management has lost the power to make independent decisions. An outside agency, such as an unpaid creditor or a bank whose loan is in default, will decide the fate of the company.</p><p>That fate could be bankruptcy, a forced reconstruction, an involuntary takeover, or the company could be allowed to continue in some altered form. The reality is that management has lost its authority. It is also likely that the owners have lost their entire investment.</p><p>One may well ask, ‘How can this happen if profits are good?’ The answer is that it does happen and for reasons that will become clearer later.</p><p>Loss of profits is often the immediate cause of the disaster, but as we have said, it can happen even when companies are making good profits. Indeed, profitable and rapidly growing small companies very often run out of cash. They then pass out of the hands of the original owner or entrepreneur who is left with nothing, while others reap the benefits of his enterprise.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/face.jpg" width="37" alt=""/></div><p><span class="italic">This chapter will examine corporate liquidity and the factors that drive it.

When we look at the cash flow diagram in <a class="link" href="ch08.html#ch08fig01" title="Figure 8.1. The operating cash cycle">figure 8.1</a>, the reason for this is obvious. Cash is in continuous circulation through the ‘arteries’ of the business carrying value to its various ‘organs’. If this flow is stopped, or even severely reduced for a time, then serious consequences result.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch08fig01"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c08nf001.gif" width="500" alt="The operating cash cycle"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 8.1. The operating cash cycle</strong></p></div></div><p>This diagram shows part of the total cash cycle, the part that we refer to as the working capital cash flow. Central to the system is a cash tank, or reservoir, through which cash flows constantly.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch08sb02"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/exclamation.jpg" width="37" alt=""/></div><p>It is crucial to the independent survival of the business that this tank does not run dry.</p></div><p>Supporting the cash tank is a supplementary supply, representing unused short-term loan facilities. These provide a first line of defense against a cash shortage. Day-to-day liquidity consists of these two separate cash reservoirs</p><p>The main flow of cash into the reservoir comes from ‘accounts receivable’. These are the customers who pay for the goods or services received from the company.</p><p>The main cash out-flows can be identified under two headings:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>payments to ‘accounts payable’, that is the suppliers of raw materials and services</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>payments of staff salaries/wages, and payments of all other operating expenses.</p></li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/hand.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>We can trace the steps in the cycle. ‘Accounts payable’ supply ‘raw materials’. In time these pass through ‘work in process’ into the ‘finished goods’ category. During this conversion, cash is absorbed in the form of labor and expenses and payments to suppliers.</p><p>In due course, these ‘finished goods’ are sold. Value passes down the artery into the ‘accounts receivable’ box, from which it flows back into the ‘cash’ reservoir to complete the cycle.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lev2sec1"></a>Cash flow – the role of profit and depreciation<a href="#ftn.ch08fn01" class="footnote" id="ch08fn01"><sup class="footnote">[*]</sup></a></h2></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt="Cash flow – the role of profit and depreciationcash flowsdepreciation andcash flowsprofits anddepreciationRefer to appendix 1 where the technical term EBITDA is explained and discussed."/></div><p>In <a class="link" href="ch08.html#ch08fig02" title="Figure 8.2. The operating cash cycle and the role of profit and depreciation">figure 8.2</a>, two further input values are shown that produce an increase in the cash in circulation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>profit</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>depreciation.</p></li></ul></div><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch08fig02"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c08nf002.gif" width="500" alt="The operating cash cycle and the role of profit and depreciation"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 8.2. The operating cash cycle and the role of profit and depreciation</strong></p></div></div><p>The input from profit is easy to understand. Normally goods are sold at a price that exceeds total cost. For instance if goods that cost $100 are sold at a price of $125, the $25 profit will quickly flow into the business in the form of cash.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch08sb03"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>It is a little more difficult to understand the input from ‘depreciation’. But depreciation is often quoted as a source of funds and we may have seen the definition:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>operating cash flow = operating profit + depreciation</strong></span></p></blockquote></div></div><p>It is not easy to see why this should be. What is so special about depreciation? The answer is that, for most companies, depreciation is the only cost item in the profit and loss account that does not have a cash out-flow attached to it. While referred to as a source of cash, it is really the avoidance of a cash out-flow. This point is more fully developed in the following section.</p><p>It must be emphasized that, even though depreciation does not have a related cash out-flow, it is a true cost nevertheless. The relevant cash out-flow has simply taken place at an earlier time. At the time the associated fixed assets were purchased, the cash cost was not charged against profits. It was, instead, charged to the balance sheet. As the asset is used up, an appropriate amount of cost is released into the profit and loss account. This is what depreciation is all about.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch08sb04"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/exclamation.jpg" width="37" alt=""/></div><p>What <a class="link" href="ch08.html#ch08fig02" title="Figure 8.2. The operating cash cycle and the role of profit and depreciation">figure 8.2</a> shows is that, with every full cycle, the amount of cash in circulation is increased by the profit earned plus the depreciation charged.</p></div><p> </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lev2sec2"></a>Depreciation and cash flow</h2></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="Depreciation and cash flow"/></div><p>The example in <a class="link" href="ch08.html#ch08fig03" title="Figure 8.3. The relationship between depreciation and cash flow">figure 8.3</a> illustrates the relationship between depreciation and cash flow. It is one that gives rise to much confusion.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch08fig03"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c08nf003.gif" width="500" alt="The relationship between depreciation and cash flow"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 8.3. The relationship between depreciation and cash flow</strong></p></div></div><p>The example uses the illustration of a very small haulage business. It has one single asset, namely a vehicle valued at $20,000 that the owner uses to transport goods on a jobbing basis. The business has no inventories or accounts receivable. It has no bank or other loans and all its transactions are carried out for cash.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The opening balance sheet</strong></span> is simple. It shows a single asset of $20,000 that is represented by capital of the same amount.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The profit and loss account</strong></span> highlights are:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border: none;"><colgroup><col width="150" style="text-align: left" class="c1"/><col width="150" style="text-align: left" class="c2"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>sales of</p></li></ul></div></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>$30,000</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>total costs of</p></li></ul></div></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>$27,000</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>profit of</p></li></ul></div></td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"><p>$3,000.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>The closing balance sheet</strong></span> shows a cash figure of $8,000. The company started with no cash and ended up with $8,000, but the profit was only $3,000. How can this be?</p><p>We run down through the items of cost and find that the depreciation charge is $5,000. No cash was paid out under this heading. The trading cash receipts were $30,000 and the trading cash costs were $22,000. Therefore the net cash from trading was $8,000. However from this net cash we must deduct depreciation to give the profit of $3,000.</p><p>Therefore it is simply a convenient shortcut to arrive at cash flow by adding back depreciation to profit.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/face.jpg" width="37" alt="The relationship between depreciation and cash flow"/></div><p><span class="italic">An interesting aspect of the depreciation effect is that certain types of companies can suffer serious trading losses without suffering from cash shortages. These are companies where depreciation is a big percentage of total cost, e.g., transportation or utility companies. So long as losses are less than the depreciation charged in the accounts, operations are cash positive.</span></p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lev2sec3"></a>Non-operating cash out-flows</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1098" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1121" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1122" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1126" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1127" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1129" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1133" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1146" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1297" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1298" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1306" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1447" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1512" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1580" class="indexterm"></a>In <a class="link" href="ch08.html#ch08fig01" title="Figure 8.1. The operating cash cycle">figures 8.1</a> and <a class="link" href="ch08.html#ch08fig02" title="Figure 8.2. The operating cash cycle and the role of profit and depreciation">8.2</a> we saw cash flowing round in a closed circuit.
