This approach gives us the same answer in our example but it emphasizes the importance of the asset values in determining shareholders’ funds. The authentic value for owners’ funds is derived simply by taking the total value of all assets in todays’ terms and deducting all third party liabilities.</p><p>Some adjustments to assets values (and, possibly, liabilities) will probably be necessary.</p><p>The more likely areas for adjustment are shown in <a class="link" href="ch12.html#ch12fig01" title="Figure 12.1. Company valuation applied to data from the Example Co. plc">figure 12.1</a>, i.e.:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>fixed assets</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>inventories</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>certain liabilities.</p></li></ul></div><p><a id="iddle1074" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1363" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1370" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1456" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1489" class="indexterm"></a></p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lev1sec2"></a>Share values</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1041" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1042" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1061" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1067" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1068" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1091" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1171" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1359" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1360" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1478" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1574" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1615" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1811" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1812" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1813" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1824" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1882" class="indexterm"></a>In <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Financial statements">chapter 2</a>, three types of share value were mentioned.

It serves to determine the value of ‘issued common stock’, i.e., in the Example Co. the number of issued shares is 32m. The par value is $2.5 to give a value of $80m. If new shares are issued, they will hold this same nominal value even though the issue price will be much above it, probably close to the current market price. Say new shares go out at a price of $17.50, there is a surplus of $15.00 over the nominal value. This surplus is called the ‘share premium’ and it forms part of the capital reserves. Many companies have shares of ‘no par value’. They simply put it in the books at the price they were sold at.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lev2sec2"></a>Book value (asset value, or asset backing) $11.25</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch12sb03"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>This value is arrived at by dividing the number of issued shares – 32m – into the owners’ funds of $360m. The book value of all the shares is $360m. Therefore each share has a book value of $11.25. You will recall that we discussed the need to validate that sum of $360m. For instance, if an examination of the inventories produced a more prudent valuation of $20m less than the balance sheet value ($108m), this write-down would reduce the common funds from 360m to 340m. The book value would fall from $11.25 to $10.62 per share.<a id="iddle1109" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1544" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1820" class="indexterm"></a></p><p> </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lev2sec3"></a>Market value $22.50</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch12sb04"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p><a id="iddle1312" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1321" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1333" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1552" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1817" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1823" class="indexterm"></a>This is the price quoted in the Stock Exchange for a public company or an estimated price for a non-quoted company.

Remember that the common shareholder comes last in the queue for participating in profit. The profit used in the calculation is the figure after all other claimants have been satisfied. The most common prior charges in the profit and loss account are interest and tax.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch12fig03"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c12nf003.gif" width="500" alt="Earnings per share for the Example Co. plc"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 12.3. Earnings per share for the Example Co. plc</strong></p></div></div><p>Therefore it is the earnings after tax (EAT) figure that is divided by the number of common shares to calculate the value of earnings per share. This figure tells us what profit has been earned by the common shareholder for every share held.</p><p>It serves no purpose to compare the earnings per share in one company with that in another because a company can elect to have a large number of shares of low denomination or a smaller number of a higher denomination. A company can also decide to increase or reduce the number of shares on issue. This decision will automatically alter the earnings per share. We cannot say, therefore, that a company with an earnings per share value of 50¢ is any better than one with a value of 40¢.</p><p>While the absolute amount of earnings per share tells nothing about a company’s performance, the growth in EPS over time is a very important statistic. Indeed, many chairpersons stress it as a prime target in annual reports. Furthermore, growth in earnings per share has a significant influence on the market price of the share.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/hand.jpg" width="30" alt="Earnings per share for the Example Co. plc"/></div><p><a id="iddle1301" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1424" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1428" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1432" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1665" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1808" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1816" class="indexterm"></a>Growth in EPS tells us more about a company’s progress than growth in absolute profits. Growth in profits can result from a great many things. For instance, a company could acquire another for shares and thereby increase its profit. However, if the percentage increase in profit is less than the percentage increase in the number of shares, earnings per share will fall even with higher profits.</p><p>Not only is growth in EPS most important, so also is its stability. Investors look closely at the quality of earnings. They dislike the erratic performance of companies with widely fluctuating profits. A high-quality rating is given to earnings that are showing steady, non-volatile growth.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lev2sec5"></a>Dividends per share (DPS)</h2></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="Dividends per share (DPS)"/></div><p><a class="link" href="ch12.html#ch12fig04" title="Figure 12.4. Dividends per share for the Example Co. plc">Figure 12.4</a> shows how to calculate this value. Only a fraction of the earnings accruing to the shareholders is paid out to them in cash. The remainder is retained to consolidate and expand the business.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch12fig04"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c12nf004.gif" width="500" alt="Dividends per share for the Example Co. plc"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 12.4. Dividends per share for the Example Co. plc</strong></p></div></div><p>It is a well-established rule that dividends are paid only out of profits, not from any other source. However, the earnings need not necessarily fall into the same year as the dividends. Therefore situations can arise when dividends exceed earnings. In such cases, dividends are being paid from earnings that have been retained in the business from previous years.</p><p>The total return to the shareholder over any given time consists of the dividend received plus the growth in the share price. While for some investors growth is most important, many shareholders and potential investors – both private individuals and institutions such as pension funds who need income for their day-to-day affairs – pay very close attention to dividends. They look at the absolute dividend per share and for a history of stable but growing payments.</p><p>Therefore companies dislike intensely to have to reduce the dividend because this will drive away investors with possibly serious effects on share price. A company in a difficult year will often decide that it must pay a dividend in excess of earnings rather than cut the pay-out. Of course, this policy can be followed only for a short time and when there is reason to believe that earnings will recover to a figure greater than the dividends.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lev2sec6"></a>Dividend cover and the pay-out ratio</h2></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="Dividend cover and the pay-out ratio"/></div><p><a id="iddle1299" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1618" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1815" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1825" class="indexterm"></a>These two ratios are mirror images of one another and give the same information. Both express the relationship between a company’s earnings and the cash paid out in dividends. <a class="link" href="ch12.html#ch12fig05" title="Figure 12.5. Dividend cover and pay-out ratio for the Example Co. plc">Figure 12.5</a> shows the calculations. For the first ratio divide EPS by DPS. For the second reverse the numbers.<a href="#ftn.ch12fn01" class="footnote" id="ch12fn01"><sup class="footnote">[*]</sup></a></p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch12fig05"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c12nf005.gif" width="500" alt="Dividend cover and pay-out ratio for the Example Co. plc"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 12.5. Dividend cover and pay-out ratio for the Example Co. plc</strong></p></div></div><p>Companies adopt dividend policies to suit their business needs. These will reflect the sectors in which they operate and the specific strategies they adopt. Fast-growing companies have a great need for cash and they pay out little. On the other hand stable low-growth companies pay out a high percentage of earnings.</p><p>We therefore see that public utility companies are noted for high stable pay-out policies. They are therefore, very popular with investors for whom income is the most important consideration. On the other hand, some computer companies have never paid a dividend, even though they have made large profits over many years. These companies attract investors who look for capital growth.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt="Dividend cover and pay-out ratio for the Example Co. plc"/></div><p>The importance of the dividend cover is the indication it gives of the future stability and growth of the dividend:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>a high cover (low pay-out ratio) suggests that the dividend is fairly safe, because it can be maintained in the face of any expected downturn in profit</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a high cover also indicates a high retention policy, which suggests that the company is aiming for high growth.</p></li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="Dividend cover and pay-out ratio for the Example Co. plc"/></div><p><a id="iddle1405" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1770" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1809" class="indexterm"></a><a class="link" href="ch12.html#ch12fig06" title="Figure 12.6. Dividend cover and pay-out ratio for the US Consolidated Company Inc.">Figures 12.6</a> and <a class="link" href="ch12.html#ch12fig07" title="Figure 12.7. Dividend cover by country and by sector">12.7</a> show what level of cover is normal.

It is not surprising, given their high historic growth rates.</p><p>It is worthwhile considering the implication of these numbers. Companies in the main retain more profits than they distribute. More than 50 percent of equity returns, therefore, should come from capital growth, not dividends. However, capital growth depends on the share price.</p><p>Most share prices show significant fluctuations around a central trend line. Therefore, the actual capital gain delivered to a particular investor is heavily dependent on the timing of the investment and its later conversion back into cash.</p><p>For instance, an investor in a high growth stock would suffer a capital loss if he bought at the high and sold at the low point in the cycle.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lev2sec7"></a>Earnings and dividend yield ratios</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch12sb05"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p><a id="iddle1304" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1323" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1404" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1467" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1814" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1818" class="indexterm"></a>The yield on a share expresses the return it provides in terms of earnings or dividends as a percentage of the current share price.

For instance, if the EPS is $1.50 and the share price is $10.00 the earnings yield is 15 percent. If the share price moved up to $15.00 the corresponding yield would be 10 percent. As the share price increases the yield falls. Paradoxically, a low yield indicates a share that is in much demand by investors. We will see in the next section its link to the price earnings ratio.</p><p>From the company point of view, the ratio indicates the return the company must provide to attract investors. If a company falls out of favor in the market-place the share price falls and the company is faced with a higher yield. It follows that a company with a poor image has to pay a high return to attract capital.</p><p>For the investor, yield calculations allow comparisons to be made between the return on shares and other types of investment, such as government stocks (gilts) or commercial property.</p><p>Managers of large investment funds constantly balance their portfolios between these different investment outlets. In doing so, they take account of the relative yields which change daily, together with the stability and capital growth expected in each area.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/hand.jpg" width="30" alt="Share yield ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country"/></div><p>Whereas the earnings yield specifies the total return, the dividend yield is more important for investors dependent on income from the shares. It allows them to compare the cash flow that they will receive from investing a fixed sum in different stocks or other investment outlets. As we have seen in the previous section, public utility companies with high pay-out ratios tend to produce high dividend yields and would be popular with pension fund managers.</p><p>The degree of variation in yield values is shown in the country variations illustrated in <a class="link" href="ch12.html#ch12fig08" title="Figure 12.8. Share yield ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country">figure 12.8</a>. The most striking result is the dividend yield for Japan at less than 1 percent. This is brought about by the low pay-out ratio already mentioned and high share prices.</p><p>These yield values are low in comparison to gilt yields. The expression ‘reverse yield gap’ is used to highlight the shortfall in dividend yields as opposed to those for gilts.<a id="iddle1308" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1408" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1423" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1619" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1639" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1726" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1826" class="indexterm"></a></p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lev2sec8"></a>Price to earnings ratio (P/E)</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch12sb06"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>The price to earnings ratio or ‘multiple’ is a widely quoted parameter of share value. <a class="link" href="ch12.html#ch12fig09" title="Figure 12.9. Price/earnings ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country">Figure 12.9</a> shows the method of calculation.

They are primarily interested in the prospects for <span class="strong"><strong>earnings growth</strong></span>. To estimate this they will look to the industrial sector, the company’s products, its management and its financial stability and growth history.</p><p>The company has no direct control over the PE ratio. It may influence it over the short-term by a good public relations exercise. In the long-term, however, it must deliver a good return to the equity shareholder to secure a continued high rating.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/hand.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>The advantages of a high price to earnings ratio value are considerable. The wealth of the company’s owners is increased in proportion. New funds can be raised at a favorable price. The possibility of a successful hostile takeover bid is much reduced. Most importantly, the company has the means to make acquisitions on favorable terms by using its ‘paper’ (shares), as opposed to cash.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>When we look at the P/E ratio across international boundaries (see <a class="link" href="ch12.html#ch12fig09" title="Figure 12.9. Price/earnings ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country">figure 12.9</a>), we see that the US and the UK show similiar values just short of 30 times. The returns for the EU are considerably lower, but we notice a considerable jump when we come to Japan. Here the current value is approximately 28, even though the market has fallen by 50 percent.</p><p>Japanese P/E values have puzzled western investors for years. A short while ago, many companies were in the 50 to 60 range. Attempts to explain this mentioned very low inflation rates, strong currency, low cost of capital etc. However stockmarket prices fell sharply and rates, while still high, are now more in line with western world norms.</p><p></p><div class="figure"><a id="ch12fig09"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c12nf009.gif" width="500" alt="Price/earnings ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 12.9. Price/earnings ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country</strong></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lev2sec9"></a>Market to book ratio</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch12sb07"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p><a id="iddle1546" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1821" class="indexterm"></a>The market to book ratio gives the final and, perhaps the most thorough assessment by the stockmarket of a company’s overall status. It summarizes the investors’ view of the company overall, its management, its profits, its liquidity, and future prospects.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p><a class="link" href="ch12.html#ch12fig10" title="Figure 12.10. Market to book ratio for the Example Co. plc and by country">Figure 12.10</a> shows the calculation. The ratio relates the total market capitalization of the company to the shareholders’ funds. To express it in another way, it compares the value in the stockmarket with the shareholders’ investment in the company.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch12fig10"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c12nf010_1.gif" width="500" alt="Market to book ratio for the Example Co. plc and by country"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 12.10. Market to book ratio for the Example Co. plc and by country</strong></p></div></div><p>The answer will be less than, greater than or equal to unity. It is the investors’ perception of the performance of the company in terms of profits, balance sheet strength or liquidity and growth that determines this ratio.</p><p>A value of less than unity means that the shareholders’ investment has diminished in value; it has wasted away. The investing community have given a ‘thumbs down’ signal to the company. They do not anticipate that future profits will be sufficient to justify the current owners’ investment in the company.</p><p>On the other hand, when this value is well in excess of unity, it means that the investment has been multiplied by the market/book factor. A high ratio does not simply mean that the worth of the company has increased over time by means of its retained earnings. The multiplier acts in addition to this. Each $1 of original investment, plus each $1 of retained earnings is multiplied by a factor equal to the market to book ratio.</p><p><a id="iddle1407" class="indexterm"></a></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt="Market to book ratio for the Example Co. plc and by country"/></div><p>Two important questions must be kept in mind when considering this ratio:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Do the shareholders’ funds reflect a realistic value for the assets?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Is the market rating going through an exceptionally high or low phase?</p></li></ul></div><p>Refer to <a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix 1. Special items">appendix 1</a> for various items that can affect this ratio.</p><p>The country analysis in <a class="link" href="ch12.html#ch12fig10" title="Figure 12.10. Market to book ratio for the Example Co. plc and by country">figure 12.10</a> shows widely differing values between the US and UK on the one hand and the rest of the EU and Japan on the other. In normal circumstances we would expect a value of between 2 and 3 times for this ratio, and these are the values we see for the EU and Japan. The extraordinary high values we encounter in the US and UK can only be accounted for by:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>the extraordinary exuberance in the market at the time;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the understatement of owners’ equity as a result of goodwill write-downs.</p></li></ul></div><p>The fall in the overall market will have reduced the numbers considerably.</p><p>The absolute minimum that management must achieve for this ratio is 1.0.
