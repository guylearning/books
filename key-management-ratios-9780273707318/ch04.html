It is a link or bridge between the opening and closing balance sheets of an accounting period. Its function is to identify the total revenue earned and the total costs incurred over that period. The difference between these two values is the operating profit. It is, therefore, a document that relates to a very precise time period. There are many accounting rules to do with the identification of revenue and costs.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch04fig01"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c04nf001.gif" width="500" alt="Place of the profit and loss account in company"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 4.1. Place of the profit and loss account in company</strong></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lev2sec1"></a>Total revenue earned</h2></div></div></div><p>Total revenue earned is generally the amount invoiced and, in most situations, there is no problem with its accurate identification. However, if we receive cash today for a contract to supply a service over the next three years, when should we take that into our accounts as revenue?</p><p>Also, there could be more than one view on the subject of what constitutes total revenue in the second year of, say, a large, three-year civil works project. Finally, if we are an engineering company and we sell a warehouse, is that part of revenue?</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lev2sec2"></a>Total costs incurred</h2></div></div></div><p>The figure for total costs can give rise to even more intractable problems.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch04sb01"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>Two rules will help to identify costs that must be included:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>those costs that relate directly to the revenue, for example the direct cost of the goods sold; and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>those costs that relate to the time period covered by the accounts, such as staff salaries for the period.</p></li></ul></div></div><p>Even with these rules, however, there are still many areas where the decision could go either way. Should research and development costs be charged in the year in which they were incurred? If we replace the factory roof in a period, is that correctly chargeable as a cost? We could question whether a particular depreciation charge is correct. The list can go on.</p><p>The statement of accounting policies attached to all published accounts will give some information regarding this aspect and it is wise to examine it before attempting an analysis of the financial statements.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lev2sec3"></a>Profit and loss – general observations</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1114" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1159" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1282" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1344" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1511" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1652" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1661" class="indexterm"></a>In a situation where accountants can sometimes differ, it is not surprising that non-accounting managers go astray. One or two basic signposts will eliminate many problems that arise for the non-specialist in understanding this account.</p><p>The distinction between profit and cash flow is a common cause of confusion. The profit and loss account as such is not concerned with cash flow. This is covered by a separate statement. For instance, employees’ pay incurred but not yet paid must be charged as cost even though there has been no cash flow. On the other hand, payments to suppliers for goods received are not costs, simply cash flow. Costs are incurred when goods are consumed, not when they are purchased or paid for.</p><p>Cash spent on the purchase of assets is not a cost, but the corresponding depreciation over the following years is.</p><p>A loan repayment is not a cost because an asset (cash) and a liability (loan) are both reduced by the same amount, so there is no loss in value by this transaction.</p><p>In recent years, the question of extraordinary items has been much discussed. The issue here is whether large, one-off gains or losses should be included with normal trading activities. We can readily accept for analysis purposes the argument that these should be set to one side and not allowed to distort the normal operating results. This was the approach used in producing accounts for many years. However, in some companies, the rule was used selectively. Items became extraordinary or otherwise in order to present the desired picture. The rule has now been changed to avoid the possibility of distortion.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch04sb02"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/exclamation.jpg" width="37" alt=""/></div><p>Finally the question of timing is vital. Having established what the true costs and revenue are, we must locate them in the correct time period. The issue mainly arises just before and just after the cut-off date between accounting periods. As shown in <a class="link" href="ch04.html#ch04fig02" title="Figure 4.2. The profit and loss account – timing adjustments">figure 4.2</a>, we may have to move revenue or costs forwards or backwards to get them into their correct time periods.<a id="iddle1230" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1723" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1852" class="indexterm"></a></p></div><p></p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch04fig02"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c04nf002.gif" width="500" alt="The profit and loss account – timing adjustments"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 4.2. The profit and loss account – timing adjustments</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lev2sec4"></a>Profit/loss – terms</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1038" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1296" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1310" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1313" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1319" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1328" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1602" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1655" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1660" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1663" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1664" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1667" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1668" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1701" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1867" class="indexterm"></a>Total revenue less total operating cost gives operating or trading profit. This is the first profit figure we encounter in the statements of account but there are many other definitions of profit.</p><p>We will identify four specific definitions and assign financial terms to them. These are related to the way profit is distributed.</p><p>All the assets used in the business have played a part in generating the operating profit to which we give the term ‘earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)’. Therefore this profit belongs to and must be distributed among those who have provided the assets. This is done according to well defined rules.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html#ch04fig03" title="Figure 4.3. The profit and loss account – distribution or appropriation of profits">Figure 4.3</a> illustrates the process of distribution or ‘appropriation’ as it is called in the textbooks. There is a fixed order in the queue for distribution as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>to the lenders (interest)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>to the taxation authorities (tax)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>to the shareholders (dividends/retentions).</p></li></ul></div><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch04fig03"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c04nf003_1.gif" width="500" alt="The profit and loss account – distribution or appropriation of profits"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 4.3. The profit and loss account – distribution or appropriation of profits</strong></p></div></div><p>At each of the stages of appropriation the profit remaining is given a precise identification tag. Stripped of non-essentials, the following is a layout of a standard profit and loss appropriation account. When looking at a set of accounts for the first time it may be difficult to see this structure because the form of layout is not as regular as we see in the balance sheet. However if one starts at the EBT figure, it is usually possible to work up and down to the other items shown:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt="The profit and loss account – distribution or appropriation of profits"/></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>EBIT – Earnings before interest and tax</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Deduct interest</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>EBT – Earnings before tax</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Deduct tax</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>EAT – Earnings after tax</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Deduct dividend</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>RE – Retained earnings</p></li></ul></div><p>(See <a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix 1. Special items">appendix 1</a> for further discussion of unusual items.)</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lev1sec2"></a>Working data</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1341" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1400" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1766" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1871" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1919" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1920" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1922" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1924" class="indexterm"></a>Throughout the various stages of the book we will work with three sets of data:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Example Co. plc</strong></span> has been devised with simple numbers to highlight various aspects of accounts and show the calculation of ratios (see <a class="link" href="ch04.html#ch04fig04" title="Figure 4.4. Working data – the Example Co. plc">figure 4.4</a>).</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch04fig04"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c04nf004.gif" width="491" alt="Working data – the Example Co. plc"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 4.4. Working data – the Example Co. plc</strong></p></div></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>US Consolidated Company Inc.</strong></span> (see <a class="link" href="ch04.html#ch04fig05" title="Figure 4.5. Working data – the US Consolidated Company Inc.">figure 4.5</a>).</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch04fig05"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c04nf005_1.gif" width="500" alt="Working data – the US Consolidated Company Inc."/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 4.5. Working data – the US Consolidated Company Inc.</strong></p></div></div></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Sectoral/geographical data</strong></span> (see <a class="link" href="apc.html" title="Appendix 3. Full set of ratio charts from sample companies">appendix 3</a>).</p></li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lev2sec5"></a>The Example Company plc</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html#ch04fig04" title="Figure 4.4. Working data – the Example Co. plc">Figure 4.4</a> shows for the Example Company plc:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>the balance sheet</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the profit/loss account</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>share data.</p></li></ul></div><p>It is worth while spending a moment looking over the now familiar five-box balance sheet and the structured profit/loss account to become familiar with the figures.
