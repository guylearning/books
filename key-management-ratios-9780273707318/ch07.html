However, these ratios cannot be operated on directly. Each is dependent on a whole series of detailed results from widely separated parts of the operation. These in turn can be expressed in ratio form and all that managers need is a system that will enable them to identify and quantify these subsidiary values so that they can:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>set the target value for each ratio that, if achieved, will deliver the required overall performance level</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>delegate the achievement of these targets to specific individuals.</p></li></ul></div><p>The system outlined in the following pages achieves this end. It will be seen that it incorporates all the main elements in both the profit and loss account and balance sheet. Each of the elements is a performance driver and must be managed accordingly.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lev2sec1"></a>Drivers of margin on sales</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch07sb01"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/exclamation.jpg" width="37" alt=""/></div><p>At its simplest, we can say that the margin is what is left when the total operating cost is deducted.</p></div><p>If the margin were 10 percent, the total cost would be 90 percent. The margin can be improved only if this 90 percent can be reduced. To reduce the figure, we must know its component parts. So, the next stage is identify the separate cost elements and see what percentage each of the main cost elements bears to sales (see <a class="link" href="ch07.html#ch07fig02" title="Figure 7.2. Drivers of margin on sales applied to data from the Example Co. plc">figure 7.2</a>).</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch07fig02"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c07nf002_1.gif" width="500" alt="Drivers of margin on sales applied to data from the Example Co. plc"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 7.2. Drivers of margin on sales applied to data from the Example Co. plc</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lev2sec2"></a>Drivers of the sales to total assets ratio</h2></div></div></div><p>This ratio is also broken down into its component parts.

The four main cost elements that accumulate to total operating costs are identified as materials, labor, factory overheads and admin/selling. These large cost groups are used for example purposes: in practice they would be broken down into much more detail.</p><p>In the lower part of the diagram, each cost element is shown expressed as a percentage of sales. For instance, the first box shows that materials is 38 percent (material cost of $426 over sales of $l,120 multiplied by 100). The sum total of all the costs is 90 percent, giving a margin of 10 percent.</p><p>If management wishes to improve this margin, then one or more of the cost percentages must fall. For instance, if the material cost percentage could be reduced by two points, from 38 to 36 percent, then, other things being equal, the margin percentage would improve by two points to 12 percent. This margin of 12 percent would then combine with the sales to total assets ratio of 1.4 times to give an improved return on total assets of 16.8 percent (that is, 12 percent multiplied by 1.4).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/hand.jpg" width="30" alt="Margin on sales – drivers"/></div><p>These cost ratios allow managers to plan, budget, delegate responsibility and monitor the performance of the various functional areas under their control. They can quantify targets for all areas, and calculate the effect of a variation in any one of the subsidiary ratios on the overall performance.</p><p>The results achieved by different managers, products and divisions can also be compared and the experiences of the best passed on to the others to help them improve. We must recognize, however, that there are operating factors that the model does not cope with. The variables of selling price, volume and product mix, which have such a powerful impact on profit, are not easily distinguished from other factors in the model. In later chapters these factors will be discussed further.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lev2sec4"></a>Sales/total assets – drivers</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1012" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1368" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1455" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1762" class="indexterm"></a>In <a class="link" href="ch07.html#ch07fig03" title="Figure 7.3. Drivers of sales to total assets ratio applied to data from the Example Co. plc">figure 7.3</a> it will be seen that just as the subsidiary values of the left-hand side were derived from the profit and loss account, so these right-hand elements are taken from the balance sheet. Each of the main asset categories is related to sales.</p><p>The three major asset blocks in most enterprises are:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt="Sales/total assets – drivers"/></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>fixed assets</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>inventories (stocks)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>accounts receivable (debtors).</p></li></ul></div><p>The value of each in relation to sales is shown in the subsidiary boxes. For instance, the ratio for fixed assets is 2.5 times (from sales of $1,120 divided by fixed assets of $440). Note that the sum of these separate values does not agree with the sales to total assets ratio as did the sales margin on the other side with the operating costs. This is because they are expressed differently. If the reciprocals of the values are taken, the link will become clear.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/hand.jpg" width="30" alt="Sales/total assets – drivers"/></div><p>To managers, this display shows the importance of managing the balance sheet as well as the profit and loss account. For instance, if the total assets could be reduced from $800 to $700, then the sales to total assets ratio would move up from 1.4 to 1.6 times. The effect on the return on total assets would be to increase it from 14 to 16 percent. If, in addition, the margin were increased by 1 percent to 11 percent, then the new return on total assets would be almost 18 percent (11 percent × 1.6 times). The original value of 14 percent for ROTA is an average value whereas a return on total assets of 18 percent represents an excellent performance.</p><p>In these areas, production managers can work with finance and marketing departments to quantify targets for stock holdings and accounts receivable. The impact of an increase in fixed assets caused by a major capital investment project can also be assessed in profitability terms.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lev1sec2"></a>Operating profit model</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1596" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1603" class="indexterm"></a>The complete model is shown in <a class="link" href="ch07.html#ch07fig04" title="Figure 7.4. Completed operating profit model applied to data from the Example Co. plc">figure 7.4</a>. It gives a very powerful insight into the drivers of good performance. It enables managers and functions to work better together as a team. It helps with the definition of responsibilities, delegation of authority and target setting. It provides a powerful framework for a management information system. However, there are a number of issues the model does not highlight.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch07fig04"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c07nf004_1.gif" width="500" alt="Completed operating profit model applied to data from the Example Co. plc"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 7.4. Completed operating profit model applied to data from the Example Co. plc</strong></p></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>First</strong></span>, a business normally deals not just in one product, but in a broad range. Cost percentages are averages of the cost elements of the individual products. For management control, it is not satisfactory to work with averages because favorable movements in one product will mask adverse movements in another (these issues are dealt with further in <a class="link" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Cost, volume and price relationships">chapter 15</a>).</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Second</strong></span>, a cost percentage, such as materials, can vary for two totally different reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>a change in the absolute material cost per unit</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a change in the unit selling price of the product.</p></li></ul></div><p>The model, however, cannot distinguish between these two causes, despite the fact that one of the most effective ways to reduce the cost percentages is a price increase.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Third</strong></span>, the model does not cope very well with changes in volume, which can be one of the most powerful ways open to a company to improve performance. A volume increase will certainly be picked up by the sales to total assets ratio – a 10 percent improvement in volume would move this ratio up from 1.4 to 1.54 times – but, because of fixed costs, the volume change is very likely to have an effect on the sales margin too (this subject is also dealt with in <a class="link" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Cost, volume and price relationships">chapter 15</a>).</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Fourth</strong></span>, the perceptive reader will have noted that this ratio is dependent on the valuation of the assets in the balance sheet. Difficulties can arise when we compare different businesses or divisions because of the age of plant, different depreciation policies and so on.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lev2sec5"></a>Model variations</h2></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/face.jpg" width="37" alt="Model variations"/></div><p><a id="iddle1014" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1054" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1168" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1274" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1430" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1461" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1736" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1737" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1753" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1767a" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1859" class="indexterm"></a><span class="italic">Many business ratios appear under different names, or are calculated differently, and this can cause some confusion. In the set of ratios we are looking at here, there are two that appear under a number of different guises.</span></p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lev3sec1"></a>Sales to accounts receivable</h3></div></div></div><p>This ratio is commonly expressed in terms of days’ sales and the method of calculation is shown in <a class="link" href="ch07.html#ch07fig05" title="Figure 7.5. Variations to operating model applied to data from the Example Co. plc">figure 7.5</a>. Instead of the formula we have been using here of sales over accounts receivable, the alternative is to show accounts receivable over sales and multiply the result by 365. The answer represents the average number of days’ credit customers take before paying off their accounts.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch07fig05"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c07nf005.gif" width="500" alt="Variations to operating model applied to data from the Example Co. plc"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 7.5. Variations to operating model applied to data from the Example Co. plc</strong></p></div></div><p>This ratio is often referred to as ‘debtor days’ or the ‘collection period’. The concept of the number of days outstanding is easy to understand. The number is very precise, which means that a slippage of even a few days is instantly identified. Also, figures can be compared with the company’s normal terms of trade and the effectiveness or otherwise of the credit control department can, therefore, be monitored.</p><p>Companies will vary their methods of calculation to reflect their own business circumstances and to provide answers that make sense to them in particular. For instance:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>VAT may be included in the debtors but not the sales figure and this distortion will have to be removed</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When there is a heavy seasonal variation, the monthly figures calculated in the normal way may not be very helpful and so the company may work, not on an annual sales basis, but on quarterly sales figures that are annualized.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lev3sec2"></a>Sales to inventories</h3></div></div></div><p>This calculation is similar to the one above and is also known as inventory days. The link of inventories with sales is not so close as that of sales with accounts receivable. It may, therefore, be linked to purchases or material usage, whichever gives the most useful guidance.<a id="iddle1375" class="indexterm"></a></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lev2sec6"></a>‘Sales to fixed assets’ ratio – international standards</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1462" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1748" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1776" class="indexterm"></a>This ratio, which is one of the strong determinants of company performance, is heavily influenced by the nature of the industry. It is, therefore, less amenable to management action than are many of the other performance drivers. For many years, it has been difficult for very capital-intensive sectors of industry to earn high returns except where there has been some element of monopoly.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="‘Sales to fixed assets’ ratio – international standards"/></div><p>The chart in <a class="link" href="ch07.html#ch07fig06" title="Figure 7.6. Sales to fixed assets ratio by country">figure 7.6</a> shows consistent rates around the world.
