To Richard Stagg of Financial Times Prentice Hall, who originated the concept and carried it through. To my friends and colleagues: the late John Oâ€™Sullivan, who was an unequaled source of reference on even the most esoteric subjects, and John Dinan, who restarted the motor after a blow-out.</p><p>I am grateful to the staff of the Irish Management Institute Library and Dublin Central Library for their unstinted provision of all the financial data that I sought, including data from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Financial Times</em></span> and Extel Financial Ltd, and to Geraldine McDonnell and Carol Fitzpatrick, who cheerfully coped with all the work of the section while the author was in seclusion.</p><p>Finally, I acknowledge the debt I owe to my fellow travellers: Tom Cullen; the late Des Hally; Diarmuid Moore; Martin Rafferty. They ploughed the first furrows and sowed the seed.</p></div></div>
