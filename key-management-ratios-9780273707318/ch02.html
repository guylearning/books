This job is not as formidable as it appears at first sight, because:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>much of the subject is already known to managers, who will have come in contact with many aspects of it in their work;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>while there are, in all, hundreds of components, there are a relatively small number of vital ones;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>even though the subject is complicated, it is based on common sense and can, therefore, be reasoned out once the ground rules have been established.</p></li></ul></div><p>This last factor is often obscured by the language used. A lot of jargon is spoken and, while jargon has the advantage of providing a useful shorthand way of expressing ideas, it also has the effect of building an almost impenetrable wall around the subject that excludes or puts off the nonspecialist. I will leave it to the reader to decide for which purpose financial jargon is usually used, but one of the main aims here will be to show the common sense and logic that underlies all the apparent complexity.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt="Introduction"/></div><p>Fundamental to this level of understanding is the recognition that, in finance, there are three – and only three – documents from which we obtain the raw data for our analysis. These are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>the balance sheet</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the profit and loss account</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the cash flow statement.</p></li></ul></div><p>A description of each of these, together with their underlying logic, follows.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lev2sec1"></a>The balance sheet (B/S)</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1069" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1136" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1650" class="indexterm"></a>The balance sheet can be looked on as an engine with a certain mass/weight that generates power output in the form of profit. You will probably remember from school the power/weight concept. It is a useful analogy here that demonstrates how a balance sheet of a given mass of assets must produce a minimum level of profit to be efficient.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch02sb01"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>But what is a balance sheet? It is simply an instant ‘snapshot’ of the assets used by the company and of the funds that are related to those assets. It is a static document relating to one point in time. We therefore take repeated ‘snapshots’ at fixed intervals – months, quarters, years – to see how the assets and funds change with the passage of time.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lev2sec2"></a>The profit and loss (P/L) account</h2></div></div></div><p>The profit and loss account measures the gains or losses from both normal and abnormal operations over a period of time. It measures total income and deducts total cost. Both income and cost are calculated according to strict accounting rules. The majority of these rules are obvious and indisputable, but a small number are less so. Even though founded on solid theory, they can sometimes, in practice, produce results that appear ridiculous. While these accounting rules have always been subject to review, recent events have precipitated a much closer examination of them. Major changes are under way in the definition of such items as cash flow, subsidiary companies and so on.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lev2sec3"></a>The cash flow (C/F) statement</h2></div></div></div><p>The statement of cash flow is a very powerful document. Cash flows into the company when cheques are received and it flows out when cheques are issued, but an understanding of the factors that cause these flows is fundamental.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lev2sec4"></a>Summary</h2></div></div></div><p>These three statements are not independent of each other, but are linked in the system, as shown in <a class="link" href="ch02.html#ch02fig01" title="Figure 2.1. Three basic financial statements">figure 2.1</a>. Together they give a full picture of the financial affairs of a business. We will look at each of these in greater detail.<a id="iddle1070" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1137" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1651" class="indexterm"></a></p><p></p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch02fig01"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c02nf001.gif" width="500" alt="Three basic financial statements"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.1. Three basic financial statements</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lev1sec2"></a>The balance sheet</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1043" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1490" class="indexterm"></a>The balance sheet is the basic document of account. Traditionally it was always laid out as shown in <a class="link" href="ch02.html#ch02fig02" title="Figure 2.2. The balance sheet – traditional layout">figure 2.2</a>, i.e., it consisted of two columns that were headed, respectively, ‘Liabilities’ and ‘Assets’. (Note that the word ‘Funds’ was often used together with or in place of ‘Liabilities’.)</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch02fig02"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c02nf002.gif" height="210" alt="The balance sheet – traditional layout"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.2. The balance sheet – traditional layout</strong></p></div></div><p>The style now used is a single-column layout (see <a class="link" href="ch05.html#ch05fig03" title="Figure 5.3. Vertical sheet version 1 using data from the Example Co. plc">figure 5.3</a>). This new layout has some advantages, but it does not help the newcomer to understand the logic or structure of the document. For this reason, the two-column layout is mainly used in this publication.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lev2sec5"></a>Assets and liabilities</h2></div></div></div><p>The ‘Assets’ column contains, simply, a list of items of value owned by the business.</p><p>The ‘Liabilities’ column lists amounts due to parties external to the company, including the owners.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch02sb02"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>(The company is a legal entity separate from its owners, therefore, the term ‘liability’ can be used in respect of amounts due from the company to its owners.)</p></div><p>Assets are mainly shown in the accounts at their cost (or unexpired cost). Therefore the ‘Assets’ column is a list of items of value at their present cost to the company. It can be looked on as a list of items of continuing value on which money has been used or spent.</p><p>The ‘Liabilities’ column simply lists the various sources of this same sum of money.</p><p>The amounts in these columns of course add up to the same total, because the company must identify exactly where funds were obtained from to acquire the assets.</p><p>All cash brought into the business is a source of funds, while all cash paid out is a use of funds. A balance sheet can, therefore, be looked on from this angle – as a statement of sources and uses of funds (see <a class="link" href="ch02.html#ch02fig03" title="Figure 2.3. The balance sheet – sources and uses of funds approach">figure 2.3</a>). You will find it very helpful to bear this view of the balance sheet in mind as the theme is further developed (see <a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Cash flow">chapter 11</a> for hidden items that qualify this statement to some extent).<a id="iddle1392" class="indexterm"></a></p><p></p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch02fig03"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c02nf003.gif" height="191" alt="The balance sheet – sources and uses of funds approach"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.3. The balance sheet – sources and uses of funds approach</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lev2sec6"></a>Balance sheet structure</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1011" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1044" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1045" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1078" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1112" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1241" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1276" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1454" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1839" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1866" class="indexterm"></a><a class="link" href="ch02.html#ch02fig04" title="Figure 2.4. The balance sheet – basic five-box layout">Figure 2.4</a> shows the balance sheet divided into five major blocks or boxes. These five subsections can accommodate practically all the items that make up the total document. Two of these blocks are on the assets side and three go to make up the liabilities side. We will continually come back to this five-box structure, so it is worthwhile becoming comfortable with it, as we go through each box in turn.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch02fig04"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c02nf004.gif" height="249" alt="The balance sheet – basic five-box layout"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.4. The balance sheet – basic five-box layout</strong></p></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt="The balance sheet – basic five-box layout"/></div><p>Let us look first at the two asset blocks. These are respectively called:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>fixed assets (FA)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>current assets (CA).</p></li></ul></div><p>These can also be considered as ‘long’ and ‘short’ types of assets. We will see that while this distinction is important in the case of assets, it is even more significant in the case of funds.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lev2sec7"></a>Current assets (CA)</h2></div></div></div><p>This box in the south-west corner contains all the short-term assets in the company. By short-term we mean that they will normally convert back into cash quickly, i.e. in a period of less than 12 months.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt="Current assets (CA)"/></div><p>The various items that find their home in this box can be gathered together under four headings:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>inventories (stocks)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>accounts receivable (trade debtors)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>cash</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>miscellaneous current assets.</p></li></ul></div><p>These items (see <a class="link" href="ch02.html#ch02fig05" title="Figure 2.5. The balance sheet – current assets box">figure 2.5</a>) are in constant movement. Inventories of raw materials are converted into finished goods. These when sold are transformed into accounts receivable which in due course are paid in cash to the company.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch02fig05"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c02nf005.gif" width="500" alt="The balance sheet – current assets box"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.5. The balance sheet – current assets box</strong></p></div></div><p>The ‘miscellaneous’ heading covers any short-term assets not included elsewhere and is usually not significant. The amount of cash held is often small also, because it is not the function of a company to hold cash. Indeed, where there are large cash balances, there is usually a very specific reason for this, such as a planned acquisition.</p><p>The two significant items in current assets therefore are the inventories and accounts receivable. They are very important assets that often amount to 50 percent of the total balance sheet of the company.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lev1sec3"></a>Balance sheet structure – fixed assets</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1046" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1047" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1367" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1440" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1468" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1563" class="indexterm"></a>Fixed assets comprise the second major block of assets. They, occupy the north-west corner of the balance sheet (see <a class="link" href="ch02.html#ch02fig06" title="Figure 2.6. The balance sheet – the fixed assets box">figure 2.6</a>).</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch02fig06"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/02fig06.jpg" width="500" alt="The balance sheet – the fixed assets box"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.6. The balance sheet – the fixed assets box</strong></p></div></div><p>We use the term ‘fixed assets’ even though the block contains items that do not strictly fall under this heading. A more accurate description would be ‘long investment’, but the term ‘fixed assets’ is more commonly used.</p><p>The items that fall into this block are grouped under three headings:</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lev2sec8"></a>Intangibles</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch02sb03"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>Included under the heading intangibles are all assets that do not have a physical presence. The main item is goodwill. This is a component that gives rise to some controversy and is dealt with in <a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix 1. Special items">appendix 1</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lev2sec9"></a>Net fixed assets</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch02sb04"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>Large, expensive, long-lasting, physical items required for in the operations of the business are included here. Land, buildings, machinery, and office and transport equipment are the common entries. The standard method of valuation is to take original cost and deduct accumulated depreciation. In the case of property, adjustments may be made to reflect current values (see overleaf).</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lev2sec10"></a>Investments</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch02sb05"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>‘Investments/other assets’ include long-term holdings of shares in other companies for trading purposes. Not all such investments are shown in this way. Where the holding company has dominant influence – either by virtue of a majority shareholding or other means – then the accounts of the subsidiary company are totally consolidated. This means that the separate assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are aggregated with corresponding items in the parent company’s balance sheet. It is only investments in non-consolidated companies that are shown here.</p></div><p> </p><p><a id="iddle1248" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1491" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1492" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1493" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1509" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1510" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1523" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1697" class="indexterm"></a>The question as to whether the balance sheet values should be adjusted to reflect current market values has, for years, been a contentious question. In times of high inflation, property values get out of line – often considerably so – and it is recommended that they be revalued. However, it is important to note that the balance sheet does not attempt to reflect the market value of either the separate assets or the total company. Prospective buyers or sellers of course examine these matters closely.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lev1sec4"></a>Balance sheet structure – liabilities</h1></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt="Balance sheet structure – liabilities"/></div><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html#ch02fig07" title="Figure 2.7. The balance sheet – the three subdivisions of the liabilities column">Figure 2.7</a> shows three subdivisions of the liabilities column:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>owners’ funds (OF)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>long-term loans (LTL)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>current liabilities (CL).</p></li></ul></div><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch02fig07"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c02nf007_1.gif" width="500" alt="The balance sheet – the three subdivisions of the liabilities column"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.7. The balance sheet – the three subdivisions of the liabilities column</strong></p></div></div><p>(There are certain types of funds that do not fit comfortably into any one of the above listed classes.

Unfortunately, it is also the area where most confusing entries appear in the balance sheet.</p><p>For the newcomer to the subject the most important thing to remember is that the total in the box is the figure that matters, not the breakdown between many different entries.
