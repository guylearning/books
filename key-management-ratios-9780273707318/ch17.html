These have been in use for many years, they are still widely used and they have served the business community well. However many practitioners have now come to the conclusion that something more is needed.</p><p>Global competition, worldwide recession, and complex financial instruments have shown up weaknesses in these traditional approaches. This has given rise to a search for more precise instruments of assessment. The search has not been in vain, and there are now exciting new developments in this area.</p><p>The most robust of these new techniques is that most commonly known as ‘shareholder value added’ (SVA)<a href="#ftn.ch17fn01" class="footnote" id="ch17fn01"><sup class="footnote">[*]</sup></a>, but the terms ‘economic value added’ (EVA), and ‘market value added’ (MVA) are also used.</p><p>These systems all have the same underlying approach. They adopt an economic rather than an accounting stance, and they look to the future rather than the past.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/face.jpg" width="37" alt="Introduction"/></div><p><span class="italic">One of the problems with the purely accounting approach is that it relies largely on values that are historic. Furthermore these values are derived from accounting statements that are produced according to various accounting conventions. Often these conventions are more useful for auditing purposes rather than for performance assessment or valuation.</span></p><p>There are other issues that traditional approaches do not address explicitly such as risk measurement and future capital investment. There is no doubt that SVA methods provide a more comprehensive and philosophically sound basis for managerial decisions than those used in the past.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lev1sec2"></a>Description</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1152" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1470" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1669" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1783" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1887" class="indexterm"></a>The economic viewpoint is that value is determined by future cash flows rather than historic profit or balance sheet calculations. Cash is invested today in order to get a surplus back in the future. This future cash flow must fully repay the initial investment and also cover the cost of the funds over the period of investment. This cash flow technique has been used for many years in the assessment of capital projects (see <a class="link" href="ch16.html" title="Chapter 16. Investment ratios">chapter 16</a>).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="Description"/></div><p>Let us say that we are faced with a capital project decision on whether we should spend $1m on a particular piece of equipment. We estimate future revenues and costs over the life of the equipment. We convert these into the extra cash in-flow that the equipment will produce. We combine that in-flow with other cash movements arising from working capital etc. Then we discount the total cash flow back to a net present value (NPV). We use that figure to assess the financial value of the investment.</p><p>The shareholder value approach is to use the same technique to assess the value of a company’s operations either in whole or in part.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/tickmark.jpg" width="30" alt="Description"/></div><p>However in regard to a company special considerations apply:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The returns from a company cannot be so neatly packaged as those from a single piece of equipment. In a company there will be many different operations each giving rise to a separate cash flow.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>With a single piece of equipment there is usually a very definite and limited life span, but not so with a company.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In straightforward project appraisal, a very pragmatic approach to the selection of a discount factor is common. But what discount factor should be applied to the cash flows of a company overall? This is a very important consideration because the factor chosen will have a major bearing on the assessment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Companies can be funded in many different ways.

Where there is zero growth, earnings are constant and each year they can be paid out in full. So the return is similiar to that of a high-yielding fixed interest bond. The price of such a bond is determined by its return relative to its required yield. There is a premium of 20 percent in this situation.</p><p>However where some of the earnings are not paid out but in order to achieve growth are re-invested at the premium rate the effect on value is compounded. The funds that are re-invested earn a higher rate of return than they would if they had been paid out. The higher the rate of retention and re-investment the greater will be the effect on value.</p><p>But all this assumes that the company can re-invest at the premium ROIC.

There are not many companies that persist with overall high growth and with low profitability, but within individual companies there are nearly always divisions, business units or single products that have these characteristics. They reduce the value of the total company. Very often this factor is not easily seen from the figures presented to management. The real worth of shareholder value analysis lies in the light that it throws on these situations.</p><p>In <span class="strong"><strong>section C</strong></span> we have a situation where ROIC is exactly equal to WACC. Here growth has no effect on value. Intuitively it can be difficult to accept this concept.</p><p>The reason for this phenomenon is that growth almost always requires extra investment. The funds for this extra investment will have to be paid for at the WACC rate. Extra profits will be earned at the ROIC rate. Where these are exactly equal, they cancel one another out. Therefore no extra benefit accrues to the existing shareholders. Growth has not added value.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/face.jpg" width="37" alt="Alternative scenarios: creating and destroying value"/></div><p><span class="italic">In economics we are taught that extra increments of investment will continue to be made so long as the extra returns exceed the extra costs, but the return will be less with each increment. Equilibrium is reached only when the extra returns and costs are equal. We will use this concept to put a value on a company at a specific future time.</span></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lev1sec7"></a>Terminal (continuing) value</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1794" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1849" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1899" class="indexterm"></a>The second important issue we did not fully deal with is the question of terminal value.

We will use the ROIC – WACC relationship to direct us towards a logical solution.</p><p>Management’s objective is to implement strategies that will give their company a competitive advantage that will allow it to earn a return greater than WACC. Where they achieve this premium return they add value for the shareholders.</p><p>However this premium return will inevitably attract competition that will whittle away its advantage over time. Without some competitive advantage a company will not continue to earn premium profits, so its ROIC will fall back to the level of WACC. Of course, good management will continuously seek to put in place new strategies that will restore the advantage.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch17sb07"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/exclamation.jpg" width="37" alt=""/></div><p>The valuation approach we use here is one that measures the value of the company as it now stands with its existing strategies.</p></div><p>In shareholder value analysis we assess the number of years forward for which current strategies will continue to add value. At the end of that ‘horizon period’ there will be equality between ROIC and WACC. Further growth beyond that date will not add value. We make this the point where we assess the continuing or terminal value of the company.</p><p>To calculate the terminal value we simply take the cash flow in that final year and assess it as we would value an annuity. That is we divide the cash flow by the cost of capital. When we use this more logically sound approach in our example we produce a value somewhat in excess of the earlier shortcut approach.
