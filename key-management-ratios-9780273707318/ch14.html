There is a need for balance between profits, assets and growth (see <a class="link" href="ch14.html#ch14fig01" title="Figure 14.1. Growth and the need for balance">figure 14.1</a>). Any imbalance between these factors will impact strongly on cash flow. Given the opportunities and corresponding dangers of growth, particularly in times of high inflation, it is wise to consider whether there is some way in which we can specify for a company what level of growth it can safely absorb. This chapter illustrates one particular method that many companies have found useful.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>To assist in our analysis, we will take the case of the CABCO Construction company shown in <a class="link" href="ch14.html#ch14fig02" title="Figure 14.2. CABCO Construction Ltd – summary accounts for years 1997, 1999, 2001">figure 14.2</a>.

However, it has a rapidly deteriorating financial position. The current ratio has dropped from 2.3 to 1.4 times over the four years and the debt to total assets ratio has risen from 37 percent to 61 percent over the same period. The liquidity ratios were very strong in 1997 but have sunk to their lowest acceptable level by 2001. The most worrying aspect of the case is the speed at which the liquidity position has deteriorated.</p><p>Performance, as measured by return on equity, was low but improved significantly in 2001. It made a passable return of almost 20 percent before tax to its shareholders, but it is now close to a liquidity crisis. Accordingly, management must take urgent action to stop the downward trend and change the direction in which the company is going.</p><p>This chapter is concerned with the problem of identifying and quantifying the options open to management, but, more importantly, it will extract general rules relating to company growth and how it can be handled.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="CABCO Construction Ltd – summary accounts for years 1997, 1999, 2001"/></div><p><a id="iddle1155" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1245" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1254" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1527" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1560" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1829" class="indexterm"></a>In <a class="link" href="ch14.html#ch14fig03" title="Figure 14.3. CABCO Construction Ltd – balance sheet movements over four years">figure 14.3</a> the CABCO balance sheets for 1997 and 2001 are shown roughly to scale. The total assets of the 2001 balance sheet are 70 percent greater than that for 1997. From the size of the individual balance sheet boxes we see that the major expansion is in both current assets and current liabilities. An explosion in the value of current assets has been financed almost entirely by an increase in current liabilities. Because of this the company has drifted from a strong liquidity base into an unstable, high-risk financial position. If the drift continues, bankruptcy is the likely result – or at least a change of ownership and control.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch14fig03"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c14nf003_1.gif" width="500" alt="CABCO Construction Ltd – balance sheet movements over four years"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 14.3. CABCO Construction Ltd – balance sheet movements over four years</strong></p></div></div><p>The immediate problem is an excess of short-term borrowings. They cannot be increased and, if possible, they should be reduced. Possible courses of action to which management has already given consideration are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>reducing investment in current assets in absolute terms or at least as a proportion of sales</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>introducing long-term funds in the form of loans or equity.</p></li></ul></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="ch14sb02"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong></strong></p></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/questionmark.jpg" width="30" alt=""/></div><p>Because of industry custom and the situation of the business, management were of the opinion that current assets could not be reduced relative to sales, so attention was, therefore, concentrated on the possibility of finding additional long-term funds. The questions they had to answer were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>‘<span class="emphasis"><em>How much?</em></span>’</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>‘<span class="emphasis"><em>What form – equity or loan?</em></span>’</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>‘<span class="emphasis"><em>If loan, what term of years?</em></span>’</p></li></ul></div></div><p>When cash flow forecasts were produced, it quickly became evident that a long-term loan would not solve the problem as such borrowed money could not be repaid. Instead, more and more borrowings would be required because of the negative cash flow that this company generated each year. By negative cash flow is meant that sufficient funds are not being generated internally to fund the assets required by the operations.</p><p>Companies in such a heavily negative cash flow position have a form of financial diabetes. They have a perpetual cash haemorrhage because the values of certain operating parameters are out of balance. It is necessary to identify and quantify the factors behind this condition.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch14lev1sec2"></a>Analysis</h1></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/percentage.jpg" width="30" alt="Analysis"/></div><p><a id="iddle1247" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1309" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1422" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1429" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1702" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1746" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1759" class="indexterm"></a><a class="link" href="ch14.html#ch14fig04" title="Figure 14.4. CABCO Construction Ltd – critical asset, profit and growth relationships">Figure 14.4</a> extracts some of the basic figures for 1995.

These three values, with a growth rate of 15 percent collectively, give rise to a strong negative cash flow.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>The relationship of current assets to sales is 0.67</strong></span> ($1,521/$2,280): each $1 of sales requires 67¢ to carry it.

This rate of 3 percent is the rate of growth in current assets the company can fund from its retained earnings. The company has been growing at 15 percent over the last 4 years. The excess growth of 12 percent has been funded by borrowing. In this company, all the borrowing has been short term, hence the financing problem.</p><p>Current sales are $2,280. If 12 percent of this has to be funded externally next year at the rate of 67¢ for each $1 sale, the company will have to borrow an extra $180. The following year it will need to borrow $180 plus 15 percent and so on, indefinitely.</p><p>There is a fundamental problem here that arises from the fact that the relationships identified above are out of balance.

This is the fraction of the growth that is self-funded. It tells us that 80 percent is funded from outside sources.

As sales expand rapidly these do likewise, thereby creating a great demand for cash. Retained profits are not adequate to meet this need.</p><p>The model enables management to focus on the fundamental issues facing this company. These relate to profit, current assets and growth. Management must take steps to balance the relationship between these three so that the equilibrium value (‘E’) is increased from .02 up to 1.0.</p><p>Some scenarios are illustrated in <a class="link" href="ch14.html#ch14fig06" title="Figure 14.6. CABCO Construction Ltd – growth equilibrium calculation">figure 14.6</a>.</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a id="ch14fig06"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/c14nf006.gif" width="500" alt="CABCO Construction Ltd – growth equilibrium calculation"/></div></div><p class="title"><strong>Figure 14.6. CABCO Construction Ltd – growth equilibrium calculation</strong></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch14lev2sec1"></a>Growth equilibrium – scenarios</h2></div></div></div><p>As stated above, management can focus on the essential elements of the problem. The three variables must be brought into balance so that the resulting equilibrium value ‘E’ is increased to at least 1.0.

It is not likely that any one of these in isolation would be the most practical solution. A strategy involving elements of all three would be more likely to bring results. The final combination strategy is shown as an illustration.</p><p>This version of the growth model is built up from the relationships that exist between between current assets, retained earnings and growth in a particular company.</p><p>It gives valid results for a company in the situation of CABCO Construction Ltd. This company is heavily current-assets-based and very heavily borrowed. The version is also useful, with slight amendments, for trading companies and rapidly growing small businesses.</p><p>However for companies with a more regular asset structure and with normal debt potential, a model with a more general application is needed.
