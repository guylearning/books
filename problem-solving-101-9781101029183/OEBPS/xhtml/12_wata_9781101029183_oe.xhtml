			<b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b>
		</div>
		<div class="bmtx1">I would like to thank my family, friends, mentors, classmates, teachers, colleagues at McKinsey from all over the globe, the publishing staff of the original Japanese book and of the English edition in the U.S., the illustrators, my agent, and the Delta Studio staff for all the support you have provided, for everything you have taught me, and for making this journey so precious and exciting. I would like to visit each one of you to thank you personally in the upcoming months.</div>
		<div class="bmtx">I would like to also send my special thanks to the former office manager at McKinsey, Tokyo, Masao Hirano, my editor Courtney Young, the illustrator Allan Sanders, and the Delta Studio staff, Seita Yui and Takashi Yamashita. Masao was very supportive of my educational initiatives and provided me with the opportunity to write this book. Courtney has put so much time and effort to edit this book—this book could have not been published without your generous and warm support. Allan, thank you for the wonderful drawings you have drawn—they have really brought charm to the book. Seita and Takashi, thank you for the great support for Delta Studio; you have made this journey so fun, heart-warming and exciting.</div>
