		</div>
		<div>
			<a id="h1"/>
		</div>
		<h1 class="h1"><b>YOU’RE NEVER TOO OLD TO BECOME A PROBLEM-SOLVING KID</b></h1>
		<div class="tx1">This is a book about kids solving problems. They face some pretty tricky challenges—the kinds of problems that might cause most people to throw up their hands and give up. But problem-solving kids aren’t like most people—even though most people should be more like them.</div>
		<div class="tx">As you’ll see, problem-solving kids come in all ages, shapes, and sizes. They may seem to have special talents, or at least more than their fair share of luck. But the truth is, they’re people just like you, who have learned how to think, make decisions and act on their own, and to live proactive lives. They’ve also picked up some helpful problem-solving tools along the way.</div>
		<div class="tx">If you follow the simple lessons in these pages, you too can become a problem-solving kid (even if you consider yourself a grown-up). Rather than feeling as though your life is out of your control, you can take charge and shape the world around you. Instead of being overwhelmed by the challenges you face every day, you can learn to enjoy them and overcome them.</div>
		<div class="tx">In fact, you may even feel like a better person at the end of this  course. Your dreams and goals will seem less out of reach. And you’ll be better able to accomplish whatever you’re passionate enough and imaginative enough to conceive and pursue.</div>
		<div class="tx">It could be something as simple as becoming a better dancer or learning how to cook French cuisine. Or maybe it’s a bigger goal, like running for president or solving the global warming crisis. Whatever it is, you’ll learn how to tackle it.</div>
		<div class="tx">Problem solving isn’t a talent limited to the lucky few. It’s actually a skill and a habit that you can learn. This book will introduce you to a basic problem-solving approach through three case studies:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• The Mushroom Lovers, a new band trying to improve their concert attendance numbers</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• John Octopus, a bright young man with aspirations of becoming a computer graphics animator who needs to buy his first computer</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Kiwi, an aspiring soccer player looking for the best training school in Brazil</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">It will also give you a full toolbox of proven problem-solving techniques, the same techniques used by successful problem-solving people and companies all over the world. But before we start learning the problem-solving approach, let me introduce you to the problem-solving kids and their friends.</div>
		<div>
			<a id="h2"/>
		</div>
		<h1 class="h1"><b>PROBLEM-SOLVING KIDS AND COMPANY</b></h1>
		<div class="tx1">So by now you’re probably wondering what is it exactly that makes someone a problem-solving kid. First, let’s talk about what they’re not. There are several common attitudes that can get in the way of effective problem solving. While the following characters may sound like caricatures of real people, I bet these non-problem-solving kids also sound pretty familiar. Chances are you know people  just like them at school or at work. Maybe they’re your friends or members of your family. Some of them may even remind you of yourself!</div>
		<div class="tx">For instance, take Miss Sigh.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="003" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_003_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">
			Miss Sigh is the kind of person who gives up immediately whenever she faces even the smallest challenge. She just sighs and says, “I’ll never be able to do that.” Which isn’t to say she <i>couldn’t</i> achieve things if she tried. Sometimes she has a great idea or notices a problem that can be fixed. But she’s terrified of failing and having people laugh at her. Instead of speaking up or taking action, she sits around feeling sorry for herself.
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Miss Sigh can’t take control of her own life. She feels as though no one understands her, and she blames anything bad that happens on everybody else. Over and over, she says the same kinds of things:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• “I’ll never be able to do that. I’m just not that talented.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “I’m not going to try. What if I fail? Everyone will make fun of me!”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “I blame my parents. I blame society. I blame you!”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “Nobody understands me. Nobody cares about me. Everybody is out to get me.”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Mr. Critic, on the other hand, is never afraid to speak up. He is a professional criticizer. Whatever the plan, he is ready to point out the shortcomings and shoot down everyone else’s ideas. If someone tries something and fails, he’ll be the first to say, “I told you so.” He’s always eager to blame someone else whenever things go wrong.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="004" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_004_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">He may have a lot to say about other people’s mistakes, but he never does much of anything himself. As you probably know, being a critic is easy; getting stuff done is the real challenge. Even if you know how things should be done, it’s useless if you aren’t willing to roll up your sleeves and get to work. It’s possible that Mr. Critic may not realize how little his criticisms are appreciated by people who are actually trying to get things accomplished. Or maybe he’s too afraid to take responsibility and face the fact that he himself makes mistakes.</div>
		<div class="tx">You may hear Mr. Critic saying things like:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• “Well, that definitely won’t work. What a stupid idea!”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “I told you that would get screwed up. It’s all your fault.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “Come on, I told you what you needed to do. Why can’t you get it done?”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Mr. Critic may be a big downer, but Miss Dreamer has her head stuck in the clouds. She loves coming up with new ideas. But it rarely goes beyond that. She never bothers to figure out how to turn her ideas into real plans, and she definitely doesn’t try to get anything done. She is satisfied just thinking about her great dreams. They’re always better in her head than they would be in reality, anyway.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="005" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_005_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Miss Dreamer has many audacious dreams—dreams that never seem to become realities:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• “I want to write a novel!”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “Wouldn’t it be great if I started my own business?”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “I want to be a doctor when I grow up.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “I’m an idea person. Don’t bother me with the nitty gritty details!”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Mr. Go-Getter may not seem like a non-problem solver when you first meet him. He’s definitely not one to worry about problems or entertain negative thoughts. And when something goes wrong, he quickly jumps into action. His attitude is “I can’t change the past. But I can do something now.” Mr. Go-Getter’s tenacity and proactiveness are definitely positive traits.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="006" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_006_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">However, if he knew how to pause and think for a minute before rushing to execute, he would be able to achieve so much more. He also tends to blame every failure on a simple lack of effort—he thinks any problem can be solved by trying harder. When he makes up his mind about how to solve a problem, he refuses to change course. He’s not interested in seeking out the root cause of his problems or in considering alternative solutions. He just doesn’t realize that stopping to think can be just as important as taking action.</div>
		<div class="tx">Mr. Go-Getter can often be heard saying things like:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• “I’ll never give up. I’ve got to overcome this challenge!”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “I’ve got to try harder! I can’t stop now!”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “I know this will work if I just put in a little more effort.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “Why stop to think? That’s just a waste of time. Everything is about execution!”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Are you one of these types? Do you ever find yourself sighing and giving up? Do you think it’s easier to criticize other people rather than trying to do anything on your own? Do you love to dream but hate to plan? Do you attack problems head on but fail to turn on the brakes when you aren’t getting anything done? Or are you more like a problem-solving kid?</div>
		<div class="tx">Problem-solving kids have a real flair for setting goals and getting things accomplished. They take overcoming challenges in stride. Like Mr. Go-Getter, they don’t agonize over problems. However, unlike Mr. Go-Getter, they think about the root causes of their problems and map out an effective plan before and while taking action, and they are willing to rework their plan as new challenges pop up. By striking a balance between thinking and acting, they can accomplish amazing things. Problem-solving kids enjoy learning from their successes as well as from their failures.</div>
		<div class="tx">The tool kit of a problem-solving kid includes identifying the root cause of a problem and setting specific goals. They have positive attitudes and stay focused on what can be changed rather than what already happened. They come up with specific action plans to fix their problems and then execute right away. Once they take action, they constantly monitor their own progress.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="007" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_007_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Here’s what you may hear from a problem-solving kid:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• “Okay! I’m going to accomplish this within three months.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “This is a problem, but rather than worrying about it, I’m going to figure out what I can do about it.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “So what really caused this?”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “To fix this, we’re going to need to do X, Y, and Z. Let’s try them out.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “So how did this work out? What went wrong? Is there a way we could do this better next time?”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Take a look at the following chart. It compares the five characters we’ve just met and highlights their differences.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="008" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_008_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">In the chart, all five characters have a problem they need to solve.</div>
		<div class="tx">Miss Sigh circles around the starting point, sighing away. Of course, she gets nowhere.</div>
		<div class="tx">Mr. Critic is certain he knows how the problem should be solved, and he quickly points out to others what they are doing wrong. But  he doesn’t do anything, and his criticisms don’t help anyone else get the problem solved, either. The dotted lines from his starting point are all the other people’s plans that he shot down.</div>
		<div class="tx">Miss Dreamer does not get to the goal, either. She just stares at the goal like it’s a bright, beautiful star. Sitting at the starting point, she dreams of grand and wonderful solutions to the problem, but never tries to make them happen.</div>
		<div class="tx">Unlike the first three, Mr. Go-Getter at least tries to reach the goal. He never gives up and just keeps on running as fast and as hard as he can. However, he is not necessarily running in the right direction. When he figures out that he’s going the wrong way, he turns and starts running in another wrong direction as fast as he can. He never stops to identify the root cause of his problem or figure out an effective plan. It’s a shame, because he certainly has more than enough motivation to reach his goal.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="009" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_009_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">The problem-solving kids achieve their goal more quickly and directly than the others. While they have plenty of Mr. Go-Getter’s guts and speedy execution, they also figure out the actual root cause of the problem they need to solve before coming up with an actionable plan and going to work. As they travel toward their goal, they never stop monitoring their own progress to make sure they’re headed in the right direction. While others get nowhere or head in  the wrong direction, the problem-solving kids have already reached that first goal and are heading for the next one.</div>
		<div class="tx">Problem solving isn’t a talent that some people have and others don’t. It’s a habit. By developing the right skills and adopting the right attitude, anyone can become a problem-solving kid.</div>
		<h2 class="h2"><b>Problem-Solving Kids Evolve at an Amazing Rate</b></h2>
		<div class="tx1">Problem-solving kids don’t just reach their goals faster; they evolve faster, too. They check out the impact of their actions and try to learn from their successes as well as their failures.</div>
		<div class="tx">If you never take action, you’ll never get any feedback on your attempts, and without feedback, you’ll never grow as a problem-solving kid. That great idea in your head will remain just that—only an idea. When you do take action, every result is an opportunity to reflect and learn valuable lessons. Even if what you take away from your assessment seems to be of small consequence, all of these small improvements taken together make a huge difference in the long term.</div>
		<div class="tx">Let’s look at an example: Alex, Bianca, and Cliff all own fruit stands that each sells 100 watermelons per month. Alex’s business increases at a rate of 1 percent each month, while Bianca’s increases by 5 percent, and Cliff’s increases by 10 percent. How different would their watermelon sales be in three years?</div>
		<div class="tx">After three years, Alex will be selling 143 watermelons a month. However, Bianca will be selling 579 watermelons, while Cliff will be selling a whopping 3,091 watermelons every month. While Bianca is selling more than five times as many watermelons as Alex, Cliff is selling twenty-two times more than Alex. He is going to need a bigger fruit stand for all those watermelons. Imagine what the difference would be over a longer time period, like ten years, or thirty!</div>
		<div class="tx">In the following chart, Cliff’s business growth soars above his more slowly improving competitors. That seemingly small 10 percent rate of improvement means a lot in the long run.</div>

		</div>
		<div class="tx">Through both your successful and unsuccessful experiences, your problem-solving skills can develop beyond solving your own problems to actually shaping your environment. You may start by leading your sports team or school or community to do greater things. Maybe you’ll even create a great business or solve some of the world’s most challenging problems.</div>
		<div>
			<a id="h3"/>
		</div>
		<h1 class="h1"><b>WHAT IS PROBLEM SOLVING?</b></h1>
		<div class="tx1">Problem solving is a process that can be broken down into four steps: (1) understand the current situation; (2) identify the root cause of the problem; (3) develop an effective action plan; and (4) execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary.</div>
		<div class="tx">These steps come as a package. Before you can solve anything, you first need to realize that there’s a problem. Once you do, identifying the root cause of the problem isn’t enough. You have to think through how you could fix the problem, and then actually  take the actions required to fix it. Problem solving is a combination of thinking and acting. Just doing one or the other won’t get you anywhere.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="011" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_011_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">You might think this sounds really simple. The catch is that we often don’t do what seems simple and obvious. For example, consider a student whose math grades are going down. Like many people, he might just say, “I have to raise my grades,” and hope for the best without actually doing anything to improve them. Chances are that his math grades are going to stay right where they are, because he never bothers to figure out the root cause of his problem and what he can do about it.</div>
		<div class="tx">Or maybe the student decides, “I have to quit the soccer team so I have more time to study.” Even with this drastic action, his grades may not improve if it turns out the real problem was not how long he studies, but how effectively he studies. Why give up the chance to play soccer with your friends for nothing?</div>
		<div class="tx">So what would a problem-solving kid do in this situation? Let’s look at an example:</div>
		<div class="tx">A problem-solving kid may start by asking himself, “What types of questions am I getting wrong?” Then he could break the questions into categories, like algebra, fractions, and geometry. By comparing his scores by category, he may find that his algebra score is actually going up, while his score in fractions is flat, and really only his geometry scores are going down. Just looking at the average trend of the math grades as a whole doesn’t help him see what is really happening.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="012" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_012_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">So if geometry seems to be the only area causing the grade to drop, the next step would be to further break down the geometry scores into additional subtopics, including area, angles, and volume, to better identify what types of problems are causing him trouble.</div>
		<div class="tx">When his understanding of the situation goes from the level of “My math grades are going down” to the much more nuanced “My math grades are going down because I am not doing well in three topics: trapezoid area, cylinder volume, and Pythagorean theorem application,” the effectiveness of his plan and the end result will be significantly different.</div>
		<div class="tx">Once the problem-solving kid has identified what types of problems he is getting wrong, his next step is to figure out exactly what he should do to perform better. Should he increase the time he spends studying math, improve his productivity when he does study, or both? To increase his math study time, he could decide to  wake up thirty minutes earlier or take thirty minutes before going to sleep to practice solving these types of problems. Improving his productivity means changing his approach to studying. He could switch to a better textbook, ask his teacher or friends to help him go over his most challenging problems after school, or ask his parents to hire a tutor.</div>
		<div class="tx">The reason math grades go down are different for everybody. So, naturally, the most effective way to solve a math-skills problem would also be different for everybody. This is why you have to keep asking the “why” and the “how” to develop a custom-made action plan.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="013" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_013_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">As you can see, problem solving is not complicated. All you have to do is understand the situation, identify the root cause, develop an effective plan, and execute. Even if the problem you face is big and complicated, if you learn how to break it down into smaller, manageable problems, you will be able to solve it.</div>
		<div class="tx">Once you learn the basic problem-solving approach, you can stop panicking and gain the confidence to solve any problems that you face in life, whether they are about grades, work, or your personal life.</div>

			<div class="ctBT-T">
				<b>PROBLEM-SOLVING TOOL BOX: LOGIC TREE</b>
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">A logic tree is a great tool to use when you problem solve. It’s a visual tool that helps when you are trying to identify all the potential root causes of a problem and generate a wide variety of solutions.</div>
			<div class="tx">The key to making a useful logic tree is to break down a problem into categories without leaving anything out, and to group similar items under the same branch.</div>
			<div class="tx">This will make more sense if we start with an easy example. How would you break down a class of third-graders? One way is to break it down by gender: boys and girls. Another way is to break it down by height: taller than four feet, four feet or shorter. You could also break it down by the dominant hand: right-handed, left-handed, or both.</div>
			<div class="tx">The logic trees for these breakdowns would look like this:</div>
			<div class="centerAligned">
				<img alt="015" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_015_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="tx">Pretty simple, right? Did you notice that that when you create the branches, no one gets left out and none of the branches overlap one another?</div>
			<div class="tx">Now, how would you break down a class according to the clubs students belong to?</div>
			<div class="tx">Were you able to create a logic tree that is not missing anything and that does not overlap?</div>
			<div class="tx">When you create the logic tree, you don’t necessarily have to build it from left to right. Simply start by listing whatever comes to mind on a piece of paper. To build the tree, group major topics (e.g., “Belongs to a school club”) on the left, moving to more minor or limited topics (e.g., “Sports,” “Art,” etc.) to the right. Group similar topics together (“Team sports,” “Mainly individual sports”). The next step is to create more branches.  Starting at the right, for each group of topics, ask yourself, “What can I call this group to sum it up?” Draw a branch to the left and write the name of that group. From the left side of the tree, for each bigger topic ask, “Specifically what or how?” to add sub-branches out to the right. Just like the logic tree above, the finished tree grows bigger from left to right.</div>
			<div class="centerAligned">
				<img alt="016" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_016_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="tx">Let’s try one more example:</div>
			<div class="tx">How do you increase the amount of pepper that comes out of a pepper shaker without changing the strength or speed you use to shake the bottle? Use a logic tree to come up with as many ideas as possible. (And let’s assume humidity is not an issue.)</div>
			<div class="tx">How did it go? Here is one potential solution:</div>
			<div class="centerAligned">
				<img alt="018" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_018_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="tx">To build this tree, you start with the problem on the left: “How can I increase the amount of pepper that comes out of the bottle in one shake?” You can then begin building branches by coming up with possible solutions. Two possible solutions are (1) to increase the area of the top surface, or (2) to increase the amount of pepper that comes out of the surface area. To branch out from the second option, two possible ways to increase the amount of pepper from the surface area are (1) to increase the number of holes in a given area, or (2) to increase the amount of pepper that comes out of each hole. Finally, you can increase the amount of pepper that comes out of each hole by increasing the size of each hole or by reducing the size of the pepper grains. In fact, increasing the size of the holes is how one major spice company increased its sales!</div>
			<div class="tx">Sometimes when you’re developing a logic tree it helps to draw a picture. It will help you identify the parameters that can be changed.</div>
			<div class="centerAligned">
				<img alt="019" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_019_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">It may take you a while to get the knack for making logic trees, but once you master it, it will help you to think beyond the initial spark of an idea and lead you to come up with new and effective solutions to your problems.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">In the following classes, we’ll see how the problem-solving approach and tools are used by various problem-solving kids: a rock band called the Mushroom Lovers, who want to increase their concert attendance; John Octopus, who wants to buy a computer as a first step toward achieving his dream of becoming an animator and a Hollywood movie director working with computer-generated imagery (CGI); and Kiwi, an aspiring soccer player trying to find the best school in Brazil to hone her skills.</div>
