			<b>SOCCER SCHOOL PROS AND CONS</b>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">Problem-solving kids are great decision makers. They rarely regret their choices, because they take the time beforehand to consider all their options and figure out the best decision for them personally.</div>
		<div class="tx">In this class, we’ll see how Kiwi, a young soccer star, goes about choosing a new school. Kiwi is a smart kid, and she always makes sure she knows what she’s getting into.</div>
		<div>
			<a id="h1"/>
		</div>
		<h1 class="h1"><b>KIWI, THE SOCCER GIRL</b></h1>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="066" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_066_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">Meet Kiwi. Kiwi has loved soccer her whole life. She’s been playing ever since she learned how to walk. Every day on the way to school, she dribbles and juggles her soccer ball, rain or shine. She even practices in the snow.</div>
		<div class="tx">She is short and tiny, even for a soccer player, but due to her lightning speed, great agility, and amazing skills, she grew up to be a great player—in fact, she is now the starting striker for the under-seventeen national team, even though she’s still a freshman in high school! Pretty impressive, huh?</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi just got back from a world tour with her team a few days ago, and since then all she can think about is moving to Brazil to train. Her team played an exhibition match against the Brazilian U-17 team—and lost 0-10. There was absolutely nothing she could do about it. The Brazilians were simply better at every aspect of the game. Kiwi started thinking she will need to train and play in a much more competitive environment if she ever wants to be a world-class player.</div>
		<div class="tx">As her team traveled around the world, playing games in Asia, South America, Europe, and the Middle East, Kiwi also realized that she has a lot to learn about the world. This was her first time away from home, and it turns out her worldview was pretty narrow. Now she wants to live in a different country and become bicultural and bilingual.</div>
		<div>
			<a id="h2"/>
		</div>
		<h1 class="h1"><b>KIWI’S SEARCH BEGINS</b></h1>
		<div class="tx1">Kiwi is an adventurous girl. Once she makes up her mind about something, she quickly jumps into action. First she asks her parents if she can transfer to a school in Brazil to play soccer. Touched by Kiwi’s commitment and passion, they say okay. However, they make her promise to balance soccer with school work, and tell her she must pick a school where the tuition is less than $3,000 per year.</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi is overjoyed. She runs to her computer and begins researching Brazilian soccer schools on the Internet. She finds the two most famous schools and writes down the pros and cons of each one in the back of her notebook. It turns out that all the starting members of the Brazilian soccer team came from one of these two schools. Kiwi knows she must be on the right track.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="067" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_067_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">She starts with Rio High School, the winner of last year’s Brazilian high school soccer championship. Kiwi is impressed with Rio High School’s homepage; it’s accessible not only in Portuguese, but also in English, Spanish, Italian, French, and Japanese for foreign applicants.</div>
		<div class="tx">When she opens the homepage, dramatic music plays as a welcome message scrolls across her computer screen:</div>
		<div class="atx1g">
			<div class="ctBT-T">
				<b>Rio High School</b>
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">
				We have not only the <b>best</b> high school <b>soccer</b> team in the world, but also the <b>best</b> environment for <b>foreign students</b> to learn. We have a program specially designed for their needs. That is why we have <b>30+ U.S. students</b> and <b>many others</b> from all over the world.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi is very impressed with Rio’s website. She decides RHS is the school she should be going to. She also learns that the school is in Rio de Janeiro, the big city she has always wanted to visit. “Wow, it’s in Rio de Janeiro!” she exclaims. “I can finally try out surfing at the beaches there!” She also looks at the tuition online and discovers that it is just within her budget, $3,000 per year. How could it get better than this!?</div>
		<div class="tx">Next she looks up Amazon High School, the runner-up in last year’s championship. She tries various searches, like “Amazon High School” and “Brazilian soccer, runner-up, high school,” but none of them bring her to the school’s homepage. Luckily, Kiwi has been studying Portuguese in school. She tries another search, typing in “Amazonas Escola.” Near the bottom of the search results, she finds a website for Amazon High School. However, unlike Rio High School, they have a Portuguese-only site.</div>
		<div class="tx">Using her English-Portuguese dictionary, she scours the Amazon High School website and finally digs out the following information:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• Amazon’s soccer team was, in fact, the Brazilian runner-up last year.</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• No foreign students currently attend the school, so, of course, no tailored programs exist for foreigners.</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• The school is located in the mountains far from Rio-more than two hours away.</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• The tuition is $5,000 per year, which is $2,000 over her budget.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi uses a pros-and-cons grid to compare the two schools. By lining up the benefits and drawbacks of both schools next to each other, she is quickly able to determine which school is a better option.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="068" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_068_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Looking at her grid, Kiwi quickly makes her decision: “Amazon High School is not only less attractive, but it is also over my budget. I guess Rio High School is the place for me!” She stays up until 4 a.m. filling out the online application for Rio High School and then goes to bed. Even though it’s very late, her eyes remain wide open. She can’t stop thinking about the exciting new journey ahead of her.</div>

			<div class="ctBT-T">
				<b>PROBLEM-SOLVING TOOL BOX: PROS AND CONS; CRITERIA AND EVALUATION</b>
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">There are two tools that are very helpful when you need to evaluate multiple options and select the best one.</div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div class="tx1">
				<b>Tool 1: Pros and Cons</b>
			</div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div class="tx1">The first tool is called pros and cons. This tool helps you broaden your options and ensures that you consider both the good aspects (pros) and bad aspects (cons) before making a final decision. Pretend that, like Kiwi, you are trying to pick a new high school to attend. The pros-and-cons tool can help you sort out the differences between your choices.</div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div class="tx1">Step 1: List All the Options</div>
			<div class="tx1">First list all your options; for example, you could have three schools to choose from: Armadillo High School, Beaver High School, and Cougar High School.</div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div class="tx1">Step 2: List the Pros and Cons of Each of the Options</div>
			<div class="tx1">Next list all the pros and cons of each of the options. Even if you think a certain option is the most attractive, get into the habit of asking yourself, “Aren’t there negative aspects? Are there other positive aspects?” We tend to be swayed by our first impressions. If we first think something is attractive, we tend to try to collect evidence that supports that idea. On the other hand, if we think something is unattractive, we tend to highlight only its negative points. It is critical to avoid this tendency in order to make a sound decision. Your list of pros and cons for the three high schools might look something like this:</div>
			<div class="centerAligned">
				<img alt="070" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_070_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">Step3: Weight Each of the Positive and Negative Points You Listed</div>
			<div class="tx1">Not all the arguments for or against each choice have the same importance. The next step is to assign a weight to each of the items.</div>
			<div class="tx">Let’s use the following weighting for this example:</div>
			<div class="atx1">
				<div class="tx1">
					+ + +/- - -Very attractive/unattractive <br/>+ +/- -Moderately attractive/unattractive <br/>+/- Marginally attractive/unattractive
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="tx">Say you think quality of education and cost are very important (so their weight is +/- 3) while the age of the school building is not that important (meaning its weight is +/- 1).</div>
			<div class="centerAligned">
				<img alt="071" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_071_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">Step 4: Select the Most Attractive Option</div>
			<div class="tx1">The final step is to select the best option considering the weighted pros and cons you have listed. In this case, you should probably choose Beaver High School, which has the most plusses and least minuses.</div>
			<div class="tx1">
				<b>Tool 2: Criteria and Evaluation</b>
			</div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div class="tx1">The next tool is criteria and evaluation. You can use this tool to clarify which criteria, or qualifications, you should use to evaluate your options, decide the importance of each set of criteria, and effectively evaluate your options.</div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div class="tx1">Step 1: List All the Options</div>
			<div class="tx1">As you did with the pros-and-cons tool, first list all your options. Again, we’ll be choosing between Armadillo High School, Beaver High School, and Cougar High School.</div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div class="tx1">Step 2: List the Evaluation Criteria</div>
			<div class="tx1">When you say a school is good or bad, what are your specific criteria? We’ve been using the following qualifications:</div>
			<div class="liste">
				<div class="lsl1">• Quality of education</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Availability of a study abroad program</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Strength of the baseball team</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Estimated number of friends going to the school</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Distance to school</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Newness of the school building</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Cost of tuition</div>
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">Step 3: Decide the Degree of Importance of Each Criteria</div>
			<div class="tx1">The next step is to decide the degree of importance for each of the criteria you listed in the last step. You can use three levels, like high, medium, and low, or you can use a 10-point scale. We’ve assigned the following weightings to the criteria:</div>
			<div class="liste">
				<div class="lsl1">• Quality of education: High</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Availability of a study abroad program: High</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Strength of the baseball team: Medium</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Estimated number of friends going to the school: Medium</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Distance to school: Low</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Newness of the school building: Low</div>
				<div class="lsl1">• Cost of tuition: High</div>
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">Step 4: Evaluate Each Option Based on the Weighted Criteria</div>
			<div class="tx1">Next you evaluate each option based on the criteria you’ve set. You can evaluate them with as many levels as you want. For this example, let’s use a three-level evaluation method ranging from “+++” for very attractive to “+” for not attractive.</div>
			<div class="centerAligned">
				<img alt="072" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_072_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="tx">As you can see in the “Distance to school” row, you can add specific numbers (e.g., 25 minutes). If you have specific data, include it to be as clear as possible. If something can be evaluated with either a yes or a no (such as the availability of a study abroad program), indicate that as well.</div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div>
				 <br/></div>
			<div class="tx1">Step 5: Select the Most Attractive Option</div>
			<div class="tx1">Finally, select the most attractive option. Make sure you consider the weight of the evaluation criteria when you make your final judgment. Again, in this example you’d probably choose Beaver High School because Beaver High has high scores on important criteria such as the quality of the education and the availability of a study abroad program, despite low scores on less important criteria, like the distance to the school and the newness of the building.</div>
			<div class="tx">Both the pros-and-cons tool and the criteria-and-evaluation tool will lead you to the same result and help you to select the best option out of many. But these are more than just tools for organizing your thoughts. They help point out information you might be missing and bring up questions you may need to ask yourself along the way about what you really think is important. Furthermore, you may be able to come up with ways to reduce some of the shortcomings of your options.</div>

		<h1 class="h1"><b>THE COMMENTATOR’S GRIPPING ANALYSIS</b></h1>
		<div class="tx1">The next day, Kiwi watched the evening sports news on ESPN, which is a daily ritual for her. There was a special on titled “Why the Yankees Can’t Win,” and something one of the commentators said grabbed Kiwi’s attention:</div>
		<div class="atx1">
			<div class="tx1">“Why can’t the Yankees win despite all their superstar players? Put yourself in the shoes of a player who never becomes a starter because the owner (who by the way knows nothing about baseball) decides to hire ready-made superstars from other teams. The rookies have it the worst. Think about it: These guys almost never have a chance at becoming starters. How can they develop their talent if they don’t get to play? A strong team doesn’t always equal a great growth environment. It’s no wonder the team’s morale is so low.”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="073" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_073_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Staring at the TV screen, Kiwi muttered to herself, “A strong team doesn’t always equal a great growth environment. . . .” The commentator had a point. Kiwi suddenly found herself wondering whether she had been using the right criteria to evaluate her school options.</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi reconsidered her original goals: “My main goal is not to play for the best soccer team. I want to become the best player I can by putting myself in the best soccer environment. My second goal is to become bilingual and bicultural.”</div>
		<div class="tx">She jotted down the list of her criteria for picking a school and the importance of each on a piece of paper. As she went through this process, numerous questions started to pop into her head. She started to challenge the thinking process that led her to conclude that Rio High School was not only better but also the only financially feasible option. She started to question herself and challenge her own assumptions.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="074" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_074_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• Great environment to improve at soccer: “What specifically are the key factors of a ‘great soccer environment’ for me?”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Great environment to become bicultural and bilingual: “Rio’s tailored program for foreigners sounds nice, but how good is it really? Is it really a benefit to have more than thirty U.S. students in the school when I am going all the way over to Brazil to experience a different culture and to learn a new language?</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Cost: “I can’t change the two schools’ tuitions, but is there a scholarship I could get?”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Close to Rio: “This is not an important criterion considering my main goals. I may have overrated this factor.”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi made a very common mistake. We often make important decisions without taking enough time to think through the options and to track down accurate information.</div>
		<div class="tx">As Kiwi started to do here, it is valuable to challenge your own thinking. For the second night in a row, Kiwi lay awake until dawn. But she felt as though she wasn’t getting anywhere. Her mind just kept looping back around over the same questions.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="075" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_075_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">“Just worrying and thinking about these questions won’t get me anywhere,” Kiwi told herself. “I need to figure out what actions I can take to make a better decision.” As she jotted down the following to-do list, she finally felt relieved and promptly fell asleep. She dreamed that she was leaving for Brazil, boarding her plane at the airport and feeling full of hope. The dream was amazingly real. She could clearly hear her family and friends as they wished her good luck and felt their arms when they hugged her good-bye.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="076" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_076_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<h2 class="h2"><b>Finding a Great Soccer Environment</b></h2>
		<div class="tx1">The next morning, Kiwi called Coach Jones and asked him for his advice. He told her, “The most important thing for you is to be surrounded by great players that you get to both play with and compete against on a daily basis.” He also told her to get as much playing time as possible. At her age, she’ll develop the most technically and physically, and especially mentally, by playing real games under pressure.</div>
		<div class="tx">He offered some other tips that Kiwi hadn’t thought of. He told  her that some teams tend to bench their second- and third-string players, so she should look for a team that offers opportunities for all the strings to play. He thinks the quality of the coaching is also important, although the competitive environment and playing time come first.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="077" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_077_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi asked Coach Jones which school he thought she should go to. Coach Jones told her that while he knows that both schools are among the best in the world for soccer, he doesn’t know enough to make a fair judgment. Instead, he promised to put Kiwi in touch with Coach Zico, a Brazilian coach who has worked with both schools in the past.</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi thanked Coach Jones profusely for his advice. She was amazed at how simply taking this one extra step led to such valuable information and opportunities. She now had specific criteria to use in evaluating a good soccer environment at Rio and Amazon, and who better to ask for advice than the venerable Brazilian coach Zico?</div>
		<div class="tx">Later that evening, as Kiwi was walking home from soccer practice, she received a call from Coach Zico. “Hey, is this Kiwi?” Coach Zico asked. “I heard from Coach Jones that you are thinking  about going to Rio or Amazon High School. Let me know how I can help.” He spoke to Kiwi for over an hour. In the end, he told her that he fully agreed with Coach Jones’s criteria for a great soccer environment.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="078" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_078_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">“I would definitely recommend that you go to Amazon,” he told her. While he thinks both schools have excellent players, it turns out they actually offer very different environments. “Rio is famous for letting only their starting lineup play games. If you’re not on the first string, you won’t get much game time. On the other hand, Amazon lets all their players play in an equal number of games. This will make a huge difference for your growth as a player.”</div>
		<div class="tx">Coach Zico also thinks Amazon offers much better coaching. Rio is known for its celebrity coaches, but they are also coaches for the adult national team and spend little time at the school. By contrast, Amazon’s coaches spend a lot of face time with their players. “These guys are not famous, but that does not mean that they are not great,” Coach Zico said. “I have met a lot of coaches in my life, but these guys are some of the best coaches I have encountered.”</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi found Coach Zico very convincing. She was so glad she got a chance to speak with him. She was now able to accurately complete the “great soccer environment” portion of her criteria-and-evaluation chart.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="079" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_079_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="080" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_080_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<h2 class="h2"><b>Finding a Great Environment to Become Bicultural and Bilingual</b></h2>
		<div class="tx1">Now Kiwi needed to determine how her two choices compared as places to become bicultural and bilingual. She contacted Rio’s admission office and received the contact information for three American students who currently attended the school. When she e-mailed the first student, she got this response: “The tailored program for foreign students is well designed. They teach all the classes at a slower pace so all of us can follow even if our Portuguese isn’t that great. But if your key goal is to become bicultural and bilingual, I would recommend you go to Amazon. The admissions office may not like what I’m telling you, but I have to be honest. You should really be in a total-immersion environment.”</div>
		<div class="tx">The second Rio student she contacted complained about the number of Americans at the school: “Rio has thirty-plus American students who all take classes together and hang out together after school and don’t mingle with local students. Sometimes it feels like I’m still living in the U.S. Many of us still can’t speak Portuguese fluently even though we’ve been here for over two years.”</div>
		<div class="tx">The third student felt the same way: “I don’t have any real local friends. If you really want to experience the culture here and learn the language, you should go to a school that only has local students. That’s how you’ll learn.”</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi was shocked by what she read, but all the students had pretty much told her the same thing. The next day, she asked a few foreign exchange students at her own school what kind of environment is best for studying abroad. Like the Rio students Kiwi contacted, they all stressed the importance of putting yourself in a total-immersion environment.</div>
		<div class="tx">With this information, Kiwi filled in the rest of her criteria-and-evaluation chart:</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="081" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_081_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Now this was getting complicated. Kiwi now realized that Amazon High School was more attractive than Rio, both as a soccer environment and as a cultural and foreign-language experience, but there was still the issue of the tuition. She somehow had to find funding if she really wanted to go to Amazon High School.</div>
		<h2 class="h2"><b>Finding Tuition Funding</b></h2>
		<div class="tx1">Kiwi tried to find an organization that would provide a scholarship for her to go to Amazon High. However, she failed miserably. Amazon did not offer any aid for foreign students. She found some government and foundation scholarships, but the deadline for applying had already passed, and the U.S. Soccer Federation didn’t have any scholarships for high school students.</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi is the last person to get depressed, but she had been uncommonly down for the last few days. After all this effort, she may have to go to Rio after all. How painful when she now knows that Amazon would be so much better.</div>
		<div class="tx">During practice on Saturday morning, Coach Jones pulled Kiwi aside for a chat. “Hey, Kiwi,” he said. “How did your conversation with Coach Zico go?”</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi replied, “Coach Jones, thanks a lot for putting me in touch with him. He gave me great advice. I am now convinced Amazon High School is the best for me. But,” she said, hanging her head, “there is one issue . . . ”</div>
		<div class="tx">Coach Jones looked concerned. “What is it?”</div>
		<div class="tx">“Well, I can’t afford the tuition. It costs five thousand dollars per year, and that is way over my budget. And I didn’t have any luck with scholarships.”</div>
		<div class="tx">Coach Jones frowned at Kiwi for a minute, then snapped his fingers. “Give me one second, Kiwi,” he said, then called someone on his cell phone. “Hey, Phil, it’s me. How’s it going? Listen, you remember Kiwi, right? The freshman striker you saw the other day?  Yeah, the one you were asking me all those questions about.” Coach Jones seemed to be talking to someone who watched Kiwi’s last game. Kiwi waited quietly, wondering where this was going.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="082" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_082_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">“Yes. . . . Right. . . . Amazon High School in Brazil. Yeah, she wants to go right away. Five thousand dollars per year. Great, I’ll have her call you. Thanks, Phil. Let’s grab lunch sometime soon.”</div>
		<div class="tx">Coach Jones disconnected the call and turned to Kiwi with a big smile. “Pack your bags, Kiwi!” he exclaimed. “You’re going to Amazon.”</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi didn’t know what to say. She wasn’t exactly sure what had happened. “Listen,” Coach Jones said. “That was the chief marketing officer at Nike. They want to sponsor you. They’re going to pay for everything—your tuition and your living expenses. They’ll even provide your gear—whatever you need. Not bad, huh? Talk to your parents about it and go meet him at his office.”</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi couldn’t believe it. For a minute she stood completely still, but then what her coach just said sank in and she jumped for joy. “Wow! That is amazing! Thanks so much, Coach Jones!”</div>
		<div>
			<a id="h4"/>
		</div>
		<h1 class="h1"><b>AT THE AIRPORT</b></h1>
		<div class="tx1">A month later, Kiwi was standing in the terminal at JFK Airport on her way to Brazil. She accepted the offer from Nike to pay for her school expenses. As she said her good-byes to her parents, her twin brothers, Coach Jones, and her teammates who came to send her off, and turned to walk through the gate, her eyes flew open wide. “I’ve seen this before, this exact scene.” She realized this was the dream she had had the night she wrote her to-do list and decided to ask Coach Jones for advice. The only difference was that she was heading off to Amazon High School, instead of Rio.</div>
		<div class="tx">Kiwi thought to herself, “I guess you can change your destiny if you try to shape it yourself.” She smiled and walked onto the plane full of great hopes.</div>
		<div class="tx">Maybe we’ll see her at the World Cup one day. Keep your heads up.</div>

		<h2 class="h2"><b>Proactively Shape Your Life by Challenging Your Decisions</b></h2>
		<div class="tx1">Sounds like Kiwi has an exciting life ahead of her, doesn’t it? You may think she was just lucky, but this all happened because she challenged her own preconceptions, because she proactively took action, and because she not only had a talent for soccer but practiced hard over the years to develop her skills. It didn’t hurt that her charming and kind personality inspired the people around her to go out of their way to help her out. As Seneca said, “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” We can learn several lessons from Kiwi:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• Spend less time worrying about things and more time thinking about actions you can take to get closer to your goals, then actually take action.</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Ask for advice. You don’t have to figure everything out on your own. Look for information to help you make the best decision in the given time.</div>
			<div class="lsl1">
				• Challenge your own thinking processes and your conclusions. Ask the following questions:
				<div class="liste">
					<div class="lsl2">• What are the pros and cons? Do I have the full list? Which option looks more attractive considering both the pros and the cons? Are the pros and cons really pros and cons? What actions could I take to enhance the pros and to minimize or eliminate the cons?</div>
					<div class="lsl2">• What are the specific criteria I should be using? Do I have the right ones? Am I weighting each criterion the right way?</div>
					<div class="lsl2">• Is my evaluation correct? What information am I basing my evaluation on? Is it accurate, up-to-date, and unbiased? What actions could I take to improve the attractiveness of my options?</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">We’ve learned a lot from Kiwi, but even she could have gone further in evaluating her options. Amazon High School is great, but was it really the best choice? She could have looked at other schools in Brazil, or in other countries that also have amazing soccer programs. Of course, she could take only so much time to make her decision, and we all face deadlines. But it’s important to always challenge our thinking and to look for other options we may have overlooked.</div>
		<div class="tx">I hope Kiwi’s story has given you some hints to help you make better decisions and improve your life.</div>
		<div class="tx">Problem solving is easy when you know how to set a clear goal, figure out how to reach it, and follow through while reviewing your progress and making changes to your plan as necessary.</div>
		<div class="tx">If you make problem solving a habit, you’ll be able to make the most of your talents and take control of your life. You can solve not only your own problems, but the problems of your school, your business, and your community—and maybe even the world.</div>
