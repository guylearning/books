			<b>ROCK BANDS AND ROOT CAUSES</b>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">Life is full of challenges. We all face obstacles as we try to accomplish our goals and dreams. Even the problems that pop up in our daily lives can be overwhelming.</div>
		<div class="tx">But that doesn’t mean you should just give up!</div>
		<div class="tx">Instead, try stepping back and figuring out the root cause of the problems and how you can overcome them.</div>
		<div class="tx">The process is very similar to how doctors treat their patients. Think about what doctors do when you visit them when you’re not well: They first ask you some questions about your symptoms and then take your temperature. They may also run blood tests or take X-rays. They are collecting information and analyzing it to identify the root cause of your illness. Only after they’ve determined the diagnosis do they decide what to prescribe, whether it’s medicine for a cold or surgery to remove a tumor. Remember the difference between the symptom (headache), the root cause (fever), and the prescription (take cold medicine). The better you get at understanding the symptoms and identifying the root causes, the better you will get at developing effective solutions.</div>
		<div class="tx">In this chapter, we’ll follow a very similar process. Here’s the approach:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">
				• Step 1: Diagnose the situation and identify the root cause of the problem.
				<div class="liste">
					<div class="lsl2">1A List all the potential root causes of the problem.</div>
					<div class="lsl2">1B Develop a hypothesis for the likely root cause.</div>
					<div class="lsl2">1C Determine the analyses and information required to test the hypothesis.</div>
					<div class="lsl2">1D Analyze and identify the root cause.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="lsl1">
				• Step 2: Develop the solution.
				<div class="liste">
					<div class="lsl2">2A Develop a wide variety of solutions to solve the problem.</div>
					<div class="lsl2">2B Prioritize actions.</div>
					<div class="lsl2">2C Develop an implementation plan.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Let’s see how this process works through a case study: a struggling young rock band called the Mushroom Lovers.</div>

		<h1 class="h1"><b>SAVE THE MUSHROOM LOVERS!</b></h1>
		<div class="tx1">Three years ago, Miss Mushroom and two of her friends, Eggplant and Tofu, formed a rock band called the Mushroom Lovers.</div>
		<div class="tx">It all started when Miss Mushroom went to see the Rolling Stones at Madison Square Garden. Right after the concert, Miss Mushroom called up Eggplant and Tofu, bursting with excitement. “Hey, we are going to start a rock band tomorrow,” she told them. “Of course, I am the singer. Eggplant, you play the guitar! Tofu, you’re going to be the drummer, all right? We’ll meet up right after school tomorrow and start practicing!”</div>
		<div class="tx">“Wait a second—” Eggplant said.</div>
		<div class="tx">“Hold on there—” Tofu said.</div>
		<div class="tx">But Miss Mushroom hung up the phone as soon as she was done doling out her instructions. Eggplant and Tofu gave a deep sigh. “Here we go again,” they said. But they both love Miss Mushroom, and whenever she really wants something, they try to do whatever it takes to make her dream come true.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="021" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_021_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">That day, Eggplant borrowed his big brother’s guitar and started teaching himself how to play. Tofu practiced playing the drums by using a pair of chopsticks and a cardboard box until he was able to  buy a used drum a year later after saving some money. Miss Mushroom’s singing was so horrible that Eggplant and Tofu had to wear earplugs to block out her noise. But over the past three years she has improved dramatically and now has a great husky voice. “We aren’t bad, eh?” Miss Mushroom said with a big smile after every rehearsal.</div>
		<div class="tx">Three months ago, Eggplant, Tofu, and Miss Mushroom were walking home from school. Eggplant and Tofu were trying to tell Miss Mushroom about their math test that afternoon, but she didn’t seem to be listening. She just kept responding, “Yup, yup” with her little nod. Her mind seemed to be somewhere else. Suddenly, she stopped walking and announced, “We are going to put on a concert at the high school gymnasium next Saturday! We’re going to do it every month now. All right?!”</div>
		<div class="tx">“Next Saturday!? That’s impossible!” said Eggplant.</div>
		<div class="tx">“The school won’t let us use the gymnasium. Students never rent the gymnasium for their personal use!” Tofu exclaimed.</div>
		<div class="tx">Miss Mushroom steamed up like a kettle. She hates hearing things like “That is impossible” or “Nobody has ever done that.”</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="022" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_022_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">“What is wrong with you guys!” she yelled. “I hate those words! We are trying to become a professional band, right? How are we going to start playing in front of big crowds if we don’t start soon? I am going to go see the principal right now and ask him to allow us to use the gymnasium. Eggplant and Tofu, you guys start letting people know about our concert. Now get to work!”</div>
		<div class="tx">Miss Mushroom turned around and ran back toward the school. Eggplant and Tofu looked at each other and sighed, “What do we do now?”</div>
		<div class="tx">Miss Mushroom is great at getting things done and doesn’t hesitate to use her charm when necessary. She got permission from the principal to use the gymnasium right away. Eggplant and Tofu told a few of their friends about the concert, and the event was held as planned.</div>
		<div class="tx">Three months passed and the Mushroom Lovers had put on three concerts. But Miss Mushroom seemed very angry again. “Why are there only fifteen people in the crowd when I am spending my precious time to put on a show!? We had only ten people at the first concert and fifteen at the second, and fifteen again at the third. What is the problem? Weren’t you guys responsible for packing the gymnasium with people? It’s already the fourth concert! Make sure the place is full this time!”</div>
		<div class="tx">Seeing Miss Mushroom’s teary eyes, Eggplant and Tofu swore to themselves to find out the root cause of their attendance problem and fill up the gymnasium for the next concert.</div>
		<h2 class="h2"><b>Diagnose the Situation and Identify the Root Cause</b></h2>
		<h3 class="h3"><b>1A. LIST ALL THE POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSES OF THE PROBLEM</b></h3>
		<div class="tx1">Very few people are coming to the Mushroom Lovers’ concerts. The band wants to find out why and what they can do about it.</div>
		<div class="tx">Let’s start with the why: Why are people not coming to the concerts? What could be the reason?</div>
		<div class="tx">It turns out that there are many potential reasons, not just one.</div>
		<div class="tx">For people to attend the concert, they must first be aware that the concert exists. Then they must want to come to the concert, and hopefully they’ll want to continue to come to other concerts after seeing the Mushroom Lovers’ amazing show.</div>
		<div class="tx">Therefore, as you can see in the following logic tree, some people may not have been aware of the concert in the first place (A); others may have been aware of the concert but either did not want to go or had another reason they could not attend (B); and others may have gone once but did not continue going to future shows (C).</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="023" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_023_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">This logic tree can also be transformed into a yes/no tree. A yes/no tree groups people or objects into buckets based on the answers to yes/no questions. By assigning everyone and everything involved to a bucket, you can more clearly see what the core issue is. For the logic tree above, the related yes/no tree creates buckets using the following questions:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">
				<b>
				1. </b> Are they aware of the concerts?
			</div>
			<div class="lsl1">
				<b>
				2. </b> If they are aware, have they ever been to a concert?
			</div>
			<div class="lsl1">
				<b>
				3. </b> If they have been to a concert, do they attend consistently?
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">
			Everybody <i>must</i> fall into one of the buckets without exception.
		</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="024" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_024_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">To identify the root cause of their attendance problem, Eggplant and Tofu need to find out the size of each bucket. Then they need to further consider the questions:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• “Why are some people not aware of the concerts?”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “Why don’t some people come to the concerts even if they are aware of them?”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “Why do some people stop coming to the concerts?”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="atx1">
			<div class="leftAligned">
				<img alt="025" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_025_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="ctBT-T">
				<b>PROBLEM-SOLVING TOOL BOX: YES/NO TREE</b>
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">You can use a yes/no tree to help you figure out a problem’s root cause or decide how to solve a problem. To create one, you answer multiple yes/no questions, like the ones Tofu and Eggplant ask in their survey.</div>
			<div class="tx">Let’s walk through another example. Imagine you’ve overslept. You were supposed to be up by 6 a.m. to take a shower, eat breakfast, and catch the 7:08 a.m. bus. Instead, you jump out of bed at 6:53. As you attempt to brush your teeth while pulling on your jeans, you think, “Why didn’t I wake up? Did my alarm go off? Is the alarm broken?”</div>
			<div class="tx">Assuming you aren’t rushing to catch a bus right now, try to create a yes/no tree that will help you figure out why you weren’t able to wake up. Write down a question, then consider whether a yes or no answer will lead to an explanation (a bucket) or another question. Repeat this process for each further question until you’ve created buckets for all the possible explanations.</div>
			<div class="tx">How did it go? Here’s one possible yes/no tree for why you weren’t able to wake up. Your tree doesn’t have to look exactly like the one shown here, but it should have used yes/no questions to help you discover all the potential causes for oversleeping.</div>

			</div>
		</div>
		<h3 class="h3"><b>1B. DEVELOP A HYPOTHESIS FOR THE LIKELY ROOT CAUSE</b></h3>
		<div class="tx1">Now let’s come up with a hypothesis that explains why people aren’t attending the concerts.</div>
		<div class="tx">A hypothesis is a hunch. It’s what you think is the most likely explanation for your problem, but you haven’t yet confirmed it.</div>
		<div class="tx">By determining your hypothesis and thinking through the reasoning that underlies it, you will be able to check whether it’s right. From there, you can move on to making a sound decision that will lead to a productive solution.</div>
		<div class="tx">Let’s take an everyday example: Say one day you decide to visit your grandma who lives in a town thirty miles away. However, you realize it’s the day after Thanksgiving, and every store in town is having a big sale. People will be rushing to the mall, which means traffic will be horrible. You want to spend as much quality time  with your grandma as possible, but you need to be home by 10 p.m. because you have an early baseball practice the next day.</div>
		<div class="tx">What happens if you just jump into action without thinking first? You always visit grandma by bus, so today is no exception. You buy a ticket, get a seat, and end up spending two hours on the bus stuck in traffic. By the time you get to grandma’s house, you barely have time to kiss her on the cheek before hopping back on the bus again for the grueling trip home.</div>
		<div class="tx">If you had stopped to think before taking the bus, the trip might have worked out differently. By making a hypothesis about the potential traffic and finding an easy way to check its validity, you would have been able to find the best travel solution and could have spent more time with your grandmother.</div>
		<div class="tx">Your hypothesis could have been, “I should take the train instead of the bus because the traffic will be bad.” The rationale for this hypothesis could then be, “The traffic must be bad because the day-after-Thanksgiving sales are going on.” Fortunately, in this situation there is a quick and effective way to check your hypothesis. All you have to do is to turn on the radio or the TV and listen to the traffic report. You could also call your friend who said she was going to take the bus to see a football game and ask her about the traffic on the way there. Once you have that additional information, you could make your final decision.</div>
		<div class="tx">This procedure is something you probably would do naturally without giving it too much thought, right? You’re already a successful hypothesizer. That’s all there is to it.</div>
		<div class="tx">Now let’s get back to the Mushroom Lovers. Eggplant and Tofu have come up with a hypothesis for their attendance problem: The root cause is awareness. People are not attending because they don’t even know about the concerts in the first place.</div>
		<div class="tx">Let’s examine their rationale:</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="028" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_028_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">They think awareness must be low because they didn’t try very hard to get the word out. As Tofu says, “We told only a few of the kids who sit next to us in class, and Miss Mushroom probably didn’t invite anybody because even though she’s bossy she’s actually really shy.” Their hypothesis is that only about one in twenty people at their school (about 5 percent) even know about the concert.</div>
		<div class="tx">Next, they estimate that 60 percent of the people who find out about the concert would probably show up. Their rationale for this estimate is based on their guess that about 60 percent of the people at their school actually like rock music, and, according to Eggplant, “If you like rock music and find out there’s a concert at your school, you’d definitely come. I would!”</div>
		<div class="tx">Finally, they assume that the audience return rate of the people who keep coming to the concerts after seeing a show is 100 percent.  They try to remember who was in the crowd at the last three concerts. The gymnasium was pretty dark, and they were busy rocking out, so they aren’t exactly sure who was there. “I think everyone in the crowd was about the same every time,” Tofu says. “Since we’re pretty good, once they hear us play, how could they not keep coming? Let’s say one hundred percent of the people are continuing to come.”</div>
		<div class="tx">By this reasoning, they conclude that their biggest issue is awareness. If this hypothesis is true, they should focus on figuring out a way to raise awareness. So let’s see if they’re right.</div>
		<h3 class="h3"><b>1C. DETERMINE THE ANALYSES AND INFORMATION REQUIRED TO TEST HYPOTHESIS</b></h3>
		<div class="tx1">Now Eggplant and Tofu need to test their hypothesis. To do this, they need to do some research.</div>
		<div class="tx">This is where the information collection and analysis part of the problem-solving process comes into play. You’re not collecting information just for the sake of collecting it, or analyzing it just for fun. You’re doing it to help you make better decisions.</div>
		<div class="tx">So what kind of analyses do Eggplant and Tofu have to conduct? And what information do they need to conduct these analyses?</div>
		<div>
			 <br/></div>
		<div class="tx1">
			<b>Analysis #1: How many people are in each “awareness” category?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">Take a look at Eggplant and Tofu’s hypothesis diagram again. We can group the people at the Mushroom Lovers’ school into four different groups: (1) not aware of the concert; (2) aware but not attending; (3) attended at least once; and (4) attending regularly. So how do we figure out how many people fall into each of these buckets?</div>
		<div class="tx">It would be time consuming and difficult to meet all 500 people at the school and ask them one by one which group they fall into. Even if Miss Mushroom helped and they divided up the task, if they asked one person each day, it would take nearly half a year (167 days). So, what should they do?</div>
		<div class="tx">After a brainstorming session on how to get the information they need, Eggplant and Tofu decide to create a list of questions and ask all the teachers to conduct a survey during Monday morning homeroom. The teachers need to ask only these three questions and write down how many students raise their hands for each one (and count their own answers as well):</div>
		<div class="atx1">
			<div class="tx1">
				<b>
				1. </b> Raise your hand if you already know about the Mushroom Lovers’ monthly concerts.
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">
				<b>
				2. </b> If you knew about the Mushroom Lovers’ concerts, raise your hand if you’ve ever been to one.
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">
				<b>
				3. </b> If you have been to a Mushroom Lovers’ concert, raise your hand if you are attending them regularly.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">This survey is easy and efficient. It won’t take more than three minutes for the teachers to ask the questions.</div>
		<div>
			 <br/></div>
		<div class="tx1">
			<b>Analysis #2: Why do some people who know about the concerts not attend?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">Next, Eggplant and Tofu have to figure out why some people are not attending the concerts even though they are aware of them. If they had time and a lot of resources, Eggplant and Tofu could conduct a big person-by-person survey of everyone in the school. But that probably isn’t necessary. If they interview about five people, they should get a pretty good idea of the main reasons. They decide to ask the teachers to jot down a few names of the people who knew about the concerts but had never attended, so they can interview them later.</div>
		<div>
			 <br/></div>
		<div class="tx1">
			<b>Analysis #3: Why are some people not attending regularly?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">
			<b>Will people attend regularly in the future?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">Interviewing about five people will give Eggplant and Tofu a pretty good idea about the answer to these questions as well. They decide to ask for input on the good and bad points of their past concerts.  They hope they’ll get valuable hints on how to improve to make sure people will keep coming back to their future shows. They know it’s much easier to retain loyal fans than it is to find new ones.</div>
		<div class="tx">Remember, Eggplant and Tofu’s hypothesis is that once people come to one show, they’ll continue to attend, but that may not necessarily be the case. They decide to reach out to anyone who stopped coming and find out why. Hopefully, they can learn how to turn one-time attendees into future regular fans.</div>
		<div class="tx">People often fall into the trap of collecting information and conducting analyses just for the sake of doing them. Don’t forget that the point of all this research is to help you make informed decisions. Try to collect and analyze information efficiently and effectively. This will help you make better use of your limited time and resources.</div>

			<div class="ctBT-T">
				<b>PROBLEM-SOLVING TOOL BOX: PROBLEM-SOLVING DESIGN PLAN</b>
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">If you start collecting and analyzing data without first clarifying the question you are trying to answer, you’re probably doing yourself more harm than good. You’ll end up drowning in a flood of information and realize only later that most of that research was a waste of time.</div>
			<div class="tx">To avoid this problem, you should develop a problem-solving design plan before you start chasing after information. In the design plan, you clarify the issues you are trying to solve, state your current hypotheses and rationale, and list the analyses, actions, and information required to prove or disprove those hypotheses. Developing this plan before you start researching will drastically increase your problem-solving productivity.</div>
			<div class="tx">Additionally, putting your plan down on paper will not only clarify your thoughts. If you’re working in a group, this plan will also help your team focus on what needs to be done and provide the jumping-off point for your group brainstorming. You will be able to focus on only what you really need to know to make a decision.</div>
			<div class="tx">Eggplant and Tofu’s problem-solving design plan looks like this:</div>

		<h3 class="h3"><b>1D. ANALYZE AND IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE</b></h3>
		<div class="tx1">
			<b>Analysis #1: How many people are in each “awareness” category?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">The teachers agreed to conduct the survey for Eggplant and Tofu, and the data poured in. They added together all the responses and came up with the following results:</div>
		<div>
			 <br/></div>
		<div class="tx">Potential concert attendees: 500 students and teachers</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• Question #1: Did you already know about the Mushroom Lovers’ concerts?</div>
			<div class="lsl1">
				• Answer #1: Yes=150 people (30%)
				<div class="ctag1">No=350 people (70%)</div>
			</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Question #2: If you knew about the Mushroom Lovers’ concerts, have you ever been to one?</div>
			<div class="lsl1">
				• Answer #2: Yes=15 people (10%)
				<div class="ctag1">No=135 people (90%)</div>
			</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Question #3: If you have been to a Mushroom Lovers’ concert, do you attend them regularly?</div>
			<div class="lsl1">
				• Answer #3: Yes=12 people (80%)
				<div class="ctag1">No=3 people (20%)</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">With this data, Tofu and Eggplant are able to figure out the breakdown of people into each bucket:</div>
		<div class="lsl1">a. People who are not aware of the concerts: 350 people (70%)</div>
		<div class="lsl1">b. People who are aware but have never been to a concert: 135 people (27%)</div>
		<div class="lsl1">c. People who have been to a concert once but stopped coming: 3 people (1%)</div>
		<div class="lsl1">d. People who attend the concerts consistently: 12 people (2%)</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="032" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_032_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Eggplant and Tofu assumed people weren’t coming to the concerts mainly because they didn’t know about them, and that once everybody became aware, about 60 percent of the people would start coming (about 300 people).</div>
		<div class="tx">But when they looked at their data, they found that 30 percent of the people were already aware of the concerts, not the 5 percent they’d assumed. It appears that the people Eggplant and Tofu invited directly and the people who came to the show talked about it and spread the word.</div>
		<div class="tx">On the other hand, while they thought 60 percent of the people who knew about the concerts were coming, they learned the ratio was actually only 10 percent! There are many people who knew about the concerts and didn’t attend. It seems that just improving the school’s awareness of the concert will not drive more people to  come out to watch them play. They decide that they need to find out why people are not willing to come.</div>
		<div class="tx">However, their estimate on the percentage of people who continued to return to their concerts after attending once was not far off: That turned out to be 80 percent, compared to their initial estimate of 100 percent. But now that they know some people stopped attending, they want to find out why.</div>
		<div class="tx">As you can see, the outcome of the analysis is often at odds with the original hypothesis. What would happen if Eggplant and Tofu had acted on their original hypothesis without checking to see if it was correct? They probably would have put up posters and distributed flyers all over the school and ended up increasing the number of spectators by a marginal amount. (Because no matter how much they raised awareness, only 10 percent of the people who knew about the show would likely come.) This is why you should test your hypothesis if you can figure out an efficient way to do so.</div>
		<div class="tx">The following chart summarizes the difference between Eggplant and Tofu’s original hypothesis and the actual results of their research.</div>

		</div>
		<div class="tx1">
			<b>Analysis #2: Why do some people who know about the concerts not attend?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">Eggplant and Tofu have found out that there are a lot of people who know about the concerts but choose not to attend. In order to figure out why, they interview five people who belong to this group.</div>
		<div class="tx">They get a wide range of feedback:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• “Yup, I heard that you are doing a concert every month. Why don’t I go? Well, I don’t know what kind of music you guys play, and to be honest, I don’t know how good you guys are. . . . ”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “I don’t know you guys. I heard rumors about your band, but I was like, ‘Who are they?’”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “Are you kidding me? You guys are a middle school band, how can you be worth watching on a Saturday? I bet everyone thinks you guys must suck, anyway.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “I really wanted to go, but the concert is at noon on Saturdays, right? I have baseball games then. . . . Frank and Mike couldn’t go for the same reason.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “I have no interest in music. I don’t even listen to music at home. Why would I go?”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">From these comments, they determine that there are three main reasons people are not attending the Mushroom Lovers’ shows:</div>
		<div class="atx1">
			<div class="tx1">
				<b>
				1. </b> “They don’t know what kind of music we’re playing or how good we are.”
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">
				<b>
				2. </b> “The show time doesn’t work for their schedule.”
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">
				<b>
				3. </b> “They’re not interested in music in the first place.”

		<div class="tx">“Interesting!” Tofu exclaims. “It may be tough to get people who are not interested in music to come, but we could definitely do something about people who are not coming because they don’t know what kind of music we play or how good we are, and people whose schedules don’t work.” Eggplant and Tofu conduct ten additional  interviews and figure out that more people would be able to come if they moved the concert to Saturday evening. “Wow,” Eggplant says. “I think we can do something about this!” They’re starting to feel hopeful now that they have a much better understanding of the root cause of their problem.</div>

			<b>Analysis #3: Why are some people not attending regularly?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">
			<b>Will people attend regularly in the future?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">Last, Eggplant and Tofu interview five people to find out why some people stop attending the concerts and if more of their fans are likely to drop out in the future.</div>
		<div class="tx">Here’s the feedback they receive:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• “I love you guys! You guys should be a professional band! I am going to brag to everyone that I was at your first show! Of course, I am going to go to every one of your concerts!”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “Mushroom’s husky voice is so soulful! I cried a bit when she sang the ballad. . . . I’ll always be there!”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “I think most of the people were pleasantly surprised with how great you guys are. But, all the songs you guys performed were the same all three times. If you guys keep playing the same songs, the crowd may start getting bored.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “Eggplant, I loved your guitar solo! I used to think you were just Mushroom’s sidekick. . . . what a surprise! There may be days that I can’t make it, but I will go as much as possible!”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “Love the music, but it gets boring when you keep playing the same songs over and over again. . . . You’ve got to keep the crowd on their toes, keep it fresh. Don’t you get bored as well, performing the same songs at every concert?”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">It seems like the overall satisfaction level is very high. The two were so happy to get feedback directly from their fans. While it’s nice to get praise, sometimes it can be tough to listen to criticism, but both are important when you’re trying to figure out how to improve. It appears as though these two are starting to think like professional musicians.</div>
		<div class="tx">Their key finding in these interviews was the fact that the crowd will get bored and may stop coming if they continue to play the same songs over and over again.</div>
		<div class="tx">Next, they interview the three people who stopped coming and ask them why they no longer show up. All three answered, “Because you guys keep playing the same songs in the same way, so I got bored.” Now it is clear that they need to do something about their show. They need to add some “freshness” to their performances.</div>
		<div class="tx">By collecting information and conducting analyses, Eggplant and Tofu have disproved their hypothesis and now have a better understanding of the root cause for their lack of concert attendance.</div>
		<div class="tx">Now they are one step closer to achieving their goal of making Miss Mushroom happy by filling up the gymnasium. They’re both looking forward to performing in front of a packed crowd themselves—and one day debuting as a professional rock band.</div>

		<h2 class="h2"><b>Develop the Solution</b></h2>
		<h3 class="h3"><b>2A. DEVELOP A WIDE VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM</b></h3>
		<div class="tx1">Eggplant and Tofu now have a great understanding of the root causes of their problem. But if they stop here, all their hard work won’t have done them any good. Now they have to move on to developing solutions.</div>
		<div class="tx">Throughout their interviews and analyses, the two realized that they not only need to let people know about the concert; they have to make them want to come as well.</div>
		<div class="tx">They create a logic tree to help them list the different ways they could get the word out about their show. As you can see, there are many ways to communicate—including newspapers and magazines, message boards, and e-mail—that could be much more effective than just the two of them simply telling people about the show in person. What is important at this stage is that Eggplant and Tofu don’t shoot down any ideas early by saying, “Radio? Newspapers? That’s impossible!” They list as many ideas as they can and save thinking about their feasibility and impact for later. Even if some ideas sound kind of crazy, they may actually lead to interesting and creative solutions. The key rule here is to list as much as possible and then prioritize later.</div>
		<div class="tx">Once Eggplant and Tofu write down all the ideas they can think of, they highlight the potentially interesting communication tools on their logic tree and have an intense discussion on how to best use them to effectively bring people to their concerts.</div>
		<div class="tx">As they go through their options, the two keep in mind their need not just to raise awareness but also to make people want to come to the concerts. For example, when they communicate through the high school radio program, if they announce just the date, time, and location of the concert, all they will do is raise awareness. But if they also air their song on the radio, people will hear what kind of  music they play and how great they are, thereby, hopefully, driving up the number of people who’ll want to come to the concert.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="035" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_035_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">By staying focused on both these goals, Eggplant and Tofu are making use of the knowledge they gained in the analysis process. If they ignore all that their data tells them, all their work would be for naught. Here’s the list of communication routes they decided to look into. They checked off whether each action would (1) make people aware of the show, and (2) make people actually want to attend.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="036" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_036_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="037" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_037_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Eggplant and Tofu added three additional actions to their list based on the findings from their interviews. They decided to change the starting time of the concert and also figured out a way to keep the concert fresh. This is what they came up with:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">11 Change the concert starting time to 5 p.m.</div>
			<div class="lsl1">12 Switch 20 percent of the songs to new songs and change the song order to keep the concert fresh.</div>
			<div class="lsl1">13 Have Tofu tell jokes and stories about the band between songs to entertain the crowd.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Now they have thirteen ideas. But can they implement all of them with less than one month until the next concert? Some of the  ideas are time consuming and laborious, and others will require some money to execute.</div>
		<div class="tx">Eggplant and Tofu are operating with limited time and money. They decide that they’ll need to prioritize their ideas to decide which ones they should actually pursue.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="038" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_038_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<h3 class="h3"><b>2B. PRIORITIZE THE ACTIONS</b></h3>
		<div class="tx1">How should Eggplant and Tofu prioritize their actions? They decide to make their key criteria the potential impact of the action and its ease of implementation, as you can see in the matrix on page 51.</div>
		<div class="tx">To create the matrix, they rated the impact, from high to low, on the vertical axis. On the horizontal axis, they plotted the ease of implementation, from hard to easy. The best solutions fall in the top right box, with high impact and easy implementation. The least effective solutions fall in the lower left box, with low impact and hard implementation.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="039" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_039_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">For example, let’s see where they should plot number 1 (Perform in each class during homeroom). The impact of this action should be very high: It will not only raise awareness of the concert, but when people hear in person how great the Mushroom Lovers are, they’ll want to come to the shows to hear more. However, the ease of implementation is hard because it will take a lot of time to set up and play in each of the twelve classrooms. Therefore, Eggplant and Tofu put it in the top left box of the matrix.</div>
		<div class="tx">Let’s try one more. How about number 6 (Put the concert details up on each class’s message board)? Where should they plot this action? The impact is low because very few people look at the message board on any given day, and even if some people were to read the concert details, this will only raise their awareness. Reading the details won’t necessarily make people any more inclined to attend the show. However, the ease of implementation is easy because all they have to do is write the details on the message boards. Therefore, Eggplant and Tofu plotted it in the lower right box.</div>
		<h3 class="h3"><b>2C. DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</b></h3>
		<div class="tx1">So, which actions should Eggplant and Tofu implement? Their first priority should be the actions in the top right box because their impact is high and the ease of implementation is easy. The next priorities are the actions in the top left or bottom right boxes. The least attractive are the ones in the bottom left box.</div>
		<div class="tx">Eggplant and Tofu have been prioritizing their actions based on the assumption that they would be doing everything on their own. However, what if they seek help from others?</div>
		<div class="tx">For example, take number 4 (Make cool posters and put them up around school). None of the members of the Mushroom Lovers are good at art, and none has experience creating posters, so they plotted it in the left bottom box (low impact and hard ease of implementation). However, Tofu realized, “What if we ask John Octopus to create a poster for us? He would be able to create a really cool one easily!” By asking John to create the poster, the plot for action number 4 moves from the left bottom box to the right top box, as you can see above.</div>

			<img alt="040" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_040_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Similarly, they plotted #8 (Create a CD to hand out to the students with a note about the next concert) as high impact but hard ease of implementation because they don’t know how to create a CD. However, they know there must be someone in their class who knows how to create one. They can also ask someone to help them out with number 10 (Create a website).</div>
		<div class="tx">By getting help from others, they were able to pursue all thirteen ideas. People have different strengths. You can accomplish more by collaborating with others who have strengths you may lack.</div>
		<div class="tx">While Eggplant and Tofu were able to implement all their ideas, that is not always the case. Remember to prioritize your actions and then develop your implementation plan.</div>

		<h1 class="h1"><b>THE NEXT MUSHROOM LOVERS’ CONCERT</b></h1>
		<div class="tx1">So, what happened at the Mushroom Lovers’ next concert?</div>
		<div class="tx">The month until the next show quickly passed, and Miss Mushroom, Eggplant, and Tofu took the stage once again. When they finished performing their favorite song, “The 3,” the gymnasium was silent. It sounded like someone had hit the Mute button on a giant TV remote.</div>
		<div class="tx">The Mushroom Lovers looked nervously out into the darkened gymnasium. Then the room quickly filled with the sound of clapping and cheering. It was so loud the gymnasium started shaking.</div>
		<div class="tx">Eggplant and Tofu’s efforts paid off! Two hundred people came to watch the concert!</div>
		<div class="tx">“Mushroom! Mushroom! Tofu! Tofu! Eggplant! Eggplant!” The crowd chanted. They didn’t let up.</div>
		<div class="tx">The three band mates looked bashfully at one another. Their eyes were all filled with tears.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="041" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_041_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Seeing Eggplant and Tofu crying, Miss Mushroom shouted out, “Hey, you two! Why are you crying!? Don’t get so emotional!” Then she suddenly stopped yelling and pulled both of them into a big hug as tears poured down her cheeks.</div>
		<div class="tx">“Thank you,” she said. “Thank you so much, you two.”</div>
		<div class="tx">The Mushroom Lovers’ fourth concert was a big success. By raising awareness to 90 percent and getting 50 percent of the people who knew about the show to come, Eggplant and Tofu drew in more than 200 people. And what’s more, 90 percent of those people are planning to come again!</div>
