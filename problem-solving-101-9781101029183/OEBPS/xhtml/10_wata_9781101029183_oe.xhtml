		<h1 class="h1"><b>BREAK DOWN A BIG DREAM INTO SMALLER GOALS</b></h1>
		<div class="tx1">Problem-solving kids don’t just have big dreams; they go after their larger goals by breaking them down into smaller milestones and asking themselves, “What should I do this year, or in the next three months, or today?” These milestones guide problem-solving kids toward their dreams and help to keep them motivated. Once they lay out a plan for achieving a dream, they then figure out the most effective way to achieve each smaller goal and to take the actions needed.</div>
		<div class="tx">In this class, we’re going to see how John Octopus, the Mushroom Lovers’ excellent poster designer, tries to achieve his goal. John dreams of going to Hollywood and becoming an animator and a movie director working in computer-generated imagery. For now, his first goal is to buy a computer that will help him learn CGI animation.</div>
		<div class="tx">There’s a proven problem-solving kids’ process for figuring out how to achieve such a goal.</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• Step 1: Set a clear goal.</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Step 2: Determine the gap between the goal and the current situation.</div>
			<div class="lsl1">
				• Step 3: Form a hypothesis about how to close the gap and achieve the goal.
				<div class="liste">
					<div class="lsl2">3A List as many options and ideas as possible.</div>
					<div class="lsl2">3B Select the best ideas as the hypothesis.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="lsl1">
				• Step 4: Check the hypothesis. Go back to step 3 if the hypothesis is disproved.
				<div class="liste">
					<div class="lsl2">4A Determine the analyses and information required to test the hypothesis.</div>
					<div class="lsl2">4B Analyze and develop action plan.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Let’s see how this process works out for John.</div>
		<div>

		</div>
		<h1 class="h1"><b>JOHN’S BIG DREAM AND FIRST GOAL</b></h1>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="043" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_043_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">Meet John. John went with his friend Sarah to see a CGI movie the other day, and he loved it. The animation was great, and the characters looked so real he could have sworn they were alive. It was a great story, too. Now he wants to become a Hollywood CGI movie director. He’s already imagining the magazine headlines: “Innovative CGI director John Octopus wins the Academy Award,” with a photo of him in a tuxedo, holding his Oscar.</div>
		<div class="tx">But there’s one problem. . . .</div>
		<div class="tx">John has no clue how to create computer-generated animation. In fact, he doesn’t even own a computer. So first he needs to figure out how to buy a computer. He’d like to get some design practice by creating his family’s holiday card. That means he’ll need to get the computer by early December at the latest, which is only six months away.</div>
		<div class="tx">He knows he needs to come up with a great plan!</div>
		<div>
			<a id="h3"/>
		</div>
		<h1 class="h1"><b>STEP 1: SET A CLEAR GOAL</b></h1>
		<div class="tx1">John’s first step is to set a clear goal. So what should his goal be? Take a moment and imagine you’re John and write down on a piece of paper your idea for John’s goal.</div>
		<div class="tx">What was your answer?</div>
		<div class="tx">Maybe you simply wrote down, “I want a computer” or “Buy a computer.” However, these aren’t the best answers. It is important to be more specific.</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• Bad examples: “I want a computer”; “Buy a computer.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Good example: “I want to buy a $500 used Apple computer within six months without borrowing money from others.”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">The first example is ambiguous. It doesn’t clearly state what John wants, when he wants it, or how he wants to obtain it. In the second example, these details are clarified.</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• “What do I want?”=“A $500 used Apple computer.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “When do I want it?”=“Within six months.”</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• “How do I want to get it?”=“I want to buy it without borrowing money from others.”</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">John has to determine what type of computer would best fit his needs. There are many different types of computers out there. Some are fine for e-mailing and composing documents. Others are better for CGI use, but they can be more expensive. John visited computer shops and searched the Internet, and finally found a computer he likes, a cool-looking $500 used Apple computer. Now he has a specific goal and a number to shoot for.</div>
		<div class="tx">Next he needs to specify when he wants it. The best way for him to close the gap between his current situation (no computer) and his goal (buy a computer) changes depending on when he actually needs the computer. If he just wants a computer within the next three years, he may be able to buy it by simply saving his money. However, if he wants to buy it within the next six months, he may have to do more than save. He may have to look for new sources of income.</div>
		<div class="tx">If you have specific conditions for achieving your goal, you should include them in the goal statement. In John’s case, he clarified that he wants to buy his computer, not borrow or rent it, and he does not want to borrow money from others to do so.</div>
		<div class="tx">The more specific the goal is, the more specific the action plan will be. Whenever you set a goal, get into the habit of asking yourself, “What specifically do I want to achieve? When do I want to achieve it? What specific conditions do I have?”</div>
		<h2 class="h2"><b>Step 2: Determine the Gap Between the Goal and Current Situation</b></h2>
		<div class="tx1">Once you set a clear goal, you need to identify the gap between your goal and your current situation. If the gap is small, the solution  may be very obvious. But if the gap is large, you may have to really think through how to achieve the goal.</div>
		<div class="tx">Let’s look at John’s case.</div>
		<div class="tx">John currently has $150 in savings. His parents give him an allowance of $20 per month, and he earns $3 per hour walking the neighbor’s dog once a week, which amounts to $12 per month. But he spends $15 per month, on average.</div>
		<div class="tx">Will John be able to buy the computer if he maintains his current level of income and spending? To figure this out, he needs to calculate his projected savings in six months at the current rate. If that amount is more than $500, he will be able to buy the computer without making any changes.</div>
		<div class="tx">Projected savings in six months:</div>
		<div class="atx1">
			<div class="tx1">
				Current savings + number of months x [monthly allowance + <br/>(monthly dog-walking income) - average monthly spending]=
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">$150 + 6 x [$20 + ($3/hour x 1hour/week x 4 weeks/month) - $15]=</div>
		<div>
			 <br/></div>
		<div class="tx1">$252</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="044" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_044_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">John figured out that his projected savings would be $252. That means he won’t be able to buy the computer if he continues at his current rate of income. He will have to find out a way to fill the gap of $248.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="045" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_045_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<h2 class="h2"><b>Form a Hypothesis</b></h2>
		<h3 class="h3"><b>3A. LIST AS MANY OPTIONS AND IDEAS TO CLOSE THE GAP AS POSSIBLE</b></h3>
		<div class="tx1">John now knows he has to do something extra in order to close the gap. So what should he do? Take a moment to list a few ideas. Be specific as possible.</div>
		<div class="tx">What did you come up with? Were you able to think of a wide variety of ideas? Sometimes it’s hard to break out of your current way of thinking and come up with innovative ideas. It might be tempting to come up with a list like this:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• Ask Mom to increase allowance.</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Save money.</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Buy a lottery ticket.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">The first idea probably won’t work because John wants to achieve his goal on his own. The second is not specific enough, and the third seems like a long shot. Some people might just give up at this point and decide it will be impossible to save the extra money.</div>
		<div class="tx">However, by using the logic tree introduced in Class #1, you will be able to come up with a wide variety of more specific ideas. Let’s check out the logic tree John has created:</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="046" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_046_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">He started at the left with his main problem (How can I buy a $500 used Apple computer in six months without borrowing money from others?). Then he split the first branch into “Increase income” and “Reduce spending.”</div>
		<div class="tx">John thought about how he could increase his income. He created two new branches: “Money from others” and “Self-generated income.”</div>
		<div class="tx">On the “Reduce spending” side, he broke his spending down into the categories of “Entertainment,” “Food and beverages,” and “Other.”</div>
		<div class="tx">To make the tree grow vertically, repeatedly ask yourself, “Are there other ways of solving the problem?” You can grow the tree horizontally by asking, “Specifically how or what falls into this category?” In this manner, you’ll end up developing a wide variety of specific ideas.</div>
		<h3 class="h3"><b>3B) SELECT THE BEST IDEAS AS YOUR HYPOTHESIS</b></h3>
		<div class="tx1">Once John created his logic tree, he started to look for the best ideas so he could come up with a hypothesis for how he could close the $248 gap.</div>
		<div class="tx">You can cut a branch out of your logic tree if the idea is clearly not effective or feasible, or if it goes against your values. For example, in John’s case, he cut out the whole “Money from others” branch because his goal is to solve this problem on his own rather than relying on other people for help. He also cut out the branch “Increase working time” because he needs to continue practicing baseball and doing his schoolwork, and he can’t afford to spend more time working. He cut out “Invest” and “Play the lottery” because he does not know how to invest, and he has a very low probability of winning the lottery.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="047" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_047_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">By cutting out branches and highlighting what he sees as the best ideas on the tree, John is able to come up with a hypothesis: “I can buy the computer within six months if I switch to a higher-paying job, sell some used books, and stop purchasing CDs and games.”</div>
		<div class="tx">John used the following hypothesis pyramid to portray this. It shows the main hypothesis (I can buy a $500 used Apple computer within six months), with the specific conditions (the “hows”) as the base supporting the main hypothesis.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="048" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_048_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">So, why is this still a hypothesis and not John’s actual solution? It remains a hypothesis because we still don’t know if it is true.</div>
		<div class="tx">For example, part of John’s hypothesis is that he should switch to a higher-paying job. He thinks this might be possible because he heard that one of his friends, Kevin, earns $8 per hour. However, John does not know what job Kevin actually has, whether he has the capability to do the same job, and whether such a job is even available.</div>
		<div class="tx">But when you set a clear hypothesis and rationale, you are more able to collect information and conduct analyses efficiently, and discover if your hypothesis is true.</div>
		<div class="atx1">
			<div class="leftAligned">
				<img alt="049" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_049_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="ctBT-T">
				<b>PROBLEM-SOLVING TOOL BOX: HYPOTHESIS PYRAMID</b>
			</div>
			<div class="tx1">The hypothesis pyramid is a great tool for structuring your argument. Using it to clarify your conclusion and rationale before diving into data collection and analysis will improve your productivity dramatically. It’s also useful for communicating your hypothesis to others.</div>
			<div class="tx">The basic structure places the conclusion or main message at the top and lists the supporting rationales on the bottom, like the supporting bricks of a pyramid.</div>
			<div class="tx">Let’s try out a couple of examples and see how it works. Rearrange the boxes in each of the following problems to create a pyramid structure that shows the relationship between them.</div>
			<div class="centerAligned">
				<img alt="050" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_050_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="tx">There are two main types of hypothesis pyramid: the grouping structure and the argument structure. Problem 1 above is an example of the grouping structure. The conclusion “School is fun” is supported by separate but coherent ideas like “School sports are fun,” “Lunchtime is fun,” and “Classes are fun.”</div>
			<div class="tx">The supporting blocks can be answers to questions like why, how, and what asked about the argument block at the top of the pyramid. For the grouping structure, even if one of the supporting building blocks proves to be wrong, the argument still holds. In this case, you could still make an argument that “School is fun” even if “Classes are fun” proves to be false.</div>
			<div class="tx">Problem 2 is an example of an argument structure. In this kind of pyramid, multiple statements (“Salmon are fish,” “Fish are good swimmers”) lead to a conclusion: Salmon are good swimmers. Unlike the grouping structure, with an argument structure, if one of the statements is untrue, the main conclusion is automatically false.</div>
			<div class="centerAligned">
				<img alt="051" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_051_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2 class="h2"><b>Step 4: Check the hypothesis</b></h2>
		<h3 class="h3"><b>4A. DETERMINE THE ANALYSES AND INFORMATION REQUIRED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS</b></h3>
		<div class="tx1">Once he comes up with a hypothesis for how he will achieve his goal, John’s next step is to figure out what analyses and information will be required to test his hypothesis. As you can see in the following, John used a problem-solving design plan to clarify the issues, his hypotheses and rationale, and the analyses and information required.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="052" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_052_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">In order to test his first hypothesis, “I can reduce most of my spending if I stop buying CDs and games,” John decides to analyze his spending over the past three months. He will create a list of his purchases from his receipts, using his memory to fill in any gaps. By separating his purchases into categories, he will get a better idea of what he should cut and how much the impact will be.</div>
		<div class="tx">He comes up with similar plans of actions for the other two hypotheses, as shown in the design plan above.</div>
		<div class="tx">Now it is clear what he has to do:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• Spending breakdown and spending cut identification</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Sellable assets search and sell-price research</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Part-time-job-pay interviews with friends</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Part-time-job-availability interviews with neighbors</div>
		</div>
		<h3 class="h3"><b>4B. ANALYZE AND DEVELOP ACTION PLAN</b></h3>
		<div class="tx1">John next moves on to his analyses. First he tries to figure out how much he can reduce his spending.</div>
		<div>
			 <br/></div>
		<div class="tx1">
			<b>Analysis #1: How much can John reduce his spending?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">He starts by trying to remember and list everything he bought in the past three months: “Okay, last month I bought a $9 video game and a $1 candy bar. What else? Oh, I buy comic books every month for $4, and I buy a sports drink after every baseball game on Saturday.”</div>
		<div class="tx">Using this very rigorous scientific process, John comes up with the following spending data for the past three months:</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="053" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_053_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Next he figures out how much he spent on average each month on each type of purchase and creates the following pie chart:</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="054" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_054_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">When he looks at the pie chart, John realizes that his hypothesis that he could reduce most of his spending by not purchasing CDs and video games is wrong. He actually spends the most money on sports drinks and comic books. Even though they are less expensive than the CDs and video games, he buys them much more frequently.</div>
		<div class="tx">John is troubled by his findings. “Do I have to give up sports drinks? And my favorite comic books, too?” he wonders. “I get so thirsty after baseball games, and if I stop reading comic books I will be left out when my friends talk about them at school.” It seems there are things John is willing to give up and others that he is not.</div>
		<div class="tx">Things John could give up:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• Listening to new CDs</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Playing new games</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Things John does not want to give up:</div>
		<div class="liste">
			<div class="lsl1">• Drinking sports drink after baseball practice</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Reading comic books</div>
			<div class="lsl1">• Eating candy</div>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">To determine how he will reduce his spending, John has to consider both how much eliminating a purchase will decrease his spending and whether he can give it up until he reaches his goal. Like the Mushroom Lovers in the previous class, John uses a matrix to organize his thoughts:</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="055" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_055_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">As you can see, he ranks average spending per month on the vertical axis. On the horizontal axis, he places items he cannot give up on the left and items he can give up on the right.</div>
		<div class="tx">When he plots his purchases on the matrix, it immediately becomes clear that he should give up CDs and video games. They fall in the top right box, meaning they are both easy to give up and have a large impact on his monthly spending. On the other hand,  candy falls in the bottom left box, meaning he does not spend a lot on it and does not want to give it up. Since candy doesn’t have a large impact on his spending, he decides he need not bother giving it up.</div>
		<div class="tx">But how about comic books and sports drinks? Although he does not want to give them up, if he can reduce these costs, they will have a large impact on his overall spending. John decides to brainstorm ways he can cut back on these purchases.</div>
		<div class="tx">He comes up with some brilliant ideas. Instead of buying sports drinks at the baseball diamond, he realizes he can buy a much cheaper powdered sports drink mix, make it at home, and bring it to his baseball games in a water jug. He also decides to copurchase comic books with his friend. He figures out that these changes will cut his sports drink and comic book spending by 50 percent.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="056" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_056_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">John is able to reduce his spending from $15 per month to $5 per month. This will increase his total savings by $60 ($10 × 6 months), leaving a remaining gap of $188 to achieve his goal.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="057" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_057_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">
			<b>
			Analysis #2: How much can John make by selling unnecessary assets?</b>  John still has to close the remaining gap of $188. So he searches his room and his basement to find items he and his family no longer need.
		</div>
		<div class="tx">He starts with his room. He finds a bunch of comic books and a brand-new dictionary that he has never used. (He prefers to use the dictionary online.) He checks out used-book websites and figures out that he can sell these books for $25.</div>
		<div class="tx">Next he heads down to the basement. Pushing aside cobwebs, he finds a golf bag his father won at a company event, a baseball glove he used to use when he was in elementary school, and a bunch of old clothes that no longer fit him. “This golf bag could sell for a lot of money!” John thinks. “I’m pretty sure my dad has another one he is already using . . . let me ask Mom if I can sell it. This baseball glove and the old clothes would fit my friend’s little brother perfectly! Let me give these to him. I think he would be really happy!”</div>
		<div class="tx">His mom tells him to go ahead. In fact, she thanks him for  cleaning out the basement. “It’s such a mess down there,” she tells him. “We have so much stuff we never use!”</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="058" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_058_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">John jumps for joy. He runs to the local sporting goods store to see how much money he can get for the golf bag. They offer him $25.</div>
		<div class="tx">So that’s $25 for the books and $25 for the golf bag. “Great!” John says. “Now I’ve closed the gap by another $50!”</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="059" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_059_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">He has $138 to go. Now he needs to find a higher-paying job to close the rest of the gap.</div>
		<div>
			 <br/></div>
		<div class="tx1">
			<b>Analysis #3: How much can John increase his income by switching jobs?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="060" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_060_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx1">John starts out by asking five of his friends about what they do for their part-time jobs and how much they get paid. Here’s what he found out:</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="061" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_061_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">Take a minute to consider these responses. What conclusions can we draw?</div>
		<div class="tx">John realizes that if you have special abilities, like web-design expertise or foreign-language skills, you can make $6 to $8 per hour. The pay seems to be less if you don’t have a specialized skill. He also notices that the $3 per hour he makes for dog walking isn’t that bad; other dog walkers are only getting paid $2 per hour.</div>
		<div class="tx">Next he visited his neighbors to find out what kind of jobs may be currently available. Here’s what they told him:</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="062" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_062_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">So should John give up, or is there a way for him to close the remaining gap? To make $138 in six months, he’ll need to increase his job income by $23 per month, which means increasing his hourly pay by almost $6.</div>
		<div class="tx">As you can see, John lives in a town with very low wages for students. No one offered him a job that pays more than the $3 per hour he already earns. John is just about ready to throw in the towel, but first he tries to come up with a creative way to increase his income without working more hours. Suddenly, he has an inspired idea.</div>
		<div class="tx">“What if I walked two more dogs simultaneously? I’ll be able to  earn $9 per hour by walking three dogs at once! I once saw somebody doing that in New York City! Great!”</div>
		<div class="tx">John asks the owners of the three dogs if it would be okay for him to walk their dogs all at once. The three are happy for John to do so, especially when they find out it’s to help him buy a computer and pursue his Hollywood dream. “You’ll have to come back when you’re famous and give us autographs,” they tell him.</div>
		<div class="tx">John has come far and now has a great plan!</div>

		<h1 class="h1"><b>THE MOST CRITICAL STEP: EXECUTION</b></h1>
		<div class="tx1">John worked all the way through the process from the beginning of this Class. He set a clear goal, figured out the gap between his goal and his current situation, formed hypotheses on how he could close that gap, and checked his hypotheses to make sure they would work. Now he has reached the most critical step: execution.</div>
		<div class="centerAligned">
			<img alt="064" class="imgepub" src="../image/wata_9781101029183_oeb_064_r1.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="tx">John now has a great plan for achieving his goal of buying a $500 Apple computer within six months, but he can’t stop here!</div>
		<div class="tx">The impact of your actions is determined by the following equation:</div>
		<div>
			 <br/></div>
		<div class="tx1">Impact=plan effectiveness x quality of execution</div>
		<div>
			 <br/></div>
		<div>
			 <br/></div>
		<div>

		<div class="tx1">To achieve the most impact, you need to have an effective plan and great execution. If you have one but not the other, you won’t be able to reach your goal. You need both.</div>

What if some of the neighbors decide they no longer need you to walk their dogs? If that happens, you no longer have to panic, because now you know how to problem solve. Just use the same approach we’ve been learning throughout this book!</div>
