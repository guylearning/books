The investor isn&#8217;t being paid, of course, since he&#8217;s only an investor. But how do I get the investor to understand that I need to be paid fairly for what I do?</SPAN></P></A>
<P class=blockquote><A id=page_14><A id=page_15>Greg: <SPAN class=cmitalic>One of the best examples is when you have what I call a money partner (the owner who provides investment capital to the business) and an effort partner (the owner who works in the business but does not have money to invest in the business). If I&#8217;m starting a business with you and I have the ability to do something but I have no cash, I need a funder to put money in. This philosophy says that 100 percent of the profits and losses of the business should be allocated to the money partner until that partner recoups the initial investment. After that, you move to some agreed profit-and-loss percentage.</SPAN></A>
