<P class=indent>After we looked at breakeven analyses, we concluded that when your pretax profit is at or below 5 percent of revenue, your business is on life support. At that point, you&#8217;ve got to do something drastic. </P>
<P class=indent>When it comes to pretax profit, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve found to be true for the vast majority of businesses:</P>
<UL class=blist>
<LI class=bl>5 percent or less of pretax profit means your business is on life support. 
<LI class=bl>10 percent of pretax profit means you have a good business. 
<LI class=bl>15 percent or more of pretax profit means you have a <SPAN class=cmitalic>great</SPAN> business.</LI></UL></SPAN>
<P class=indent>If you&#8217;re above 15 percent, you better take it while you can because the market will eventually change. The best businesses tend to operate between 10 percent and 15 percent.

When you first start a business, you&#8217;re just happy to get your salary, and then you&#8217;re happy to reach the breakeven point. Later you&#8217;re happy to have a little bit of profit. I frequently see entrepreneurs who become ecstatic over that first bit of profit. Then a nasty little realization pops into their heads: <SPAN class=cmitalic>I owe taxes on that</SPAN>. But that&#8217;s not a bad thing. Remember from chapter 1 that your number one key performance indicator is how big a check you write to the IRS.
