They are carried at their original cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is what occurs as the plant and equipment wear out little by little; every year, a charge is taken against the plant and equipment.

Companies that don&#8217;t have a long-term competitive advantage are faced with constant competition, which means they constantly have to update their manufacturing facilities to try to stay competitive, often before such equipment is worn out. This, of course, creates an ongoing expense that is often quite substantial, and keeps adding to the amount of plant and equipment the company lists on its balance sheet.

As Warren says, producing a consistent product that doesn&#8217;t have to change equates to consistent profits. The <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=93 id=page_93></SPAN>consistent product means there is no need to spend tons of money upgrading the plant and equipment just to stay competitive, which frees up tons of money for other money-making ventures. To get rich, we first have to make money, and it helps if we make lots of money. One of the ways to make lots of money is not having to spend a ton of money keeping up with the Joneses.
