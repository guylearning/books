<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>T</SPAN>otal Current Assets is a number that has long played an important role in financial analysis. Analysts have traditionally argued that subtracting a company&#8217;s current liabilities from its current assets gives them an idea whether the <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=88 id=page_88></SPAN>company can meet its short-term debt obligations. They developed the current ratio, which is derived by dividing current assets by current liabilities; the higher the ratio is, the more liquid the company. A current ratio of over one is considered good, and anything below one bad. If it is below one, it is believed that the company may have a hard time meeting its short-term obligations to its creditors.

The funny thing about a lot of companies with a durable competitive advantage is that quite often their current ratio is below the magical one. Moody&#8217;s comes in at .64, Coca-Cola at .95, Procter &amp; Gamble at .82, and Anheuser-Busch at .88. Which, from an old-school perspective, means that these companies might have difficulties paying current liabilities. What is really happening is that their earning power is so strong they can easily cover their current liabilities. Also, as a result of their tremendous earning power, these companies have no problem tapping into the cheap, short-term commercial paper market if they need any additional short-term cash.

Because of their great earning power, they can also pay out generous dividends and make stock repurchases, both of which diminish cash reserves and help pull their current ratios below one. But it is the consistency of their earning power, which comes with having a durable competitive advantage, that ensures they can cover their current liabilities and not fall prey to the vicissitudes of business cycles and recessions.

In short, there are many companies with a durable competitive advantage that have current ratios less than one. Such companies create an anomaly that renders the current ratio almost useless in helping us identify whether or not a company has a durable competitive advantage.
