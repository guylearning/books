Maybe you had a big month and you want to reward yourself with a trip or a convertible. But before you spend money on anything, you have to set the taxes aside. This is one of the most important things I tell my clients who are on a cash-basis accounting system.

Whenever possible, I recommend cash-basis accounting because there&#8217;s a much tighter correlation between the cash in your hands and paying taxes on that cash. There are a few rare circumstances when it&#8217;s better to be on the accrual system, such as a business that gets paid up front for something. But that doesn&#8217;t happen very often. Even if your customers pay you up front, if your accounts receivable are usually larger than your accounts payable, then you should be on a cash basis. The only time you want to be on an accrual system is if your accounts receivable are consistently lower than your accounts payable. An interesting thing to note about C corporations is they have a requirement to become accrual based at some point. Conversely, S corporations and LLCs can remain on a cash basis no matter how large they get. However, if you have inventory, you are generally required to be on an accrual basis, no matter what type of legal entity you are.

In most cases, this is my philosophy: <SPAN class=cmitalic>Don&#8217;t pay taxes until you absolutely have to without incurring a penalty</SPAN>. Until you pay the taxes, you have to set the money aside and get it out of your financial calculations so you know it isn&#8217;t yours to spend.
