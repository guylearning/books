<A id=page_27>The need to add management infrastructure seems to naturally occur when you have about twenty employees typically, when you&#8217;re between $2 million and $3.5 million in revenue. Before then, you can get away with not having management structures and moving people from a production role to a management <A id=page_28>role. But when you have about twenty employees, you have to create a different management structure.</A>

<P class=indent>It&#8217;s really expensive to hire the wrong people and then replace them. The more times you have to repeat that hiring cycle, the more expensive and more damaging it becomes. The real cost varies, depending on the situation. The usual scenario is that you add labor cost, and the added labor does not increase revenue. Thus, the cost of the additional labor causes an equal drop in net income. Your existing staff see this impact (whether you share numbers or not) and become afraid that they may be let go as the company struggles. Your most capable employees sense this and leave for better opportunities, leaving you with the least productive people. Your lost profit from your hiring mistake leaves you with no excess capital or borrowing capacity to hire a replacement. So you retrench and you assume the role you tried to hire for. You push to stabilize the company so you can make another hiring attempt as soon as you can.
