<P>This article describes the fastest avenue towards rock-solid lifetime knowledge: <B>Incremental Learning</B>. </P>
<P>Incremental learning is the fastest and the most comprehensive way of learning available to students at the moment of writing (2013). </P>
<P>Incremental learning is a consolidation of computer-based techniques that accelerate and optimize the process of learning from all conceivable material available in electronic form, and not only. </P>
<P>Currently, <A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memo.com/supermemo17.html">SuperMemo</A> is the only software that implements incremental learning. In SuperMemo, the student feeds the program with all forms of learning material and/or data (texts, pictures, videos, sounds, etc.). Those learning materials are then gradually converted into durable knowledge that can last a lifetime. </P>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<P><B>Incremental learning helps the student convert all forms of learning material into durable and lasting memories.</B> </P></DIV>
<P>In incremental learning, the student usually remembers 95% of his or her top priority material. That knowledge is relatively stable and lasts in student's memory as long as the process continues, and well beyond. </P>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<P><B>Incremental learning easily ensures 95% recall of top-priority learning material for lifetime</B> (as long as the student ensures a regular review along the prescription provided by the program). </P></DIV>
<P>The cost of high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="0" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention">knowledge retention</A> is very small when compared with various traditional learning methods. For example, in learning a language, the <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/english/ae.htm">vocabulary of an educated native speaker</A> can be retained in SuperMemo at the cost of 20 minutes per day in the first years of the process, and mere minutes in later years (assuming the original set is acquired in portions spread over 4 years in 30-50 min. sessions). </P>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<P><B>Incremental learning ensures high recall at a fraction of the cost in time (as compared to textbook learning).</B> </P></DIV>
<P>The incremental learning derives its name from the incremental nature of the learning process. In incremental learning, all facets of knowledge receive a regular treatment, and there is a regular inflow of new knowledge that builds upon the past knowledge. In incremental learning, the student sits in the driving seat and determines which knowledge should be mastered. He or she determines when this happens, with what degree of detail, at what <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority">priority</A>, and at what desired degree of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="2" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention">recall/retention</A>. For example, in a single session, the student may learn a few facts of geography, discover a few rules of healthy lifestyle, figure out a few statistical formulas, read a couple of paragraphs from a friend's blog, process a few minutes of his home video collection, annotate a few family pictures, watch a few pieces from his YouTube video collection, and read a few articles in subjects related to a forthcoming exam. In other words, all areas of knowledge keep growing in parallel in proportion to interests and importance. </P>
<P>Typical learning at school puts an emphasis on a few areas of knowledge and neglects all the remaining areas. A medical student may spend a few months mastering anatomy, while gradually forgetting his biochemistry material in the meantime (or the other way round). At the same time, he or she will not find time to study important issues of the day that will always depend on a given person in a given context. With blinkers imposed by the heavy load of school material, the student may never find time, for example, to figure out what incremental learning is. Narrow horizons and narrow perspectives only make it harder to further rationalize the selection of the learning material. </P>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<P><B>Incremental learning is the opposite of the irrational school system learning in which a heavy focus is put on just a few areas of knowledge in a semester (at the cost of other, equally important, areas of learning).</B> </P></DIV>

<H2><SPAN id=The_value_of_interruption_in_learning class=mw-headline>The value of interruption in learning</SPAN></H2>
<P>In incremental learning, we often quickly move from one subject to another. Such interruptions may occur many times during a single learning day. When people first learn about this incremental methodology they immediately ask <I>"Why interrupt? Aren't these the prime principles of human endeavour to be thorough, persist, and do things right to the end?"</I> </P>
<P>The 3 main advantages of interruption in learning are: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>improving memory</B>: spaced learning has long been proven dramatically more efficient than conglomerate learning massed in time 
<LI><B>improving learning choices/priorities</B>: unless the learning material has been pre-selected by a higher authority, student's own choices require prioritization, which in turn requires preview. Previewing is a form of interruption. Regular interruption allows of prioritizing on the go 
<LI><B>improving attention</B>: whenever attention declines, change of the subject is the simplest remedy other than taking a definite break from learning</LI></UL>
<P>As for the disadvantages ... there are none! Simply put: <B>interruption is optional!</B> It is true that incremental learning may lead to "learning impatience" and "craving interruption", however, these have never been proven detrimental beyond showing that once you employ incremental learning, you may never want to go back to traditional "book at a time" learning. Nevertheless, you should not forget that schools are incremental too. Just on a slightly moderate scale. Schools employ interruption when kids move from geography to physics, or when they close the books for the day. </P>
<P>Once the art of incremental learning is mastered, the advantages go far beyond the advantages of the interruption or <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" data-hasqtip="5" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</A>. Here is a shortlist (for a detailed discussion see: <A href="#Advantages_of_incremental_reading">Advantages of incremental learning</A>). </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>massive learning</B> - you learn more than you thought your memory can hold 
<LI><B>95% knowledge retention</B> - you nearly eliminate the problem of forgetting 
<LI><B>lifetime memories</B> - your memories will last for life (as long as you stick with the regular review schedule based on <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" data-hasqtip="6" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</A>) 
<LI><B>comprehensive learning</B> on all fronts (rather than the school-like focus on 2-4 majors) 
<LI><B>better understanding</B> of the studied subject is assisted by moderation in consuming details, and easy inclusion of explanatory material (e.g. from dictionaries and/or encyclopedias) 
<LI><B>better consolidation of the knowledge structure</B> by incremental approach, interrupted learning, spacing, and slotting in of the new knowledge. Contrary to popular belief, incremental learning helps you keep the big picture in your mind 
<LI><B>better attention</B> by focusing on a single issue at a time without ever missing a detail, and by remedying attention deficits with a constant change of the learning material 
<LI><B>creativity</B> - by encountering different subjects in unpredictable sequences, your creativity soars. You can employ it, for example, in the process of <A href="#Incremental_problem_solving">incremental problem solving</A> or <A href="#Incremental_writing">incremental writing</A> (this article was written using incremental writing tools in SuperMemo) 
<LI><B>battling chaos</B> - it is easier to resolve contradictions in SuperMemo, e.g. when processing new research with contradictory claims and findings. Unlike your memory in "real life" where you keep oscillating between contradictions, SuperMemo does not tolerate information discrepancy. Contradictory material converges up to a point when you realize you need to decide on the nature of the truth 
<LI><B>all knowledge is well prioritized</B> 
<LI><B>all knowledge is easily searchable</B> 
<LI><B>all knowledge is quantifiable</B> (size, retention, workload, etc.) 
<LI><B>stresslessness</B> - nothing frees your mind for learning efficiently as the sense that no detail will ever be missed and you can focus on a single problem at a time while delegating other problems to later 
<LI><B>fun</B> - once you master incremental learning, it can truly be the best part of your day with few other earthly pleasures giving you as much satisfaction as new useful knowledge</LI></UL>
<P>In short, with incremental learning you learn fast, you acquire massive loads of knowledge, retain memories for life, remember almost all that you have learned, understand things better, develop harmoniously in all directions, enhance your creativity, and all that while having incredible fun! If that sounds too good to be true, please read more below or just give it a solid try.

<H2><SPAN id=Interruption_is_not_a_problem class=mw-headline>Interruption is not a problem</SPAN></H2>
<P>In learning, choosing the right learning sources is the first step to success. A well-written article will get you to the basic idea from its first paragraph or even a sentence. Incremental reading is best suited for articles written in hypertext or in an encyclopedic manner. Ideally, each sentence you read has a contribution to your knowledge and is not useless without the sentences that follow. </P>
<P>Imagine that you would like to learn a few things about <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</A>. You will, for example, import to SuperMemo an article about Nasser from <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>. In the first sentence you will find out that "<I>Gamal Abdel Nasser (1918 - 1970) was the second President of Egypt</I>". If you are new to Nasser, you may be happy to just know he was the Egyptian president and safely jump to reading other articles. Thus you may delay the encounter with the historic role of Nasser and economize some time to finding out, for example, who <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres">Shimon Peres</A> is. When you see the Nasser article for the second time, you might find that "<I>He was followed by after President Muhammad Naguib and can be considered one of the most important Arab leaders in history</I>". This piece of knowledge is also self-contained and you can patiently wait for your third encounter with Nasser. When you return the next time, you may conclude that another piece about Nasser is of lower priority: "<I>Nasser was born in Alexandria</I>". You can schedule the review of that piece in 2-3 years. Perhaps your interest in Nasser or in <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria">Alexandria</A> will grow to the point that this knowledge will become relevant. If not, you can always <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Dismiss" data-hasqtip="7" oldtitle="Glossary:Dismiss">dismiss</A> or delete such an <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="8" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extract</A>. Alternatively, you can skip a few paragraphs and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="9" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extract</A> a more important sentence: "<I>In 1952, Nasser led the military coup against King Farouk I of Egypt</I>". Even if your read individual sentences about Nasser in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="10" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval">intervals</A> lasting months, your knowledge will progressively expand and will become increasingly consolidated (esp. if you employ <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="11" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletions</A>, which are mandatory for longer <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="12" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval">intervals</A>). </P>
<P>Naturally, not all texts are are so well-suited for incremental reading. For example, a research paper may throw at you a detailed description of methods and leave results and conclusions for the end. In such cases, you may <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="13" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extract</A> the abstract and delay the body of the paper by a period in which you believe the abstract will have been sufficiently processed. Then, if you are still interested in the article, you can schedule the methods well into the future (you will or will not read the methods depending on the conclusions of the article). You can schedule the results and the discussion into a less remote point in time, and proceed with reading the conclusions. </P>
<P>The hardest texts may not be suitable to reading in increments. For example, a piece of software code may need to be analyzed in its entirety before it reveals any useful meaning. In such cases, when the text (here the code) comes up in the incremental reading process, analyze it and verbalize your conclusions. The conclusions can then be processed incrementally. You will generate individual questions depending on which pieces of knowledge you consider important and which become volatile. The original computer code can be still retained in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="14" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A> as reference only. </P>
<P>When learning at the university, you do many courses in parallel. That's a macro version of incremental reading. Many people love to zap TV channels and play a chaotic version of <A title="Incremental video" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_video">incremental video</A> with their TV set. Zapping may not be a recommended way of learning, but it won't leave your mind blank. Another example can be seen in people who have a habit of reading a few novels in parallel. Their limit on the number of novels comes from the limits of human memory. There is a breaking point beyond which a novel, if read in bursts separated by longer <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="15" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval">intervals</A>, cannot be followed due to fading memories. Incremental reading is based on <A title=SuperMemo href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo">SuperMemo</A>, and by definition is far less limited by your forgetful memory. The number of articles in the process can reach a hundred thousands, and given basic skills, you won't get confused.

<P>Unlike classic SuperMemo, incremental learning requires quite a lot of experience and training before it becomes effective. However, your investment will be returned manifold once you become proficient with the method. </P>
<P>Incremental learning is a consolidation of technologies that have been in development for nearly 3 decades. It is still in the process of maturing and it is still pretty complex. It requires skills that take months to develop. It requires your own strategies that may mature over years. Moreover, incremental learning requires the mastery of SuperMemo, which has been optimized for professional use. As such it is not beginner friendly. </P>
<P>Users complain that SuperMemo has a steep learning curve. They are right. SuperMemo has been optimized to make a life of a pro easy. It makes life of beginners hard because it does not ever compromise the learning efficiency for sleekness or marketing value. Take the <A href="#Priority_queue">priority queue</A> as an example. Nearly everyone asks why the articles of highest value have a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="16">priority</A> of 0% rather than the obvious 100%. They ask: <I>"Why is SuperMemo always keeping things upside down?"</I>. They got a point. However, no pro user would ever swap the ease of typing 1, 2, 3 for his top priority material as opposed to 99, 98 or 97. Those dilemmas slow down the adoption of SuperMemo. However, once you become a pro, you will appreciate this approach and will more likely become a lifelong devotee.
