Welcome to what I refer to as the <SPAN class=cmitalic>salary economy</SPAN>. I call it this because the market affects the way you manage your salary cap whether you want it to or not. Understanding these market forces helps you effectively manage the salaries in your business. Some people believe they can take a minimalist approach and pay people the least amount possible. In this chapter, you&#8217;ll learn that there&#8217;s a middle ground between paying too much and paying too little. It&#8217;s important to understand these concepts because your gross profit per labor dollar is the second most important key performance indicator for your business (remember that the size of the check you wrote to the IRS is number one).

<strong><font color="blue">6. How to Maximize Your Labor Productivity : </font></strong><H3><SPAN class=cmbold>PRODUCTIVITY FROM EVERY DOLLAR OF LABOR SPENT</SPAN></H3></A>
<P class=noindent><A id=page_81>In chapter 3 I said the number one thing that causes you to be either profitable or unprofitable is how much productivity you get out of every dollar you spend on labor, including your own market-based wage. I&#8217;ll use my company as an example. I have to get $1.80 of gross profit (revenue less direct out-of-pocket costs for subcontractors or travel, not including any in-house labor) for every $1.00 I spend on labor to reach <A id=page_82>my profitability target, regardless of whether that $1.00 is paid to an administrative person or a production person. You might think administrative people don&#8217;t generate gross profit, but they do! They take care of tasks that allow billable people to be more billable.</A></P><A id=page_82>
<P class=indent>In every business, each dollar spent on labor has to show a demonstrable output for gross profit. Here&#8217;s a simple metric to keep in mind: If you aren&#8217;t at 10 percent pretax profit, use what you learned about managing and raising your salary cap in chapter 3 to determine how much labor you need to cut or how much gross profit you need to add to get to that number, and then try not to add staff until you get to 15 percent pretax profit. This is how you control internal growth and profitability.</P>
<P class=indent>What people often do is add five people at once. You typically can&#8217;t absorb that cost. It&#8217;s like taking five daily vitamins in a single day. Your body can&#8217;t absorb it. It&#8217;s more efficient to hire people on a more regular cycle and give them more direct attention.</P>

CAN CULTURE AND PROFITABILITY COEXIST?</SPAN></H3>
<P class=noindent>Every business has a culture, and it&#8217;s an important part of the foundation of your business. Your challenge is to find a way for your culture and profitability to play nice with each other. I have seen it succeed in my company and in my clients&#8217; companies. I have also seen companies fail when they overemphasized one over the other. It&#8217;s a good idea to document your culture and how it ties into your profitability as a business because the more you document it, the easier it is to live it and maintain it.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_82>You can take a look at my firm&#8217;s culture document on our website, <A href="http://www.seeingbeyondnumbers.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>www.seeingbeyondnumbers.com</FONT></A>. You can use it as a template and adjust the wording to fit your needs. It basically states what our plans are, who we are, why we believe certain things, and how we hold people accountable. My COO sends an e-mail at the beginning of the week that highlights one segment of our culture document to let everyone know what our focus of the week is.</P>
<P class=indent>One of the advantages of having a culture document is to avoid the <A id=page_83>&#8220;emperor has no clothes&#8221; scenario that every entrepreneur faces. One way I avoid this is by encouraging a long-term employee to be brutally honest with me. I tell her to let me know if I&#8217;m ever just out in left field and not really paying attention to what is going on. If there&#8217;s someone in the business who can be a knowledgeable sounding board and has a high comfort level with you, encourage that person to come to you and tell you the hard things. This has to be someone who will say, &#8220;That sounds great, but that&#8217;s not going to happen because here&#8217;s how you&#8217;re coming across to everybody else.&#8221;</A></P><A id=page_83>
<P class=indent>Owners commonly want to have a family atmosphere. This is admirable, but understand that a company with a great culture and no profits is going to die. You have to make sure your culture doesn&#8217;t excuse people from getting their jobs done. There&#8217;s an economic relationship between productivity and the amount you&#8217;re paying people to get things done. If this relationship isn&#8217;t balanced, you have a flawed business model.</P>

THE SALARY ECONOMY</SPAN></H3>
<P class=noindent>This is where the salary economy comes in. Essentially, your goal is to avoid overpaying or underpaying your employees. Both situations are bad, but the entrepreneurs who underpay employees tend to have companies that struggle in the long run due to high employee turnover. Companies in the same industry that pay higher wages and have fewer employees might be more profitable than companies that pay lower wages and have more employees, but it&#8217;s a very delicate balance. You can&#8217;t assume that if you pay higher wages you&#8217;ll get more productivity, and you can&#8217;t assume that if you pay lower wages you&#8217;ll get the same productivity.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_83>Never give an employee a cost-of-living adjustment. If you do, you will have many employees asking for a salary increase based on what they need to make a living. The amount they choose to spend in their lives is not your problem. What you pay them should be within a market-based range for their roles. My approach to this frequently raises questions in the entrepreneur classes I teach. Participants want to know if I look at <A id=page_84>cost-of-living adjustments differently if a period of severe, long inflation affects my own business. What they really want to know is whether the cost of living drives the salary economy or if the salary economy drives the cost of living. I believe the salary economy drives the cost of living. Salary is like a gas; it expands into the chamber of life and you consume it, for the most part, so you adapt based on whatever salary is available to you.</A></P><A id=page_84>

HOW MARKET FORCES IMPACT SALARIES</SPAN></H3>
<P class=noindent>I have a lot of clients who overpay people. This is often a classic example of having an employee who claims to have fifteen years of experience but actually only has <SPAN class=cmitalic>one year of experience fifteen times</SPAN>. This kind of employee is worth no more than an employee who has one year of experience, so years of experience often don&#8217;t count for much. The important thing is what people know and if they have the capacity to produce. Some people think it&#8217;s great to be with a company twenty years, but there are plenty of people who&#8217;ve worked in the same job for twenty years and just showed up for work and did the same thing every day. In this case, a fresh person with no experience can easily do that job.</P>
<P class=indent>Eventually, market forces flush out both sides of the equation. Let&#8217;s say you have a person who&#8217;s outperforming a higher-paid employee. You have two choices. If the higher-paid employee represents the true market value, you have to raise the lower-paid employee to that salary level. If the higher-paid employee isn&#8217;t worth the money, you have to either transition that employee out of the business or find a way to improve that employee&#8217;s performance. In rare cases, I have lowered the pay of the underperformer, but that is usually a short-term fix until that person chooses to leave.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_84>Employees often end up being underpaid because they came into the company at entry-level positions. Even though you inch their pay up every year, you suddenly realize you&#8217;re adding new people who are making the same amount as employees who came into the business two <A id=page_85>years earlier. Now you have employees who have been there for two years and are making an entry-level wage. You must decide if those people are underpaid and worthy of a higher salary.</A></P><A id=page_85>
<P class=indent>During the five years from 2005 to 2010, I saw both ends of the spectrum in terms of available employment. When the unemployment rate was below 5 percent, employers had to overpay to attract desirable employees. However, since 2008 a lot of experienced people have become increasingly desperate. Someone who&#8217;s used to making $75,000 to $100,000 might be willing to accept $40,000 to $60,000 just to get a foot in the door. In a downturn, certain industries collapse, and they aren&#8217;t going to come back anytime soon. The people from those industries will take serious wage cuts because they have to start at the beginning and learn a new industry. Be careful about hiring people for $40,000 a year when they&#8217;re used to making $80,000 a year. You need to have a career path that gets them back up to $80,000, because when their original industry bounces back, they&#8217;ll leave you to get their $80,000 job back. You often have to consider these transitional people to be short-term employees.</P>

USING SALARY SURVEYS</SPAN></H3>
<P class=noindent>So how do you make sure you pick the wage that&#8217;s in line with the market? In chapter 1 I talked about using salary surveys to determine market-based wages, but remember that they can be inflated. You can also gauge market value by talking to your peers in the same industry and looking at local wage surveys. My local chamber of commerce publishes an excellent wage survey each year. We participate and have access to the survey. It&#8217;s been a very valuable source of information. Association wage surveys are probably valid only for your employees because, as we&#8217;ve discussed, owners play games with their salaries and distributions.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_85>Despite their shortcomings, salary surveys can help you define salary ranges. My firm has administrative positions, entry-level accounting positions, client manager positions, and specialist positions. Salary <A id=page_86>ranges are established for each position, and they take into account the required skill sets and education. For production positions, we look at the productivity needed based on the revenue and gross profit requirements. Not every business can tie profitability or gross profit or revenue on a per-employee basis, but many can. If you have that ability and there&#8217;s software that allows you to capture the data, it&#8217;s one of the best ways to understand and evaluate employees.</A></P><A id=page_86>
<P class=indent>Be aware that when you have this kind of data, you can end up with a moral dilemma. Let&#8217;s say you have an employee who is producing significantly more than another employee, but they have similar salaries. You have to honestly look at the data and decide if you&#8217;re going to pay the more productive person a higher salary or pay the other person less.</P>

EVALUATION PROCESS IS KEY</SPAN></H3>
<P class=noindent>Your employees need to understand what is expected of them in terms of productivity, and the best way to accomplish this is through the employee review process. Although you need to deal with issues as they come up, you need to have a formal meeting with each employee at least twice a year.</P>
<P class=indent>I focus on career planning and career path in employee reviews. Realistically, my goal is to invest in my employees&#8217; careers for as long as they want to be at my firm. We discuss their career goals and answer a few questions. Do they require additional education? Do they need different skill sets to get promoted to a higher level? The more closely you define and help develop an individual&#8217;s career, the more likely you are going to have a long-term employee. Even if an employee&#8217;s desire goes beyond working at my company, it&#8217;s still in my best interest to help the employee develop so that person can have a successful career. As long as the employee works for me and I&#8217;m getting productivity for the money I&#8217;m paying in salaries, that&#8217;s a good thing. I want my employees to understand that they are welcome to work in my company as long as we are both getting a fair exchange.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_86><A id=page_87>It&#8217;s my responsibility as the CEO of the company to provide my employees with a vibrant environment, a fair wage, and a good culture. When there&#8217;s a point where it doesn&#8217;t work anymore, I&#8217;ll help an employee transition into a new job. For the most part, I&#8217;ve taken a hard view that says we&#8217;re all replaceable&#8212;including me! But if we try to help each other become the best we can be, it leads to a much better cultural experience for everybody. You&#8217;ll even find that some people stay far longer than they otherwise would have.</A></P><A id=page_87>
<H4>Identify the Top Three to Five Skill Sets for Each Role</H4></A>
<P class=noindent><A id=page_87>A lot of business owners get too detailed when they evaluate what matters in each job. Focus on the top three to five skill sets that are required to maximize productivity for each job. You can easily list twenty to thirty skill sets that you really want a person to have, but in terms of evaluating whether those skill sets match that person&#8217;s compensation and productivity, it&#8217;s going to come down to three to five that matter the most. For your sales department, you might list effective use of <A href="http://www.salesforce.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>Salesforce.com</FONT></A>, proposal drafting, and lead generation. For your receptionist, you might list phone etiquette, document management, and proposal editing and production. As you do your performance reviews with these skill sets in mind, you will be able to give more specific direction on how employees can improve their performance and how you can help them achieve their productivity potential.</P>
<P class=indent>At my firm, we identified five skill sets for our technical people. The first three are being able to project and prepare personal tax returns, project and prepare business tax returns, and set up and run a set of books. A lot of accountants believe bookkeeping is beneath them, but many times when I&#8217;m discussing problems with clients I need to tell them how to fix something in QuickBooks. The fourth skill set is the ability to prepare a reviewed financial statement, which looks exactly like an audit, but the opinion letter is different and the underlying work is different. The fifth skill set is the ability to create an integrated <A id=page_88>balance sheet, profit and loss and cash flow forecast from a blank Excel spreadsheet. We take historical data from our clients and create a forecast called a <SPAN class=cmitalic>momentum forecast</SPAN> that is based on the movement of real data rather than input from the client.</A></P><A id=page_88>
<H4>Employee Evaluations That Will Drive Culture and Profitability</H4>
<P class=noindent>Now that you have identified the required core skill sets, let&#8217;s discuss the five critical areas I use to evaluate each employee. These areas are in order of importance to us and allow us to keep true to our culture and drive profitability.</P>
<H5>Key #1: How Good a Teammate Is the Employee?</H5>
<P class=noindent>Our front-desk person is the quarterback of the office. Just about every business has someone like that. Her customers are both external customers who walk in the door and every other person she supports inside the business. If she is cold toward either external customers or her fellow teammates, it doesn&#8217;t matter how good her skill sets are. Every employee (and the owner!) has to be a good teammate to fit into our culture and represent the firm well.</P>
<H5>Key #2: How Well Does the Employee Connect with External Customers?</H5>
<P class=noindent>There are a lot of people who are technically sound but don&#8217;t do well with people. Maybe you think you can hide these people in a corner and hope they don&#8217;t have to talk to customers, but at some point they&#8217;ll likely have contact with a customer. Do you want those people to represent your business?</P>
<H5>Key #3: How Productive Is the Employee?</H5></A>
<P class=noindent><A id=page_88>I have found that there are two types of workers: tortoises and hares. Tortoises stay at their desks. They stay focused and they work, work, <A id=page_89>work. They may not necessarily be fast, but they stay at it. Hares can whip out tasks, but they spend the next hour telling <SPAN class=cmitalic>everyone</SPAN> how fast they got it done. The problem is they can&#8217;t maintain that pace; they get burned out and need a lot of time to recharge. So be careful in terms of evaluating productivity over short periods of time versus longer periods of time.</A></P><A id=page_89>
<P class=indent>Watch for employees who have to expend a large number of hours to be productive. There are times when you need people to put in extra hours, but it should be because you need the additional productivity. You don&#8217;t need people to work extra hours if they were unproductive for a couple of hours that day. Beware of employees who come in an hour late and then stay late to make up time or employees who take extra breaks and extra time at lunch to surf the Web or make personal phone calls. You can use timesheets to find out people&#8217;s true productivity. Timesheets don&#8217;t lie, but sometimes it&#8217;s very painful to recognize what&#8217;s going on.</P>
<H5>Key #4: Does the Employee Contribute at Your Targeted Profitability Levels?</H5>
<P class=noindent>Clearly you have to make a profit from every employee or else you have a broken business model, so you have to evaluate each employee in terms of profitability. Even if you don&#8217;t have a gross profit component to compare against an employee&#8217;s performance, you can still look at profitability. If you have a person who&#8217;s making $50,000 a year, look at the things that person does. If you can hire somebody for $35,000 a year to do the same thing, then you&#8217;re losing $15,000 a year.</P>
<P class=indent>It&#8217;s not uncommon for someone who&#8217;s doing a $35,000-a-year job to creep up to $50,000 a year. This is especially true when a job initially required technical experience, but maybe the technology is more common now and anyone can be taught those skills. That&#8217;s a tough one in terms of salary cap management, but it gives you a basis of communication with that employee, which leads you back to career development.</P></A>
<H5><A id=page_89><A id=page_90>Key #5: Core Competencies: Have the Employee&#8217;s Responsibilities and Skills Increased?</A></H5><A id=page_90>
<P class=noindent>When people have stepped up and taken their performance to another pay level, I adjust their salaries as soon as I can. I spent three years as a controller for a bank, and in that period there were three specific times when my roles and responsibilities changed. Each time the CEO of the bank gave me a pay adjustment. I try to follow this example and not wait for a review cycle to adjust someone&#8217;s pay.</P>
<P class=indent>I tell my staff that their pay changes for only one of two reasons: if the salary economy changed and we adjusted the pay scale or if they moved up a level. When the latter happens, I say something like, &#8220;You&#8217;ve moved from level two to level three to become a client manager.&#8221; The employee knows that the pay scale moves up by a certain amount. I make it clear what the person will do differently as a level-three client manager, and I explain what the employee needs to improve on to get to level four. By doing this, I can give people definitive guidance and provide a focus to their career paths.</P>

<P class=indent><A id=page_90>My firm practices a version of OBM in which we share <SPAN class=cmitalic>all</SPAN> the information. Everyone knows what everyone else makes. My staff know what I make, they know what the firm&#8217;s numbers are, and they have access to the firm&#8217;s financial data. I want them to understand the part they play in our success. I&#8217;d rather deal with facts than rumors. I can explain any financial decision I make, but if I&#8217;m inconsistent with any decision, I&#8217;m held accountable for it. The challenge is that some <A id=page_91>employees are a little uncomfortable with this approach. My response is that they&#8217;ll become more comfortable as they start to understand that they&#8217;re being paid a fair wage for what they produce. That&#8217;s an essential part of our culture.</A></P><A id=page_91>
<P class=indent>When employees ask why someone else is making more than they are, it&#8217;s an opportunity to talk with them about how they can make more money. I show them what their productivity needs to be to get to the next salary level. I&#8217;m not running a charity&#8212;my business runs under the same laws of business physics as everyone else&#8217;s&#8212;but I have to be able to talk through the perceived inequities.</P>
<P class=indent>Some business owners are concerned about sharing numbers because when employees leave for a different job, they might share the numbers with a competitor. My viewpoint is that my numbers don&#8217;t really matter. It&#8217;s more important to me that my fellow practitioners do the things we do so they can help more clients run profitable businesses. The market is huge; the number of competitors isn&#8217;t one of my challenges. My biggest challenge is how quickly I can grow college students into client managers so I can expand my business.</P>
<P class=indent>Many business owners practice OBM with the exception of sharing salary information. I struggle with that approach because, as I said at the beginning of the chapter, your gross profit per labor dollar is the second most important key performance indicator for your business. If you and your management team are not comfortable explaining the numbers, I would not recommend using OBM. However, if you can become confident in explaining your data to your team, I think you will find OBM very liberating.</P>

BE CAREFUL WITH INCENTIVE PLANS</SPAN></H3></A>
<P class=noindent><A id=page_91>Contrary to popular opinion, throwing money at a problem doesn&#8217;t change the outcome. Most entrepreneurs look to incentive plans as a substitute for management and leadership. I urge my clients to not make this mistake and encourage them to evaluate their management and <A id=page_92>leadership skills and make improvements where needed before any incentive plan is implemented.</A></P><A id=page_92>
<P class=indent>I&#8217;ve played with incentive plans, and very few of them created the desired outcomes. Before I devise an incentive plan for an employee, I want to see a personality profile to find out if the person is motivated by money and driven by incentive plans. Very few people are motivated this way. People will tell you that getting more money will change their performance, but it&#8217;s usually more effective to use small amounts of money along the way to recognize outstanding achievement.</P>
<H4>Executive Incentive Plans</H4></A>
<P class=noindent><A id=page_92>As you get larger, you may have to implement an executive incentive plan to stay competitive with your market. You can go to my company&#8217;s website, <A href="http://www.seeingbeyondnumbers.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>www.seeingbeyondnumbers.com</FONT></A>, and see an example of a plan for executive team members where we tie in two components. The first component is a gross profit dollar scale that shows what executives can earn and what the business performance needs to be in terms of gross profit. This has various levels: a minimal acceptable performance, a target performance, and a stretch performance. In some cases, there can even be a level beyond stretch performance.</P>
<P class=indent>The second component is the labor efficiency ratio I mentioned earlier, which may range from $1.80 to $2.20 of gross profit for every $1.00 the company spends on labor. If a company hits its gross profit dollar performance level and the labor efficiency ratio, profitability is almost assured to hit the bottom line. But if the company hits only the gross profit performance and overspends on labor to make it, the profit target is not reached, and the executive bonus is reduced or even eliminated.</P>
<H4>Forecast Your Incentive Payments</H4>
<P class=noindent>I use a miniature business forecast for each component of my incentive plan models. If the business hits a certain level of gross profit performance and a certain level of labor efficiency, I know what the pretax <A id=page_93>profit will be before incentives. I can also see what the total incentives will be so I&#8217;ll know what percentage of profitability will be going to an employee.</A></P><A id=page_93>
<P class=indent>So many times people just pick numbers out of the air and say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you 1 percent of revenue or 10 percent of profit.&#8221; They don&#8217;t go through the mathematical implications of what they are giving away. In many cases, every dime of additional growth benefits an employee who may not have caused it. You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s taking the risk of running the business, so unless you forecast incentive payments, you could be throwing good money after bad. Pick whatever number makes sense after you forecast it and understand the financial implications.</P>
<H4>Payout Plans</H4>
<P class=noindent>The other part of an incentive plan is how you pay it out. In Jack Stack&#8217;s <SPAN class=cmitalic>The Great Game of Business</SPAN> he describes a 10, 20, 30, 40 percent methodology he used to avoid overpaying incentives early in the year:</P></A>
<OL class=olist><A id=page_93>
<LI class=nl>In the first quarter, calculate the annual bonus by annualizing the first quarter&#8217;s productivity. The employee would be paid 10 percent of the annualized bonus. 
<LI class=nl>In the second quarter, take six months of performance, annualize it, and then calculate 30 percent of the annual bonus. Subtract the 10 percent you paid in the first quarter, and pay the employee the other 20 percent. At this point, the employee has been paid a total of 30 percent. 
<LI class=nl>In the third quarter, take nine months of performance, annualize it, and then calculate 60 percent of the annual bonus. Subtract what was paid already in the first and second quarter, and then pay out the balance. It&#8217;s self-correcting each quarter. The employee is always getting what&#8217;s due today minus what&#8217;s previously paid.</A> 
<LI class=nl><A id=page_93><A id=page_94>In the fourth quarter, the bonus is 100 percent of the annual bonus less what has been previously paid in the first three quarters. By leaving the largest payout until the end of the year, some businesses can still make up for poor performance earlier in the year with a Hail Mary approach.</A><A id=page_94></A></LI></OL><A id=page_94>
<P class=indent>This kind of incentive plan is based on annual performance, but some businesses base incentives on quarterly or monthly performance, especially when they have a poor history of putting four solid quarters of performance together. The problem with these plans is that they encourage people to play games at the end of the month, such as pulling sales into the end of the month or pushing them forward.</P>
<H4>Have a Fallback Plan</H4>
<P class=noindent>In <SPAN class=cmitalic>The Great Game of Business</SPAN>, Jack Stack looks at smaller incentive plans that were adapted to meet current market challenges. If you adapt a plan to consider the market, you need to have a fallback option in case the market forces make it impossible for employees to meet the incentives. My fallback plan is to use discretionary judgment on what the target incentives should be for people who went above and beyond the call of duty but just didn&#8217;t get results. Obviously, I can&#8217;t give out incentives that my business can&#8217;t afford. If the market prevented the employee from hitting the target, I have to use my judgment to determine what the payout should be. If the employee just didn&#8217;t deliver, I have to allow the failure and decide if it&#8217;s a one-time thing or if the employee needs to be transitioned into a new role or maybe even out of the company.
