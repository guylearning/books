Assets are mainly shown in the accounts at their cost (or unexpired cost). Therefore the &#8216;Assets&#8217; column is a list of items of value at their present cost to the company. It can be looked on as a list of items of continuing value on which money has been used or spent. 
<P></P>
<P>The &#8216;Liabilities&#8217; column simply lists the various sources of this same sum of money.</P>
<P>All cash brought into the business is a source of funds, while all cash paid out is a use of funds. A balance sheet can, therefore, be looked on from this angle &#8211; as a statement of sources and uses of funds (see <A title="Figure&nbsp;2.3.&nbsp;The balance sheet &#8211; sources and uses of funds approach" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch02.html#ch02fig03"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 2.3</FONT></A>).
