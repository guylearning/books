<strong><font color="blue">5. Taming the Tax Monster Under Your Bed: Tax Management That Works : </font></strong><H3><SPAN class=cmbold>CHEATERS NEVER PROSPER</SPAN></H3>
<P class=noindent>I wish it weren&#8217;t true, but based on my own interactions with people and my discussions with entrepreneurs, I think cheating is more widespread than even the IRS estimates. Since cheating comes in many different forms, the question is whether the cheating is just a little thing or if it translates into big dollars that you should pay to the IRS. If you&#8217;re doing things that aren&#8217;t right, you&#8217;re cheating. But a lot of people try to justify the dubious decisions they make.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_69>One of the ways people soothe their conscience about cheating is by collecting cocktail advice. They think, &#8220;Well, I talked to Fred at the party last night and he takes this deduction, and if Fred takes it, then it must be okay.&#8221; To be clear, I&#8217;m not talking about the issues that have an <A id=page_70>element of grayness to them. For instance, is last night&#8217;s dinner really a business meal or was it more of a personal nature? I&#8217;m talking about things that are <SPAN class=cmitalic>distinct</SPAN>. Let&#8217;s take a look at the most common areas of tax fraud. You might be surprised by a few of them.</A></P><A id=page_70>
<H4>Paying Yourself a Below-Market Wage</H4>
<P class=noindent>In chapter 1 I explained that using an S corporation to avoid payroll taxes is on the IRS&#8217;s Dirty Dozen tax scams list, and it&#8217;s an audit flag. Here&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a big issue: Let&#8217;s say you don&#8217;t pay yourself a market-based wage of $100,000 so you can avoid paying self-employment, Social Security, and Medicare taxes. That&#8217;s about $15,000 in tax savings on Social Security and Medicare alone (15.3 percent is the employer and employee portion), which is a significant amount of money. If you have a two-shareholder business, you&#8217;re avoiding around $30,000 a year in taxes.</P>
<P class=indent>People try to excuse this tactic by saying they don&#8217;t take a salary from the business; they just take distributions. Unfortunately, the IRS doesn&#8217;t see it this way. They consider distributions to be the equivalent of salaries, especially when you take them in a frequency similar to a paycheck.</P>
<H4>Getting Involved in Offshore Activities</H4>
<P class=noindent>Another big area of cheating involves offshore activity. It&#8217;s certainly a high level of focus at the IRS. There are legitimate offshore activities, of course. In the 2010 health care reform bill, Congress codified the concept of the <SPAN class=cmitalic>economic substance rule</SPAN>. This essentially says that any transaction conducted merely for the benefit of saving taxes doesn&#8217;t have economic substance. In such cases, the transaction and the business entity aren&#8217;t considered legitimate.</P>
<P class=indent>There have been some high-profile celebrities who have been caught in offshore activities, and investment firms have been in the news for concealing foreign bank accounts. Don&#8217;t get involved in offshore activities unless it is essential to the operation of your business. This issue reaches the top levels of the IRS, so it&#8217;s just not worth it.</P></A>
<H4><A id=page_70><A id=page_71>Running Personal Expenses Through Your Business</A></H4><A id=page_71>
<P class=noindent>Another area of widespread cheating is the intentional miscoding of expenses, which happens when a business owner fraudulently runs personal expenses through a closely held business. This is different from the sloppy practice of living off distributions that I talked about in chapter 4. I&#8217;m referring to when a business owner does something like building a house and paying for it out of the business.</P>
<P class=indent>I wish I could say this doesn&#8217;t happen, but I know it does. Sometimes the expenses aren&#8217;t as extravagant as building a house, but I know of tax preparers who have found business owners paying for things like home repairs out of their business. This makes me think about the times I&#8217;ve been an expert witness in divorce cases. Spouses have been known to throw each other under the bus for tax noncompliance. It&#8217;s funny to imagine the IRS sitting through divorce hearings, but that sure would be an easy place to find taxpayers with noncompliance issues.</P>
<H4>Working Off the Books</H4>
<P class=noindent>Everybody knows about businesses that take cash and don&#8217;t report it. But did you know that working off the books also includes bartering? Bartering is not illegal as long as you record it and it is for a legitimate business expense, but it&#8217;s illegal to trade a legitimate business expense for something that is for your personal benefit.</P>
<P class=indent>There have been a lot of exchanges set up across the country where people try to barter legitimately, but arrangements like this usually struggle. If the business you&#8217;re bartering with goes out of business, you&#8217;re left holding the bag with unused credits. Bartering may seem simple, but it&#8217;s actually more complicated than using cash. Humans began using currency thousands of years ago to simplify business transactions and avoid the problems with bartering. Somebody always gets the short end of the deal. That is why I advise my clients to avoid bartering and stick to cash payments.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_71>Bartering can also be fraudulent. Let&#8217;s say I have a tax preparation <A id=page_72>business and a hair stylist needs my services. The stylist agrees to cut my hair in exchange for a free tax return. This is wrong because I can&#8217;t deduct haircuts as a business expense. But believe me, people have tried it!</A></P><A id=page_72>
<H4>Not Filing Tax Forms for Subcontractors</H4>
<P class=noindent>If you have a subcontractor, you must give that person a 1099. You&#8217;re not helping a subcontractor by not issuing a 1099. At my firm, we require subcontractors to fill out a W-9 form and give their taxpayer ID number before they can get paid. That way we don&#8217;t have to chase them down at the end of the year when we send 1099s. You&#8217;re only hurting yourself if you aren&#8217;t vigilant about this, since you are aiding them in avoiding taxes. The government can only collect from the people who are compliant, so if I am compliant, why would I want to help someone cheat? In the end, it makes me pay a larger share of the taxes.</P>
<P class=indent>This rule is not as bad as a lot of people think. I&#8217;ve found that the people who complain about the 1099 filing requirements are the people who really don&#8217;t want to report their income.</P>

CASH VERSUS ACCRUAL</SPAN></H3>
<P class=noindent>So you did your taxes and you didn&#8217;t make any money. The most common reason for this is that you used cash-basis reporting. Simply put, if you work this year and bill the client $100,000 for your services, but at the end of the year the client hasn&#8217;t paid you, then you don&#8217;t have to report the income this year. You don&#8217;t report it until you get paid. But the thing is, you haven&#8217;t made any money yet. You can&#8217;t feed your family based on $100,000 in receivables.</P>
<P class=indent>The cash-basis method is a very valuable approach. It&#8217;s the best methodology to reflect when the cash shows up as well as when it doesn&#8217;t. The only time you wouldn&#8217;t want to use a cash basis is when you consistently get paid before you have to pay your vendors, which is rare.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_72>In the previous chapter I briefly mentioned the rare circumstances <A id=page_73>when you might need to use an accrual system. To understand these differences, you have to look at the balance of your accounts receivable less your accounts payable and accrued expenses. If your accounts receivable are $250,000 and your accounts payable plus accrued expenses are $100,000, you have $150,000 of taxable income that you are postponing to a future year. This is because you have not collected the accounts receivable yet, and you have not paid the accounts payable or accrued expenses.</A></P><A id=page_73>
<P class=indent>If you get paid in advance for services, it&#8217;s still taxed whether it&#8217;s cash or accrual, unless it is contractually structured as a refundable deposit. It may still be hard to win the argument in an audit if all of the facts are not in your favor. If you decide the risk is not worth it, use the accrual basis and accrue the expenses when they correspond to the revenue.</P>

<P class=noindent>I&#8217;ve already mentioned how spending money to avoid taxes is a dumb idea. This example further demonstrates how this hurts both you and your business. Let&#8217;s assume Rick is my top sales guy. I owe Rick a $100,000 bonus at the end of the year because he knocked it out of the park with sales. At the end of the year I say, &#8220;Rick, good job! I owe you $100,000, but unfortunately the IRS is going to take 40 percent of that in payroll taxes, income taxes, and state taxes. I know how much you despise the IRS because you&#8217;ve got those bumper stickers on your car that say so. I decided to stick it to the IRS on your behalf!&#8221; So I take that $100,000 I was supposed to pay Rick and spend it on new computers for the office. How do you think that makes Rick feel?</P>
<P class=indent>As the owner of a business who&#8217;s getting rid of $100,000 of profit so you don&#8217;t have to pay any taxes, you&#8217;re just like Rick, the sales guy who didn&#8217;t get his bonus. You wasted $60,000 of the after-tax money that you needed to build wealth and repay debt so you could avoid paying $40,000 in taxes. I&#8217;ve seen this year after year and client after client. You&#8217;re just lying to yourself when you take this approach.</P></A>

TIMING IS EVERYTHING</SPAN></A></H3><A id=page_74>
<P class=noindent>That leads us into the biggest issue: the timing of taxes. Let&#8217;s take a closer look. Say you have $100,000 in profits, but you decided not to take the money out of the business in distributions. You want to avoid paying taxes, so you buy a piece of equipment with 100 percent financing. You&#8217;ll lower your tax bracket and pay as little as possible this year, but next year you&#8217;ll pay at the top bracket. If you had waited to buy the equipment, you could have paid an average of 25 to 28 percent per year. You have to think about taxes on an ongoing basis.</P>
<P class=indent>Most entrepreneurs either don&#8217;t want to know what their taxes are or they don&#8217;t have a tax advisor who constantly monitors what the tax impact of business decisions will be. You have a tendency to pay taxes on business profits when you file your tax return, which is usually somewhere between April and October of the following year. If your pretax profits are up one year and down the next, you&#8217;ll underpay your taxes in the good year, and you&#8217;ll pay a lot of taxes for the prior year during your bad year. This kind of cycle is a business killer. Realistically, you should be paying last year&#8217;s taxes with the tax funds you set aside last year. Even if that year is a bad year, those tax payments are being made with cash that was already set aside for the purpose, so it&#8217;s okay.</P>
<P class=indent>Now you can see why tax management is the first of the four forces of cash flow that we discussed in chapter 4. Almost every entrepreneur who has a flow-through entity&#8212;which is an S corporation, LLC, or partnership&#8212;is confused about whether the company&#8217;s taxes are coming from this year&#8217;s profits or from last year&#8217;s profits.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_74>A lot of people invest in LLCs and S corporations and complain that they pay taxes and never get any money out of their business. If the tax payments are timed correctly, that shouldn&#8217;t happen. People think taxes are complex. At a detail level, they are, but at a macro level, they aren&#8217;t. All you&#8217;re trying to do on a quarter-by-quarter basis is get close enough to the actual amount you&#8217;ll owe so you know whether to send a payment <A id=page_75>or hold it back. Either way, you have to take the money out of your financial equation.</A></P><A id=page_75></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_75>Have your tax advisor create a simple tax calculation template that you can review each quarter, or you can download a tax calculation spreadsheet for an LLC or an S corporation from my website, <A href="http://www.seeingbeyondnumbers.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>www.seeingbeyondnumbers.com</FONT></A>.

TWO APPROACHES TO TAX TIMING</SPAN></H3>
<P class=noindent>In the last chapter we talked about how waiting until the end of the year to think about your taxes leaves you with only bad options. In this section I will describe two approaches to timing your tax payments to avoid those bad options. But first let&#8217;s look at underpayment penalties. The IRS put the underpayment penalty in place to make you pay your taxes evenly throughout the year and not wait until the end of the year&#8212;unless you meet the exceptions for the prior year taxes paid or the pay-as-you-go approach, which I&#8217;ll describe shortly.</P>
<H4>Safe Harbor</H4>
<P class=noindent>The first approach to timing tax payments is called <SPAN class=cmitalic>safe harbor</SPAN>. This year you pay either what you paid in taxes last year, or, if your <SPAN class=cmitalic>taxable income</SPAN> (gross income from all sources less deductions and personal exemptions) is above a certain threshold, you pay 110 percent of what you paid last year (see <A href="http://www.irs.gov/"><FONT color=#0066cc>www.irs.gov</FONT></A> and search for Form 2210 instructions for the current rules). In the latter case, if you paid $10,000 in taxes last year, then you should plan to pay $11,000 this year ($10,000 x 1.10). If your pretax profits go way up and you owe $1 million in taxes by April 15 of next year, you won&#8217;t owe the difference until April 15, and you will not incur an underpayment penalty.</P>
<P class=indent><A id=page_76>You can see the difference in scale of going from $10,000 in taxes one year to $1 million in taxes the next year. It&#8217;s obviously important that you have the million dollars when it comes time to pay your taxes, but you&#8217;d be surprised at how many people don&#8217;t plan for this. I&#8217;ve had clients who had to sell their business, or at least segments of their business, to pay taxes. If my clients have a special income event and the IRS rules allow them to wait until April 15 to pay taxes on that, I tell them to buy a Certificate of Deposit that matures on April 10. This prevents them from touching that money for any reason.</A></P><A id=page_76>
<H4>Pay as You Go</H4>
<P class=noindent>The second approach is to pay as you go and make estimated payments on your taxes throughout the year. The payment dates are divided into four periods:</P>
<TABLE class=tborder1 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="90%" border=0>
<COLGROUP>
<COL width="50%">
<COL width="50%">
<TBODY>
<TR>

<P class=table>Due April 15</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD class=tborder vAlign=top>
<P class=table>April 1&#8212;May 31</P></TD>

<TR>
<TD class=tborder vAlign=top>
<P class=table>September 1&#8212;December 31</P></TD>
<TD class=tborder vAlign=top>
<P class=table>Due January 15 of next year</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P class=indent>To use this method, ask yourself what you made in the first quarter, and calculate the tax on that (40 percent). If you pay that amount, you don&#8217;t incur an underpayment penalty. For the second quarter, take your profit to date times the tax rate minus what you paid as an estimate in the first quarter. That&#8217;s what you owe for the second quarter. Repeat this for the third and fourth quarters.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_76>This is the easiest way to track what you owe. The only danger of the pay-as-you-go approach is that you can have really good first and second quarters but then have some losses in the third and fourth quarters. This results in your annual income being exaggerated in the first half of the year, so your tax payments for that time period may be larger than needed, and you will have to file your return before you can get your <A id=page_77>overpayment back. When I manage this for my clients, I have them pay the <SPAN class=cmitalic>least</SPAN> amount possible under the safe harbor or the pay-as-you-go methods. I have them create a separate bank account to hold the tax money for any taxes they owe above the safe harbor method.</A></P><A id=page_77>
<H4>Timing Tax Payments to Your Best Advantage</H4>
<P class=noindent>If my clients&#8217; taxes for the previous year were higher because their taxable income this year is down, I have them use the pay-as-you-go method. I don&#8217;t want them burning up good core capital by paying their taxes way too far in advance, which is what would happen if they used the safe harbor approach. Their core capital is a very precious resource, so it&#8217;s not good enough for me to just make a simple calculation and tell them to base their payments on 110 percent of the prior year tax if they exceed the threshold.</P>

TAXES AND THE PERSONAL SIDE OF YOUR FINANCIAL LIFE</SPAN></H3>
<P class=noindent>Let&#8217;s look at our favorite cow analogy and extend it to your personal life. If you don&#8217;t keep your cow healthy so you can milk it every day, you&#8217;re not going to have an economic engine to be able to distribute wealth to the personal side of your life. Many times people try to live off the profit distributions of the business, and then there&#8217;s nothing left over for wealth creation. Here&#8217;s where the tax side of that makes a big difference.</P>
<H4>A Perfect Scenario</H4>
<P class=noindent>In a perfect scenario, you should pay yourself a market-based wage for what you do. Then withhold taxes from that wage as if the business is going to make zero profits. The goal is to be able to take your salary, pay your taxes on your salary, and live off the net amount. Base your lifestyle on the net amount, and you won&#8217;t have to rely on distributions to pay your personal bills.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_77><A id=page_78>If you make $100,000 a year in wages for your role in your business, put that salary plus your spouse&#8217;s salary into a tax projection and determine what your withholdings should be to break even&#8212;not to get a refund, but to break even. To determine how much should be withheld from your salary, assume that the business will make nothing. If the business makes a profit beyond your salary, the business should make a <SPAN class=cmitalic>tax distribution</SPAN> to cover the taxes it caused you to pay.</A></P><A id=page_78>
<P class=indent>There&#8217;s no terminology within the tax code that refers to a distribution as a <SPAN class=cmitalic>tax distribution</SPAN> or a <SPAN class=cmitalic>profit distribution</SPAN>. I use these terms to differentiate the purposes of distributions. They can be made to cover taxes, or they can be made to distribute profit. When your business makes a profit on a quarter-by-quarter basis, the first distributions are made to pay the taxes. It is imperative that you don&#8217;t spend this on anything else. Either make an estimated tax payment or set it aside to pay taxes later.</P>
<P class=indent>Business owners commonly misunderstand that your taxable income in an S corporation or an LLC is not based on your distributions (except in rare circumstances); it is based on your share of the net profit of the business, regardless of whether you take distributions or not. In some multiple-shareholder cases, one shareholder has to pay taxes though another one doesn&#8217;t. When tax distributions are paid to shareholders, one or more of them will invariably spend it instead of paying taxes with it. Then at tax time they will come back to the business and ask for cash flow help.</P>
<P class=indent>After the tax distributions have been made, you can take profit distributions. Use them to build your emergency fund and repay your personal debt until it&#8217;s gone. After that, you can start investing and building true wealth.</P>
<H4>A Nightmare Scenario</H4></A>
<P class=noindent><A id=page_78>A nightmare scenario is when you&#8217;re living off your salary <SPAN class=cmitalic>and</SPAN> your distributions. You haven&#8217;t set aside anything for taxes. Your tax preparer extends your tax return until October, which is the extended due date, <A id=page_79>and you find out on the due date that you owe taxes for the profits the company made last year as well as your salary.</A></P><A id=page_79>
<P class=indent>Because you don&#8217;t have money set aside for taxes, you use the IRS as your creditor and do an installment agreement. Or you might start thinking that next year will be better, so you just don&#8217;t file your return. You figure the IRS won&#8217;t know about it, and you&#8217;ll get caught up financially so you can pay the taxes. One year turns into two, which turns into three, then five, then six. I&#8217;ve had people come to me who have essentially gone underground for five to seven years, and they say they&#8217;re ready to become legitimate and get caught up. It&#8217;s so sad when businesses haven&#8217;t filed their tax returns. Eventually, something will trip the wire with the IRS and they&#8217;ll find out you&#8217;ve been underground.</P>
<P class=indent>Don&#8217;t take that chance with your business. Choose the perfect scenario and avoid a nightmare for yourself and your business.
