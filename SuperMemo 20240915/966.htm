Ask yourself how much you need for rent, office supplies, telephones, products, and all the other essential things. Costs that stay essentially the same regardless of sales volume are referred to as fixed costs. If you sell goods, your nonsalary costs include the cost of goods sold for the products you sell. You can predict that number because you know what you have to buy. These costs will vary based on sales volume, so they are referred to as variable costs. There are also <SPAN class=cmitalic>step-variable</SPAN> costs. That means you have to add the cost before you can fully use the cost you are adding.

<P class=noindent>Determining your salary cap is the best way to achieve your required labor productivity. Imagine you&#8217;ve got a million-dollar revenue business. You want the business to have at least a 10 percent pretax profit. If you&#8217;re not at 10 percent already, you have to try to get there. If you&#8217;re already above 10 percent, you don&#8217;t want to go backward.</P>
<P class=indent>Take a look at exhibit 3.3 and to see how to start calculating your salary cap.</P>
<P class=imagea><img alt=image src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-straight-talk-big-profits-9781608322398/OEBPS/images/t0041-01.jpg"></P>
<P class=noindent>At 10 percent, the pretax profit on $1 million in revenue is $100,000. Simple math, right? You can see in exhibit 3.4 that I have $900,000 to allot to two types of expenses: salaries and nonsalary costs.</P>
<P class=noindent></A></P>

<P class=indent>Your nonsalary costs are easy to come up with. You don&#8217;t need a consultant to figure it out. The data is in your numbers and you just have to do the math. <SPAN class=extract>Ask yourself how much you need for rent, office supplies, telephones, products, and all the other essential things. Costs that stay essentially the same regardless of sales volume are referred to as fixed costs. If you sell goods, your nonsalary costs include the cost of goods sold for the products you sell. You can predict that number because you know what you have to buy. These costs will vary based on sales volume, so they are referred to as variable costs. There are also <SPAN class=cmitalic>step-variable</SPAN> costs. That means you have to add the cost before you can fully use the cost you are adding.</SPAN><SPAN class=extract></P>
<P class=indent>Entrepreneur: <SPAN class=cmitalic>Would office space that you rent be an example of a step-variable cost?</SPAN></P>
<P class=blockquote>Greg: <SPAN class=cmitalic>Exactly! Your rent is fixed until you outgrow your space and you have to either move or add on. But people are an example of this cost, too. That&#8217;s why I say that you should add that person at the last possible moment. You don&#8217;t get full productivity out of a new hire right away, but you get productivity to a point. If I hire a sales manager to manage two salespeople, I get some productivity, but I do not maximize the value of that sales manager until he or she is managing eight to ten salespeople.</SPAN></P>
<P class=indent></SPAN></A><A id=page_42><A id=page_43>Let&#8217;s say the number you came up with for nonsalary costs is $400,000. Exhibit 3.5 continues our calculation.</A></P><A id=page_43>
<P class=imagea><img alt=image src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-straight-talk-big-profits-9781608322398/OEBPS/images/t0043-01.jpg"></P>
<P class=indent>Now you can plug in the salaries number, as shown in exhibit 3.6. A little quick math says you have $500,000 to spend on wages. Remember, <SPAN class=cmitalic>your market-based salary is included in that $500,000</SPAN>.</P>
<P class=imagea><img alt=image src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-straight-talk-big-profits-9781608322398/OEBPS/images/t0043-02.jpg"></P>
<P class=indent>It doesn&#8217;t matter if your employees are part-time, full-time, or if you&#8217;ve hired your cousin or your spouse. You have a $500,000 salary cap. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you give incentive pay or hourly pay. The sum of all W-2s at the end of the year cannot exceed $500,000. It&#8217;s no more complex than that.</P>
