The input from profit is easy to understand. Normally goods are sold at a price that exceeds total cost. For instance if goods that cost $100 are sold at a price of $125, the $25 profit will quickly flow into the business in the form of cash.

<P>It is not easy to see why this should be. What is so special about depreciation? The answer is that, for most companies, depreciation is the only cost item in the profit and loss account that does not have a cash out-flow attached to it. While referred to as a source of cash, it is really the avoidance of a cash out-flow. This point is more fully developed in the following section.</P>
<P>It must be emphasized that, even though depreciation does not have a related cash out-flow, it is a true cost nevertheless. The relevant cash out-flow has simply taken place at an earlier time. At the time the associated fixed assets were purchased, the cash cost was not charged against profits. It was, instead, charged to the balance sheet. As the asset is used up, an appropriate amount of cost is released into the profit and loss account. This is what depreciation is all about.
