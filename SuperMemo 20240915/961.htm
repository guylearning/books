When businesses go through tough times, everybody thinks first about cutting costs. My experience always leads me back to one key factor: labor productivity. Nothing of value happens without labor productivity. Even something like overspending on kitchen supplies can be traced back to a lack of productivity by the person responsible for that task.

When you are below $1 million in revenue, you are a lot closer to what is happening, so you can monitor labor productivity more closely. Once you go past $1 million, your biggest challenge is getting the required productivity for every dollar you spend on labor. I refer to labor dollars instead of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, because counting heads does not give you the proper understanding of your true profit model. Focus on your gross profit per labor dollar as your key indicator for labor productivity.
