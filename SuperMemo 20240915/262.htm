<P>In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="527" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>, you always need to quickly recover the context of a question or a piece of text. The easiest way to recover context quickly is via references. References propagate from <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="528" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">element</A> to element as you produce <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="529" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extracts</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="530" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletions</A>. With all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Child" data-hasqtip="531" oldtitle="Glossary:Child">child elements</A> produced from a given text marked with references, you would never need to worry about losing the context of the question. </P>
<P>For example: </P>
<DIV class=center>
<DIV class=inset style="BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 800px; BORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; TEXT-ALIGN: left; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid">
<P><B>Q</B>: He was born in <SPAN class=cloze>[...](year)</SPAN> </P></DIV></DIV>
<P>cannot be answered without the context. However, the following question is already easier to understand: </P>
<DIV class=center>
<DIV class=inset style="BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 800px; BORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; TEXT-ALIGN: left; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid">

<HR>

<P><SPAN class=reference>#Title: Barrack Obama<BR>#Source: Wikipedia</SPAN> </P></DIV></DIV>
<P>To speed up learning, in the incremental reading process, the above question should naturally be replaced with: </P>
<DIV class=center>
<DIV class=inset style="BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 800px; BORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; TEXT-ALIGN: left; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid">

<P>References are not stored in HTML files that hold your articles but in a reference <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Registry" data-hasqtip="532" oldtitle="Glossary:Registry">registry</A> (i.e. in a separate database). The reference registry does not hold the text of references either. All reference texts are held in the text <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Registry" data-hasqtip="533" oldtitle="Glossary:Registry">registry</A> and are available for global text searches. In earlier versions of SuperMemo, each text would keep its own copy of references. In newer SuperMemos, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="534" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">elements</A> keep only pointers to reference <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Registry" data-hasqtip="535" oldtitle="Glossary:Registry">registry</A>, which in turn keeps pointers to individual text fields in the text registry. As a result, many <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="536" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">elements</A> can hold the same reference, and many references can hold the same text. This results in a significant saving in space in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="537" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A>. More importantly, you can update the reference in a single <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="538" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">element</A> and see the change show in all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="539" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">elements</A> using the same reference. This way, you do not need to waste time on search&amp;replace to correct a single misspelling or reference inaccuracy that propagated to many <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="540" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">elements</A>. </P><SPLIT1>

While learning about the greenhouse effect, the student extracts the fragment saying that "An ideal thermally conductive <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbody">blackbody</A> at the same distance from the Sun as Earth would have a temperature of about 5.3&nbsp;&#176;C.

The mechanism that produces this difference between the actual surface temperature and the effective temperature is due to the atmosphere and is known as <B>greenhouse effect</B>". The extracted fragment will inherit illustrations placed on the right, as well as article <A title=References href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">references</A>. The student can move on to reading another article by pressing Enter.

<LI>Reference fields <SPAN class=reference>#Article</SPAN>, <SPAN class=reference>#Parent</SPAN> and <SPAN class=reference>#Concept group</SPAN> are added automatically and are not stored in the reference <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Registry" data-hasqtip="545" oldtitle="Glossary:Registry">registry</A>. These fields are not generated in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="546" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">elements</A> that have no other reference fields defined 
<LI>References marked with <I>Alt+Q</I> options show up in the reference field and can be deleted from the text's body (if no longer needed) 
<LI>Hover your mouse over the <B>Reference link</B> button (<A title="SuperMemo: Reference button on the navigation bar in the element window" class=image href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Reference_button.gif"><img alt="SuperMemo: Reference button on the navigation bar in the element window" src="https://help.supermemo.org/images/9/9e/Reference_button.gif" width=16 height=16 decoding="async"></A>) on the <A title="Navigation bar" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Navigation_bar">navigation bar</A> to quickly see the reference in longer extracts. 
<LI>From the user's point of view, there is a little difference in the way the references are handled as compared with earlier SuperMemos. SuperMemo 2008 or later differentiates between the following 2 types of references edits: 
<UL>
<LI><B>local edits</B> that affect only the present <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="547" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">element</A> and create a new reference record vs. 
<LI><B>global edits</B> which change the original reference in all the elements that use it.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<DL>
<DD>When SuperMemo is not sure if your edits are local or global, it will ask you</DD></DL>
<UL>
<LI>Note that all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="548" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extracts</A> generate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="549" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">elements</A> that are <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Child" data-hasqtip="550" oldtitle="Glossary:Child">children</A> of the original article. If you have problems with recalling the original context of a fragment, you can always call it back by pressing the <B>Parent</B> button on the <A title="Navigation bar" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Navigation_bar">navigation bar</A>. You can also use the <STRONG>Reference link</STRONG> button (<A title="SuperMemo: Reference button on the navigation bar in the element window" class=image href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Reference_button.gif"><img alt="SuperMemo: Reference button on the navigation bar in the element window" src="https://help.supermemo.org/images/9/9e/Reference_button.gif" width=16 height=16 decoding="async"></A>) to get to the source article, or, if you have already reached it, to get to the original article on the web. 
<LI>If you choose an empty selection for the <SPAN class=reference>#Date</SPAN> reference, you will mark the text with the current date and time stamp 
<LI>AND-Search in SuperMemo works on texts, not on <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="551" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">elements</A>. This means that reference texts do not take part in AND-Search for the main body of text. This may result in false misses. In SuperMemo, texts and individual reference fields are all treated as separate texts and are all searched independently 
<LI>Formatting of references can be changed via stylesheets 
<LI>Converting HTML to plain text does not affect the formatting of references (i.e. plain text entries can have their references formatted by a stylesheet) 
<LI>You can edit references in the reference area or in a dedicated window that you can open by choosing <B><A title="Element menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu#Reference">Reference</A>&nbsp;: Edit</B> from the <A title="Element menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu">element menu</A>. You only need to use legal reference field tags at the beginning of each reference line (e.g. <SPAN class=reference>#Author:</SPAN>). If SuperMemo is not sure if your changes should apply to the current <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="552" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">element</A> only, or to all elements that use the reference, it will ask you 
<LI>You can quickly modify (i.e. set, merge, and delete) the references across a number of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="553" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">elements</A>.

<LI>References no longer clutter your HTML files. In the past, the size of references would often be greater than the length of the text itself 
<LI>Reference <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Registry" data-hasqtip="555" oldtitle="Glossary:Registry">registry</A> keeps the references (see below), and their individual text fields are stored in the text registry 
<LI>References are added to HTML texts at load time, so that you can still have references located at the bottom of your texts as in earlier versions of SuperMemo 
<LI>Adding an existing reference to an <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="556" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">element</A> (e.g. with <B><A title="Element menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu#Reference">Reference</A>&nbsp;: Link</B> from the <A title="Element menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu">element menu</A>) does not add to the size of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="557" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A></LI></UL>

<P>You an use <B>Reference: Edit</B> in <A title="SuperMemo Commander" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo_Commander">SuperMemo Commander</A>, however, you can also edit references in the reference area (which is pink in the default stylesheet). You can safely delete reference fields, but you need to decide if that change should be local (for that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="569" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">element</A> only) or global (for all elements using this reference). You will not be able to delete <SPAN class=reference>#Article</SPAN>, <SPAN class=reference>#Parent:</SPAN> or <SPAN class=reference>#Concept group</SPAN> fields because they are added automatically to the reference section (i.e. they are not part of the reference itself). You can freely change the text of references. Illegal changes are all changes that do not comply with the reference format, e.g. lines that do not start with reference field tags, or lines that start with unknown reference field tags (e.g. <I>#Country</I>). If you are unsure how this process works, import a single article from <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> to a newly created <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="570" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A>, create some <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="571" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extracts</A> and play with editing to see how references are processed. </P><SPLIT1>

<P>Image references are created automatically when importing from the web or from an HTML document. In SuperMemo 16, unless you imported images with whole references pages, duplicate detection would depend on image names. If you renamed your images to make reuse easy, duplicate detection wouldn't work. This changed with SuperMemo 17. URLs are kept in the text <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Registry" data-hasqtip="572" oldtitle="Glossary:Registry">registry</A> which can accept a degree of "garbage" as text reuse is automatic. The adopted complex solution may make SuperMemo a bit slower when importing images from imported articles or when importing pictures from the web. However, your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="573" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A> is unlikely to swell with multiple image duplicates. Duplicate imports are automatically prevented and the imported image is replaced with the stored original (wiki thumbs are replaced with their high-resolution originals). </P>

<P>Incremental learning is powerful. Even though we strongly believe it might spell a revolution in learning, its present incarnation will reach only a small fraction of society. This is why: </P>
<UL>
<LI>Most of people will never arrive to this website. A great part of this planet do not have access to the Internet. Of those who are privileged enough to be able to use <A class="external text" href="http://google.com">Google</A> or <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> on a regular basis, most are too busy with work, family and other pursuits. The rest are busy with <A class="external text" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</A>, <A class="external text" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</A>, games and other "blessings" of the Internet. 
<LI>A significant fraction of the users of the Internet realize that the web offers incredible self-help opportunities. However, a substantial portion of those will suffer from a cognitive bias known as the <B>illusion of knowledge</B>. This bias does not spare highly intelligent individuals. Under the illusion of knowledge, we are less motivated to seek more learning. With less learning, the learn drive diminishes with age providing a negative feedback of inaction 
<LI>Users of the Internet who are highly interested in learning quickly discover that their memory can be improved, and that their learning can be advanced to a new level with some help from the net or software. However, the language barrier is another big sieve. The best materials about learning techniques have been published in English. Language divisions result in a global inequality in the access to information. You can read about SuperMemo in a couple of major languages. Perhaps you might learn about <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="705" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A> too. The article you are reading now will take months or years to percolate to non-English areas of the net! 
<LI>For anyone interested in learning, it does not take long to find out about <I><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" data-hasqtip="706" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</A></I>. The term was quite exotic when first used in the context of SuperMemo in the mid 1990s. In those days it could only be found in a couple of scientific publications. However, it was SuperMemo that helped popularize the concept, which now has entered the popular culture. Those who seek better memory will quickly be informed that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" data-hasqtip="707" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</A> is the way. They will get their introduction to <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" data-hasqtip="708" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</A> from <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/english/down.htm">SuperMemo freeware</A>, or an array of other excellent free spaced repetition applications, some of which use older SuperMemo algorithms. The fact that the newest SuperMemo is a commercial product will prevent many potentially excellent students from ever going in the direction of incremental learning. This must be made clear then. At the moment of writing, <A class="external text" href="http://www.freewarefiles.com/SuperMemo_program_13849.html">SuperMemo 2004 is freeware</A> and supports <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="709" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>. It might be missing the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" data-hasqtip="710" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue">priority queue</A>, but this will matter only much later in the process when you build a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="711" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A> of unmanageable size. In <A class="external text" href="http://www.freewarefiles.com/SuperMemo_program_13849.html">SuperMemo 2004</A> you can do <B>Import</B>, <B>Extract</B> and <B>Cloze</B>. That's the core of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="712" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>! 
<LI>Among users of SuperMemo, only a fraction will ever become interested in a complex concept of incremental learning (probably still below 5%). A typical newcomer is more likely to drop out altogether than to move on to the next level. The chief culprit is the incompatibility of SuperMemo with the human nature and the modern lifestyle. Stressful and busy lives do not help in forging new paths and acquiring new habits. It is not just that humans like to live in their comfort zones. It is also that the pressures of the modern dog-eat-dog society are pretty effective in stifling higher inspiration, lifelong learning, creative pursuits beyond one's job, etc. Those issues are inherent (human nature), or systemic. As such they cannot be easily remedied. 
<LI>Some users might hold a relatively positive opinion about <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="713" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>, but will excuse their lack of commitment by technological limitations of SuperMemo. For example, "<I>unless you give me a Mac version, I won't go there</I>", "<I>I hate Internet Explorer</I>", "<I>Your interface comes from Windows 98 era</I>" or "<I>I will come back if you have a mobile version</I>". Incidentally, there is an inherent incompatibility between mobility and incremental learning. Mobility correlates with multitasking and low attention (interaction with others, social media notifications, arriving mail, phone calls, browser pop-ups, etc.). The power of incremental learning lies in balancing creativity with attention. As such, incremental learning is inherently immobile (unless you understand mobility as a transfer between two or more peaceful and static environments). In addition, without a standard-size keyboard, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="714" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A> might feel like paddling up the creek. 
<LI>Among those users of SuperMemo who get down to reading about incremental learning, a large proportion will come with a preconceived goal: proving that incremental learning is not really worth the investment of time. "Negative reading" is more likely to occur in a bad state of mind: low-spirits, irritation, or reading outside one's <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Optimizing_the_timing_of_brainwork">optimum circadian brainwork bracket</A>. This preconception may be largely subconscious and based on a defense mechanism: proving that incremental learning is a weak concept is easy, should save one a great deal of investment in mastering the concept, and prevent the need to leave one's comfort zone. Discovering that incremental learning is a must will simply augur long hours of plodding through the documentation that is notorious for its poor readability index. The presented article is harder to read than 70% of articles at <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>. The ultimate judgement is strongly correlated with your present state of mind. You are more likely to say "<I>Incremental learning is full of fluff</I>" or "<I>Incremental learning goes against human nature</I>" than to say "<I>I have discovered a new great technology that will change my life</I>". You might be just seeking affirmation of your preset frame of mind: "<I>Incremental learning must be a hoax or at least a waste of time</I>", or simply "<I>Incremental learning is not of much use in my particular profession</I>". It is easy to find the desired confirmation. Imperfections in this article will provide a rich material for dismissal. A perfection is not achievable. Prejudiced mind will always find a way to misinterpret. Naturally, if you are enthusiastic about incremental learning at your first encounter, this is a very good predictor of your ultimate success. 
<LI>Having passed all this rich obstacle course, you are now bound to be in a tiny group of people who arrived at this point. The good news is that you might be part of a special elite. People with fertile minds who are open to new challenges, motivated well enough and self-disciplined enough. Naturally, you might have equally well come here exhausted with your failure in learning, in hope of finding a remedy to your recent bad exam results. Whatever the answer, the road is still very long. Even with a brisk mind and great enthusiasm, you may still drop out at later stages. 
<LI>When reading about incremental learning, you might hit another major obstacle: "<I>This is more convoluted than I thought!</I>", or "<I>The whole idea of <A title="Priority queue" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Priority_queue">prioritization</A> makes me nauseous</I>", or "<I>The toolset may be rich but is it natural?</I>". You can get discouraged either by incomplete understanding of the concept, or the incompatibility of the concept with your personality. 
<LI>If you have already decided to try incremental learning, and you have <A class="external text" href="http://super-memo.com/supermemo17.html">SuperMemo 17</A> installed, you may get an unpleasant shock. <A class="external text" href="http://super-memo.com/supermemo17.html">SuperMemo 17</A> is not user friendly! It has been optimized for pro users and only simplified enough at lower levels (<B><A title="File menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File_menu">File</A>&nbsp;: <A title=Levels href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Levels">Level</A></B>) to make it somewhat palatable for a novice. You can overcome this impression only with a firm belief: incremental learning works and it is worth the investment of my time. After a year, you may love the solutions you hated in SuperMemo at first. User unfriendliness and complexity will make many give up in the first days or weeks. Those dropouts rarely return! We are guilty here too. New solutions are never perfectly encapsulated and/or interfaced. You will get your neat iPad and Android version only when incremental learning is more popular, which is not anytime soon. 
<LI>The dropout rate in the first weeks is still high. Some of the main problems: importing unsuitable text, difficulty in parsing the text with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="715" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extracts</A>, losing context of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="716" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extracts</A>, comprehension problems (not related to SuperMemo), <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="717" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">clozing</A> texts that are too complex, <A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">difficulty in formulating items</A>, excessive time spent on formatting and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Template" data-hasqtip="718" oldtitle="Glossary:Template">templates</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Overload" data-hasqtip="719" oldtitle="Glossary:Overload">learning overload</A>, confusion, problems with SuperMemo (e.g. layouts), lack of sense of progress, etc. Without clear gratification, many users come to the conclusion that the cost is greater than the benefits. They are not wrong. It is not easy to get a return on your investment in a month or even longer. Few users start their learning swiftly on a wave of solid enthusiasm! 
<LI>Many of the advantages of incremental learning rely on the size of your learning <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="720" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A>. The value of <A title="Subset learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning#Search_and_review">search&amp;review</A> increases with the size of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="721" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A>. At the beginning of the process, when <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="722" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A> is small, and as a result knowledge-poor, you may feel like laying the first brick of a large pyramid on a vast boring desert. The greatest fun can be found at the top of the pyramid, when you can see the extent of your knowledge in a good perspective. This metaphor should not imply your pyramid will ever stop growing. You keep adding stone blocks to the sides. The pyramid keeps growing high and wide for lifetime. 
<LI>The extent of failure does not only cover the dropouts and the never-has-beens. Even long-term users may enter a never-ending struggle with <A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">knowledge formulation</A>, complex material, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="723" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority">priorities</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Overload" data-hasqtip="724" oldtitle="Glossary:Overload">overload</A>, etc. The later you start, the longer the transition from pain to fun. Old habits die hard. There is one clear litmus test for success: once incremental learning is fun, you know you do things right. If you have not reached the level of fun after a couple of months of trying hard, you need to re-think your strategies. For example, you may need to start from reading this article cover-to-cover again. 
<LI>If you happen to be a happy user of incremental learning, your knowledge will keep growing fast, and your hunger for learning will keep increasing at an ever faster rate. This makes you a part of a very tiny elite. This also imposes an obligation. It is time to help others reach your level!</LI></UL><SPLIT1>

<P>A frequent reservation voiced by skeptical observers is that dismembering texts into little units will result in an inevitable loss of the ability to see things from a distance in their entirety. The question is: <I>Does incremental learning produce a loss of the big picture?</I> What the skeptics fail to appreciate is the power of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" data-hasqtip="725" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</A> that stands behind SuperMemo. The SuperMemo method ensures high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="726" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention">retention</A> of once-mastered knowledge. This means that there is minimum disintegration of the coherence of knowledge once it is understood and well modeled in student's mind. </P>
<P><B>The main advantage of SuperMemo is that you convert lots of disparate pieces of information into a solid model of reality that lives in your memory</B>. All these pieces can be dispersed randomly in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="727" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A> like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, however, they fit into a coherent entirety that stays firmly intact in your mind. In other words, incremental learning is reductionist at the level of knowledge processing, but is holistic at the level of memories stored in your brain. </P>
<P>The big picture worry comes from the fact that in traditional education, students rely heavily on their short-term memory. They cram a single subject intensely before an exam only to forget most of that knowledge in the following months unless the subject is reviewed in later courses. It is true that short-term memory can act as a glue that holds the big picture in memory. However, it is the short-term memory and the weakest long-term memories that are gone first. With that in mind, it is only natural that you might worry that if you start intermingling more than a few courses, you will end up with chaos and confusion. It is not the case with incremental learning. New memories, once established, are gradually reinforced to permanently enter the long-term storage. All incremental learning does is to help you focus on a small portion of the material at any given moment. </P>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<P><B>In traditional (unspaced) education, the big picture is maintained with the glue of short-term memories. As such it is volatile, and subject to forgetting. In incremental learning, the big picture has a lasting value!</B> </P></DIV>

<P><I>If I use incremental learning for a couple of years. How will that affect how I am perceived by others? Will they see the difference? Will I be smarter and appear smarter? Will I be able to shine with knowledge in social circles? What do people say after 20 years of using incremental learning?</I> </P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Incremental learning is just a few years old. For example, incremental reading was introduced in 2000. The essential concept of the <A title="Priority queue" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Priority_queue">priority queue</A> was introduced only in 2006. Without the priority queue, massive learning may lead to massive chaos. <A title="Incremental video" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_video">Incremental video</A> was born in 2009. So you won't find users with 20 years of experience. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Incremental_learning_is_faster class=mw-headline>Incremental learning is faster</SPAN></H3>
<P>Despite the young age of incremental learning, it is easy to theorize about its power. This is because learning incrementally isn't much different than its ultimate effect as other forms of learning (e.g. extensive reading, studying for the university, research, etc.). For that reason, the results will be comparable. The main difference is that you will get to the levels of higher knowledge much faster (assuming sufficient skills). This way, someone with a few months of intense incremental learning, may get the knowledge and act not much different than a university graduate. Naturally, incremental learning will not substitute for laboratory practice, problem solving, discussions with friends, and professors, etc. So there will be differences. You can then ask: <I>How does the university education make me into a better person?'</I>. Once you answer that question, you will have an answer about incremental learning. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=No_amount_of_learning_can_eliminate_ignorance class=mw-headline>No amount of learning can eliminate ignorance</SPAN></H3>
<P>If you hope that incremental reading will make you universally knowledgeable and smart, you are wrong. Human knowledge is vast enough for a 2-year-old to know things that a PhD does not know (esp. if the kid is trained for the trick, e.g. to answer "<I>What is the capital of Burkina Faso?</I>"). </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Incremental_readers_are_different class=mw-headline>Incremental readers are different</SPAN></H3>
<P>Incremental reading is more likely to be less focused and more general. At the university, you may learn extensively on a specific subject, while in incremental reading you are more likely to stray to multiple related areas depending on your interests and the encountered gaps in knowledge. Your priorities will reflect your individual profile and your knowledge may be far more customized to your own needs and passions. All in all, an incremental reader will not differ much from a well-learned person. The main difference may show in personality. Not because of incremental learning but due to the fact that only a few have the mental characteristics needed to get interested and then sustain the incremental reading process. Thus incremental readers may appear more knowledgeable just because of their natural curiosity or even obsession with knowledge. This quest for general knowledge may result in short moments of amazement with the gaps in knowledge exhibited by other people. In September 2013, scientists announced that <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">Voyager 1</A> entered the <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium">interstellar medium</A>. A panel of high-IQ journalists on a respected news channel discussed that historic moment. One of the journalists mentioned that Voyager 1 was launched in the 1990s and has now left the solar system. The other journalists nodded. This is where an obsessive incremental reader may pause and realize that he or she is indeed a bit different. </P>

<P>It is not how others perceive you that matters, but how you change your thinking and the ability to solve problems. In most cases, few people in your surroundings care about your problems and your goals. The knowledge you obtain for those goals will be of little interest to others (beyond a narrow circle of close friends). If you ever attempt to show off at parties, you will rather be politely dismissed as an annoyance. Being a <A class="external text" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smart%20aleck">smart aleck</A> is universally perceived in a negative light. If you shine with your knowledge in a relevant context (i.e. not for the sake of shining), the perception will be different. We all love the doctor that can provide an accurate diagnosis at a glance and instantly come up with a solution to your health problem. However, chances are rather slim that you will be able to show off your specialist knowledge at a party (unless it is a professional party of your colleagues in the field). </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Reward_in_higher_awareness class=mw-headline>Reward in higher awareness</SPAN></H3>
<P>The greatest advantage of incremental reading may show in the areas of general knowledge. These are the areas that most of people neglect due to a simple lack of time and lack of sufficient pressure or motivation. A student may need to study for his geography course, a medical researcher may need to read dozens of papers, but they both may have too little time or need to refresh the ABC of physics that might otherwise be useful in understanding things that happen around them. An obsessive incremental reader might therefore reach a sort of higher level of awareness. If you hear about a <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Chaffinch">chaffinch</A> for the first time in your life, you might likely say "<I>I have never seen that bird</I>". However, you might then be amazed if you see the bird a few times in the course of the following week. </P>
<P>With a narrow focus, few people are able to point to the galaxies that are likely to collide with the <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way">Milky Way</A>. Knowledge and understanding of similar facts and processes may seem to have little application to daily activities, however, it does seem to change how people view their place in the universe.

However, bad learning practices can result in a monumental waste of time. SuperMemo helps you eliminate the problem of forgetting. As such, it can also help you remember time-wasting garbage. The main rule of smart learning is: <B>learn what is highly applicable</B>. Learn things that change your life. Learning things that help you change the life of others. Rules are better than facts.

<P>We believe that incremental learning is the acme of learning in 2013. However, it can also make you dumber. If you take on heavy learning, you are bound to suffer from serious memory interference. This means that you will also forget much faster, esp. the things that you do not keep in SuperMemo. Instead of looking smarter, to the outside world, you might appear more forgetful and even absent-minded. You might forget events, promises, encounters, jokes, movies, and all those little memory things that we take for granted. Incidentally, this forgetfulness is also produced by <A class="external text" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</A>, <A class="external text" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</A>, and the like. In this chaotic modern world, we hardly ever have time to stop and ponder important things. These days you can buy a shower cabin or a sauna with speakers built in. It's a matter of time before you can engage into a conversation with your toilet. Perhaps you already chat with your Facebook friends while sitting on the toilet? This means that the last preserves of peaceful thinking and creativity are in danger of being swamped with information overload. This makes us smarter in a different way. However, without your rational intervention, it may work against your long-term success. The same is true about incremental learning, you must stay vigilant and learn only things that are highly relevant and applicable to your goals and your position in society. Turn off your phone in the night, leave your MP3 player at home when you go for a jogging, and keep your incremental reading in check and order. </P>

<P>Not all knowledge is of great value. Memorizing all tributaries of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River">Amazon</A> may take precious time from other areas of learning.

<P>Your learning efforts must be based on high applicability of newly acquired skills and knowledge. If you memorize the whole phone book, your problem solving ability will increase only slightly (mostly through the beneficial effect of memory training on the health of your brain). On the other hand, a simple formula for <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_payoff">expected payoff</A> may affect all decisions you make in problem solving and in life in general. It can, for example, save you years of wasted investment in lottery tickets. Millions of people are enticed with huge lottery jackpots, yet they would never agree to give up their whole income for life in order to get it back at retirement in one-off payment, which is a frequent probabilistic payoff equivalent of taking part in lotteries. Using the terminology defined above, you will find most benefit in mastering and understanding highly abstract rules of logical thinking and decision making. </P>
<P>To accomplish smart learning, you will need to constantly pay utmost attention to what material you decide to study. You must avoid short-term gratification at the cost of long-term learning. It may be great fun to learn all Roman emperors and details of their interesting lives and rule. However, unless you study with a big picture in mind (e.g. in an attempt to understand why civilizations thrive or fall), you may benefit less than by struggling through less entertaining but highly applicable formulas of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_research">operation research</A>, which might, for example help you optimize your diet, investment, daily schedule, etc. In other words, <B>you cannot be guided by just the fun of learning but by your goals and needs</B>.

Hard study material can still provide instant gratification. </P>
<P>While you focus on your goals, you cannot forget about the overall context of human life. You cannot dig solely into studying car engines only because this happens to be your profession. This would put you at risk of developing a tunnel vision. You might spend years improving a liquid fuel engine efficiency while others would leap years by getting involved in lithium batteries or hydrogen engines. One of the main reasons for which companies go bankrupt is that their leadership fails to spot the change. As corporate darwinism eliminates short-sighted teams, future society will witness more and more intellectual darwinism. To understand the trends and the future, you need to study human nature, economics, sociology, history, neurophysiology, mathematics, computing sciences, and more.

<P>Should we learn "trivia" such as "<I>Which year was the Internet born?</I>". <B>The concept of trivia is highly relative!</B> To a child in a kindergarten, the birth of the Internet is rather meaningless. At this stage of development, the child may find it difficult to grasp the concept of the Internet itself. Many parents will wait until the primary school before showing a web browser to their child. The value of putting the date on the birth of the Internet probably develops only in the context of an effort to understand the history of technological development. In this context, 1969 may be as important as the name of <A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm#Johannes%20Gutenberg">Gutenberg</A>. Only when multiple events of the 1960s and the 1970s dovetail together, the commissioning of ARPANET becomes meaningful. When we figure out that we landed the man on the moon before making the first connection via the net, 1969 looms larger. If we dig deeper, we may find it inspiring to know that when Charley Kline tried to log in on October 29, 1969, the network crashed as he typed the letter <I>G</I>. Imagine, you work on commissioning a major installation that you have worked on for several years. You know that the installation implements revolutionary concepts yet it keeps on crashing. You are about to lose heart. This may not necessarily be an emotional event, after all you also need to apply probability to deciding when to give up blind-alley pursuits even after years of investment. The juxtaposition of the small letter <I>G</I> and the groundbreaking concept of the interconnected world will help you see the big picture. If your concept is great enough, you will go on through another 100 crashes in hope of diagnosing the reason. That perseverance may seem to have little to do with "being smart", but it will make you into a winner (given a bit of luck). </P>
<P>Listen to other people's advice and valuations. The younger you are the more you should listen. In the end though, <B>it must be you who determines the criteria for sifting golden knowledge from trivia</B>. Only you can measure the value of knowledge in the light of your own goals. </P>
<P>Remember that not all knowledge can easily be formulated in a declarative manner. Remember then to use the power of your own neural networks: solve problems, practice your skills, compute, abstract, associate, etc. You and others may not be able to see or verbalize some rules but your brain will extract them in the course of practice. Once the rules have been developed, try to formulate them and write them down. This can be of benefit to you and others. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Knowledge_that_assists_problem_solving class=mw-headline>Knowledge that assists problem solving</SPAN></H3>
<P>Problem solving in artificial intelligence can be used to mimic those mental faculties of a human being that we associate with intelligence and creativity. There are many approaches to problem solving such as deduction, induction, abduction, reasoning by analogy or probabilistic methods, neural networks approach, searching in state space, and more. And even though some of these can generate false conclusions or uncertain responses, they can all be expressed by means of deductive methods such as those used in theorem proving in mathematics. Deduction proceeds from axioms or premises towards true formulas or assertions through logical derivation using valid inference rules. The better the selection of assertions and the selection of inference rules, the broader the reasoning capacity of an expert system or human brain. Rich inferential knowledge stored in our memory makes us fast in thinking, creative, intelligent, efficient in problem solving, etc. Yet we need factual knowledge as the raw processing material for derivation. Even the creative vein and inspiration can be expressed in terms of multithreaded derivation and backtracking well formalized in logic programming. No magic fluids or reflections of the soul are involved here. Just a plain network of firing neurons recovering the encoded patterns of facts and rules. See also: <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">Roots of creativity and genius</A>. </P>
<P>To boost your problem solving capacity you need to master a great deal of inferential knowledge. If you learn about specific classes of problems to solve, you may need to choose between memorizing the outcome of inference or its individual steps. Both equip you with a formula for transforming knowledge into new quality. Learning derivation steps is costly. At the same time it can equip you with highly abstract derivation rules. You need to balance cost and benefit. We cannot blindly assume that it is better to derive answers to problems than to simply memorize the answers. In problems with multiple instances, we will tend to learn the derivation. For example, it is easier to learn how to derive the third power of X than to memorize all useful pairs: argument-result. On the other hand, most of people memorize the multiplication table at the time when they could still derive the result from bit-operations on binary numbers. Memorizing some 40 or so combinations seems more practicable, esp. that derivation always takes time and we make use of the multiplication table thousands of times in a lifetime. Here memorization saves hours and days in the lifetime perspective. Brain armed with rich factual and inferential knowledge will associate the most remote ideas and derive the most unexpected conclusions. Through a conscious control over this rich reasoning process, we have built the present civilization. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Knowledge_that_assists_creativity class=mw-headline>Knowledge that assists creativity</SPAN></H3>
<P>Creativity is based on association of ideas. It is helpful to be born with a creative brain that keeps spewing new ideas in all circumstances. However, creativity can also be assisted. When you master a great deal of facts and rules in areas adjacent to the problem that you try to creatively solve or elaborate upon, your creativity gets enhanced. If you employ incremental learning, the association of random ideas will be a norm throughout the process. </P>
<P>All innovation in the history of science and technology is based on association. Forgetful memory can be helped with external sources of knowledge and each major scientific breakthrough is based on a series of smaller steps, many of which will be based on hours of search, trial-and-error and experimentation. The brain armed with extensive knowledge is more likely to come up with the needed associations. As in problem solving, inferential knowledge is also particularly valuable in creative efforts. The rules that you know, help you derive new truths, and associate these with all your current knowledge. </P>

The history of the mankind is made of billions of individual lives that keep on sparking and fading. Born of self-preservation instincts imprinted by evolution, history books paint a picture of a constant string of wars, conflict of interest, loss and gain of influences, lust for power and submission to weaknesses of human nature. On the other hand, the greatest achievement of the evolution, the rational mind, kept on contributing to new findings, discoveries, technologies and philosophies. Progress has always hinged on discovering new truths and preserving them for posterity in form of stories, solutions, tools, books, and other carriers of information. Knowledge is the basis of human power, yet it constantly struggles with two forces that regularly diminish it: death and forgetting. We can preserve knowledge in books and other forms of information storage. However, this knowledge translates to value only then when it is used by the creative power of the human brain. The limitations of the human brain will remain a bottleneck of progress for many years to come. We will develop artificially intelligent knowledge processors not earlier than in a decade or two. </P>

As yet, there is no efficient remedy to the death of knowledge. All we can do is to attach more weight to healthy lifestyle and health research.

Artificial intelligence can also eliminate the problem of forgetting (at least within the bounds of the available storage). Some forgetting is needed to shape crisp associative knowledge, but that is a welcome phenomenon that leads to more applicable knowledge. Despite great hopes we might have about artificial intelligence, the best path towards immortal knowledge must still rely today on the use of the human brain.

<H2><SPAN id=Knowledge_acquisition:_Areas_of_optimization class=mw-headline>Knowledge acquisition: Areas of optimization</SPAN></H2>
<P>There are seven main areas where the learning process can be enhanced. Incremental learning plays a role in each, however, the first two areas will benefit only through your growing experience, and ability to quantify your progress: </P>
<OL>
<LI><B>access to knowledge</B>: with the advent of the world wide web, we all have information literally at our fingertips. Searching for knowledge with <A class="external text" href="http://google.com">Google</A> is fast, easy and accurate. <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> is the biggest encyclopedia in human history. Access to knowledge is no longer a bottleneck of human learning. It virtually became a non issue! Web's quality and role will continue increasing exponentially as more and more people appreciate its potential and contribute to its growth. There are still many complementary sources of information that compete successfully with the Internet. However, it is only a question of time before you will be safely able to rely on the Internet as your sole source of information. The great benefit of reading the web, as opposed to reading the books, is that the hypertext nature of the web enforces a very compact and usually self-explaining nature of individual articles. A jump to a randomly selected page in an average book will leave you confused due to the context-dependence of the material. On the other hand, it is less likely the same confusion will trouble you in a random jump to a selected page of an equivalent material placed on the web. Web authors usually put more effort to add contexts to the page (at least in the form of hyperlinks). In other words, it is easier to build quality knowledge by reading single pages of the web than by reading single pages of paper books. We are getting closer to the ideals of incremental life-long learning as opposed to thorough-review learning which for many ends with the end of school years. In the busy days of modern society, few can afford a thorough review of their rusty knowledge in individual fields. It is much easier to fix the gaps incrementally: today an article on the structure of the atom, tomorrow an article on a healthy diet, etc. And all that strictly adjusted to individual's interests and professional priorities 
<LI><B>selecting knowledge</B>: you will face the need to fill the gaps in your knowledge in many more areas than your time permits or your memory makes possible. You can ask SuperMemo to help you scrupulously note down and prioritize all areas of knowledge that need an enhancement! In SuperMemo, you are the master of what you learn and what you neglect. Your ability to select valuable information will grow in proportion to the acquired knowledge. Incremental learning helps you quantify your knowledge and extrapolate into the future. This will help you be more selective in choosing your learning materials. 
<LI><B>reading</B>: this is the first stage where knowledge makes an actual intimate contact with the brain. Traditionally, it is streamed into memory in a more or less linear manner (i.e. paragraph after paragraph).

<P>Each piece of knowledge stored in SuperMemo adds to the total cost of learning in terms of time. If knowledge is <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">well-formulated</A>, we can estimate that a single element will be repeated from 8-20 times in a lifetime. If a single repetition time falls in the range from 3 seconds to 15 seconds, we could conclude that the expected lifetime cost of a single item ranges from 24 seconds to 5 minutes. SuperMemo has a statistical measure called <B><A title=Statistics href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Statistics#Cost">Cost</A></B>. It measures the total time cost of a single memorized element. In a well-managed long-term learning process, this cost is usually estimated at 2-3 minutes/item in a 10-year bracket. This is then more than the theoretical prediction due to the fact that each collection contains a small subset of so-called <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Leech" data-hasqtip="742" oldtitle="Glossary:Leech">leeches</A> which dramatically increase the average cost/item (note that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Leech" data-hasqtip="743" oldtitle="Glossary:Leech">leeches</A> can easily be <A title=Leeches href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Leeches">detected and removed</A> from the learning process). The rational criterion for deciding if a piece of knowledge should be memorized by means of SuperMemo is to judge the benefits of having the given piece constantly available in memory. If the benefits do not seem to add up to more than 10 minutes, the student might simply not add an item to SuperMemo.

Only <B>you</B> can accurately guess the value. For example, the value of memorizing the opening hours of your gym in a given time might be approximated by multiplying (1) the probability you will choose wrong hours by (2) the time-cost of missing the gym. For example, if you believe that the probability is 25% and the cost of choosing wrong hours is 40 minutes, the cost of knowing the opening hours is around 10 minutes. In such a case, memorizing the opening hours will be cheaper than missing the gym. However, if the probability is sufficiently low or the time loss sufficiently small, you should not add opening hours to SuperMemo. For example, if the probability is 10% and time loss is 3 minutes, you are not likely to recover your learning investment! There are naturally less clear-cut cases in-between.

With the advent of the web, <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>, blogosphere, and other sources of knowledge, access to information is easier than ever.

<P><I>I believe that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="761" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A> (IR) may slow down or hamper learning complex subjects that require deeper understanding -- as opposed to superficial remembering. From what I'm told, in IR, the student spends but a few seconds on a passage related to one subject, and then jumps to another, completely unrelated subject. Such switching among disparate subjects makes it difficult, if not impossible, to engage in deeper thoughts and thus to discover deeper truths beyond the superficial remembering of passages. When I read, I look for concepts and methods that underlie the necessarily descriptive language used to convey them, and I try to imagine their applicability in my other pursuits. In other words, discovering deeper truths requires deeper thoughts. The latter are difficult to reach if only a few seconds are spent on a subject at a time. As a practical aside, technical papers in hard sciences and engineering are peppered with notational inconsistencies among different authors, different research groups, and different journals. The same symbols may mean different things in different scientific papers. Similarly, different authors may use different symbols to denote the same quantity. Sometimes the differences are gross and easy to spot, and sometimes they are only subtle. When reading one paper at a time, the reader familiarizes him/herself with the terminology and notation, and can follow the line of reasoning while recognizing the subtleties. Having a few dozen (or hundreds!) articles read in parallel, frequently switching among them, creates a nightmare scenario of confusion where the meaning is lost in the jungle of various notations and subtle terminology differences. This makes it impossible to follow the line of reasoning in any one of the papers. Below are a couple of (imperfect) metaphors that may convey the sense of loss when trying to apply IR to learning complex subjects and to discovering deeper truths:</I> </P>

<LI><I>If you are a wine connoisseur, imagine that you are only allowed to smell the wine, but that you are not allowed to drink it, or even to put it in your mouth. How good would your knowledge of wine be? With practice, you would probably learn to distinguish various wineries, age, etc. You may even be more efficient at it, and be able to do it in record time. Yet, I venture a guess that you would feel something missing, that you would feel somehow cheated, that you would feel that you don't know all that there is to know about wine. And rightfully so. Same with IR. You just 'smell' the knowledge, but you never 'taste' it. It may be enough if your goal is to learn a foreign language. But some areas require that you dig deeper if you want the real insight, the real truth.</I> 
<LI><I>Physical exercise. A well-rounded routine has both cardiovascular and resistance training elements to it. IR is like having only the high-intensity cardio. Sure, if you stick with cardio, after a while you will be able to deliver a small package across town in record time -- and that may be all you aspire to. However, it will not give you the upper body strength to help move a 400-kg optics bench. Same with IR: you may impress your audience with the breadth of your knowledge, but you will have to leave the heavy intellectual lifting to others.</I></LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="763" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">Incremental reading</A> is all you want it to be. It can be speed-reading, cram-reading, or mass-reading. It all depends on the priority criteria which you choose. For that reasons, it would be best described as a reading management technique. As such it is indispensable independent of the complexity of the studied matter. On one hand, you can speed-read articles faster than in conventional speed-reading and yet leave vital paragraphs for future review. On the other hand, you can meticulously dismantle individual paragraphs and convert them into classical questions-answers material that will stay with you for ever. In addition, you can freely manipulate the volume of the material flowing into the reading/learning process. You can focus on a hundred most important articles or you can opt for thousands. Naturally, in the latter case, your time allocation for individual articles will be minute. For example, if you import 10,000 articles to SuperMemo, you might end up with 50,000 to 100,000 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="764" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extracts</A> within a year of 1-hour daily reading.

<P><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="766" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">Incremental reading</A> is universal in textbook learning. Whatever complex concepts you need to analyze, and whatever computations you need to make on the margins, you can do in parallel with incremental reading of the textbook (assuming you have an electronic version). An old rule says: whatever you need to remember for life (or at least months), process incrementally (to improve memory, boost understanding, and save time in the long term). Whatever you need at the moment, for the sake of understanding the subject, process in bulk (non-incrementally). By combining the two, you can get the most of your learning. </P>

<P style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,255)"><I>The Earth is moving very very slowly away from the Sun. This happens for two reasons. The first is that the Sun is constantly losing mass because of the solar wind. As the mass of the Sun decreases its pull on the Earth decreases and so the Earth moves slightly further away. The second reason is to do with tidal forces. In exactly the same way that the Moon is slowly moving away from the Earth, the Earth is very slowly moving away from the Sun. In the Earth-Moon case the Moon pulls on the Earth creating tides and slowing the Earth&#8217;s rotation very slightly, making the day longer. This action has a reaction - the Moon's orbit is speeded up. If something travels faster it must move outwards to remain in an orbit and so the Moon slowly drifts away from us at a rate of 3.8 centimeters per year. The same situation happens with the Sun but the Earth&#8217;s influence on the Sun is much smaller than the Moon&#8217;s influence on the Earth.

<P>Nobody loves SuperMemo as of the first day. It may take a few weeks to notice its power.

<P>The paradoxical tendency of "gulpers" to become good incremental readers comes from their hunger for knowledge.

<P>The existence of the memory bottleneck is the direct consequence of the overload concern. You can overload your learning process with excess information, however, you are unlikely to "overload your long-term memory". The processes of forgetting and garbage collection executed in sleep have evolved precisely to prevent this problem. However much you try to learn excess facts, forgetting will clean up the excess, and memory optimization in sleep will ensure you develop all necessary "meaningful connections".

<P>That skepticism is understandable, and yet we stick with the original claim: you can indeed read thousands of articles at the same time.

In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="824" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>, only one article receives a laser focus at any given moment of time.

<P>To understand <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="825" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>, you need to understand SuperMemo (or <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Repetition_spacing" data-hasqtip="826" oldtitle="Glossary:Repetition spacing">repetition spacing</A> in general), as well as the effects of intermittent reading on memory.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>In addition to the behavioral and physiological criteria already mentioned, subjective experience (in the case of the self) and verbal reports of such experience (in the case of others) are used at the human level to define sleep. Upon being alerted, one may feel or say, "I was asleep just then," and such judgments ordinarily are accepted as evidence for identifying a prearousal state as sleep. Such subjective evidence, however, can be at variance with both behavioral classifications and sleep electrophysiology, raising interesting questions about how to define the true measure of sleep. Is sleep determined by objective or subjective evidence alone, or is it determined by some combination of the two? And what is the best way to measure such evidence? More generally, problems in defining sleep arise when evidence for one or more of the several criteria of sleep is lacking or when the evidence generated by available criteria is inconsistent. Do all animals sleep?</I> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Donald Rumsfeld claims to live by the rule: "<I>First reports are always wrong</I>". </P>
<P>News carries knowledge that is usually valid in a short term only. Incremental learning is useful only for long-term memories. The greatest benefits of trying to process news with incremental learning is to realize how transient news is, and to moderate the craving for news by making it "old news" through the incremental approach. </P>
<P>These are the main reasons why news is a poor candidate for your learning material: </P>
<UL>
<LI>knowledge that comes with the news is incomplete. If you hear "breaking news", you know this is about news that is "broken". It is incomplete and inaccurate. If you ever think of retaining it in your memory for long, come back to <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> in a week, or in a month, or in a few years. The news becomes most useful when it becomes history. Most of the time, however, it all gets forgotten by the next "news cycle" 
<LI>knowledge that comes with the news is contradictory. If you happen to incrementally juxtapose news with old news, you will realize the extent to which people change their minds as new information becomes available. That evolution in thinking and opinion is probably the most interesting part of news. 
<LI>knowledge that comes with the news is scant. What was news yesterday might still be news today with some tiny change in the angle. News is repetitive and monopolized by single "hot" issue. If you watch news once a week, you will rarely miss anything important for your long-term perspective 
<LI>knowledge that comes with the news is trivial. Breaking news might be devoted entirely to a plane crash, or a bomb explosion. Unless you or your close ones are directly affected, you hardly ever become a better person by being intimate with the details of the tragedy. Understanding plane crashes or bomb explosions in general is far more relevant. A National Geographic documentary might be a better source of such knowledge. Unless this is your first ever encounter with crashes and bombs, you rarely learn anything of major significance. Your ability to change the world will better be enhanced with other sources of knowledge. Your optimization in this area will also help build a future with fewer bombs and fewer crashes.</LI></UL>
<P>News may have more value for you at younger ages when you still need to learn a lot about the world, or when you are trying to learn a new language and want to understand the news broadcast from another country. In such cases, use news mostly as the source of indications of what supplementary material should enter your learning process for you to comprehend the news better. </P>
<P>Unless you study journalism (and need to understand the process), or political sciences (incl. the impact of news on the public), or you just live and die by being up-to-date, you should limit your craving for news and focus on knowledge with long-term applicability. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Example:_how_breaking_news_breaks_the_news class=mw-headline>Example: how breaking news breaks the news</SPAN></H3>
<P>Consider this funny episode from CNN that illustrates the obsession with "breaking news". On a sunny Sunday of September 22, 2013, Fareed Zakaria spoke about Angela's Merkel impact on Germany, and Europe: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Merkel has taken important steps to help Europe's struggling economies, spending tens of billions of dollars directly and indirectly on them. On the other hand, Merkel has imposed austerity on much of Europe, which has been excessive and counterproductive. Her argument is that it is the only way to get governments like Greece and Italy to become more competitive. Now here's the irony...</I> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now here is a real irony. The intelligent commentary was interrupted by the breaking news related to Angela Merkel herself. The viewer did not get a chance to learn about the historic role of the German leader. Instead he or she got a 2 min. "deal" to watch Angela Merkel vote in a federal election. Three full minutes of relaxing silence and a chance to admire Angela's dress and body language in this historic moment. </P>
<P>Ah yes, if you cannot stand similar interruptions and want to learn about the historic role of Angela, see Zakaria's transcripts at <A class="external text" href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1309/22/fzgps.01.html">FAREED ZAKARIA GPS: Not the Time for Big Sticks; Interview with Bill Clinton; Will Germany's Merkel Practice What She Preaches?</A> </P><SPLIT1>

<P><B>Question</B>: What was decided at the Council of Trent, beginning in 1545, and how long did the Council go on?<BR><B>Answer</B>: The basic beliefs of the Catholic Church; 18 years. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Two separate memories should be separated in SuperMemo due to the fact that they nearly always will require different timing of repetitions. If you can always activate the same mental pathway in thinking about the Council of Trent ("neurons firing together" in the same pattern), your particular <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="851" oldtitle="Glossary:Item">item</A> has a good chance of surviving long in the process without a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Lapse" data-hasqtip="852" oldtitle="Glossary:Lapse">memory lapse</A>. However, once you build a large database of similar <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="853" oldtitle="Glossary:Item">items</A>, and you review your sizeable material under the pressure of time, your review will always tend to strip redundant pieces of information. Overtime, your nice <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="854" oldtitle="Glossary:Item">item</A> will be reduced to the bare bones of information that will often fail its primary test: applicability in real life. It may happen, that despite zero <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Lapse" data-hasqtip="855" oldtitle="Glossary:Lapse">memory lapses</A>, in 2-3 years, someone will ask you about a Council of Trent in a new context and you will be amazed that you won't be able to reasonably answer the question despite having all the necessary pieces of information included in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="856" oldtitle="Glossary:Item">item</A>. Two memories of different difficulty might be compared to two different planes of different flying characteristics. The difficult piece (e.g. 18 year duration of the Council) might be compared to a slow flying plane. The easy piece (here the reference to the Catholic Church) might be compared to a modern jet. Review of the conglomerated <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="857" oldtitle="Glossary:Item">item</A> might be compared to flying both planes at the same speed. In an extreme case, this might be impossible. The compromise speed might be too high for a slow plane, which might disintegrate beyond a certain speed limit, while the faster plane cannot slow down enough without stalling. In our memory, forgetting is equivalent to forgetting, while stalling is caused by the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" data-hasqtip="858" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect">spacing effect</A>. By doing complex and repeatable reasoning at each repetition, you might act as if handling both planes using remote control. However, this is always difficult and requires lots of focus and deliberation at repetitions. Your brain has natural defenses against such "enforced repetitive reasoning". It is designed to be "intellectually lazy" and thus energetically efficient. Practice shows that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="859" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A> produces many more <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="860" oldtitle="Glossary:Item">items</A>. However, those <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="861" oldtitle="Glossary:Item">items</A> are usually much easier to remember. In the end, you spend less time on reviewing 5-10 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="862" oldtitle="Glossary:Item">items</A> than you would spend on an item that would conglomerate information and suffer repeated <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Lapse" data-hasqtip="863" oldtitle="Glossary:Lapse">memory lapses</A> or very short <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="864" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval">intervals</A>. </P>
<P>In the course of the evolution, the brain developed strategies for abstracting away from the details and retaining only the most essential, useful and frequently used information. Those strategies are great for survival, but aren't as good in reaching our educational goals. Council of Trent is a typical example of knowledge we wish to have, but that is pretty expensive. This is because, for most people, it does not get reinforced in run-of-the-mill conversations, TV shows, daily applicability, or at water cooler at work. The situation might differ if you, in particular, read a lot on the subject matter. This might help the memory establish itself in an efficient manner. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="865" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">Incremental reading</A> makes it possible to root such difficult-to-retain knowledge firmly in the context, and still make sure that individual repetitions focus on a very specific and cheap-to-retain memories. </P>

If your <A class="external text" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_index_in_SuperMemo#default_forgetting_index">default forgetting index</A> is 10%, this translates to a span from 70% chance of retaining the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="873" oldtitle="Glossary:Item">item</A> to the totally unacceptable 90% chance of forgetting!

<P><I>Incremental reading is a fairly misunderstood feature of SuperMemo. Incremental reading entails importing your reading material into a flashcard. This can be a huge Wikipedia article for instance, or an entire eBook. Whilst reading, if you encounter a word you&#8217;re unfamiliar with, you can highlight the sentence or paragraph it sits in and make it into an entirely new flashcard automatically, ready for you to review later on. By highlighting, pressing Alt+X to extract the segment &#8211; you will see the section become blue, meaning this part has been extracted to another flashcard. [...] Incremental refers to reading the content in small chunks over time, until you&#8217;ve read all the material and extracted the information you want from it. You can mark where you&#8217;ve reached in the reading material up to using the &#8216;set the read point&#8217; tool on the Read toolbar, so next time you see the article/chapter/whatever, SuperMemo will display it visibly instead of you scrolling down. [...] Once you&#8217;ve finished reading the flashcard, and extracted all of the juicy goodness from it, you can delete it using Shift-Ctrl-Enter. This command is different to pure delete, because it will retain all of the flashcards you created from it, whereas delete will cause you to lose these. Which would be a pain in the derriere. SuperMemo, using it&#8217;s super-duper algorithm, will schedule the review of these items for you. [...] Incremental reading represents a powerful chimera of extensive and intensive reading. And this can be used with anything &#8211; news stories, blog posts, Wikipedia articles.</I> </P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Here is an exemplary opinion of a user of SuperMemo who understands incremental reading, and still has many reservations: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-comment">
<P><I>I have been using SuperMemo for 19 years now (with occasional breaks). I understand the concept of incremental reading pretty well. I read about it a lot. Many times I thought of trying it. However, I am still not convinced that I should embark on this journey. Please see my story. I will gladly hear your opinion. Am I mistaken or am I different, you think? Or is the incremental reading picture a bit too rosy?</I> </P>
<P><B>Learned read-only mentality</B> </P>
<P><I>I started making repetitions years back with a goal to improving my English. To do that, I relied on learning with a ready-made Advanced English collection containing 40,000+ words and phrases. The learning material was comprehensive (far exceeding my needs), and the default learning process efficient enough to quickly propel me into good command of the language. Encouraged by the results I kept exploring the program but rarely took advantage of the ever-expanding gamut of SuperMemo's new advanced options. It seemed as if I hadn't really needed them to get the results I wanted (at least in the English language department). All I did was make outstanding repetitions, memorize my daily quota of new words and phrases, and, occasionally, add a piece of vocabulary or grammar which wasn&#8217;t originally in the collection.</I> </P>
<P><B>Incompatibility of my profession with incremental approach</B> </P>
<P><I>As for my other learning needs, they start with my professional life which happens to be computer programming. And it seems like an area of knowledge which is not particularly well-suited for declarative learning. Furthermore, Dr Wozniak himself admits learning materials for programming are not suitable for processing with incremental reading. In other words, I seem to be unable to realize the promise of incremental reading in my life&#8217;s vocation thus leaving me less determined to explore it for other domains.</I> </P>
<P><B>Stress factor</B> </P>
<P><I>I believe that I have achieved a pretty good mastery of SuperMemo over the years. It does not mean though that SuperMemo still isn&#8217;t able to throw a curve ball every now and then. Take the <B>Spread priorities</B> feature for instance. When I first checked it, I was greeted with </I>0!!!<I> against the yellow background in one of the fields: <B>Step</B>. I tried to change the value but no matter what I did I kept coming back to square one. As it turned out, it was SuperMemo&#8217;s way of telling me there aren&#8217;t enough priority positions for the subset I selected. SuperMemo may lack in the implementation department, even though it tries to address this, many times, at great length, in the documentation. In other words, with enough persistence you can find your way around the program. This journey of discovery may be stressful but nowhere near as much as the whole idea of incremental reading if you give it a careful thought. In fact, the more I read about it (at an attempt to dispel my doubts), the more stressful it becomes. Particularly, the entire prioritization stage seems overwhelming (to the point of nausea). The advantages you so diligently describe may all be true (although some are far from obvious and/or instant). Most of those advantage will hold only as long as you set the priorities right. But the entire process seems like a wild goose chase to me (not only because the priority queue is relative in its design). It would be interesting to know how much the student actually spends on priorities in the course of a daily learning session. For example, take a priority scale. In its relative variation (i.e. when expressed as percentage), it ranges from 1 to 100 which is simply too wide (the creators of the ABC analysis recognized that long time ago). I remember reading somewhere SuperMemo novices find it hard to grade yourself on the 6-piece scale. This now seems like a breeze as compared with giving a priority to a piece of knowledge. I understand the intention for more granular control but it is simply mind-boggling. To make matters worse, there are a number of processes (both manual/conscious and (semi-)automatic/unconscious) that erode your painstakingly set priority hierarchy. I do not mind when it actually changes but what if I accidentally stumble against an item whose priority I set as important, it still remains important, but somehow ended up in the later stages of the priority queue (and, from all what I have read, it is more than a remote possibility). When I read the article, I am often reminded of the following quote by Margaret Thatcher: "</I>I do not know anyone who has got to the top without hard work. That is the recipe. It will not always get you to the top, but should get you pretty near.<I>" It holds a great promise but it is far from guarantee. I believe, I recognize really well how complex incremental reading actually is, and having that clearly in mind, I conclude your advantages section offers even less in the form of guarantee. You can invest a whole lot of time, and in the end SuperMemo will only make you realize how dismal you are at managing it all (because, make no mistake, </I>you<I> need to carefully manage it). The toolset may be rich but is it natural? Furthermore, it all depends on the correct input. Your advantages include <A title="Incremental reading" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading#Uniform_progress">uniform progress</A>. Yeah, right. Developing tunnel vision when you import and process a large number of articles related to a single topic is as much if not (considering our human deficiencies) more likely.</I> </P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

You might just be one of those who excel at theory and fail in practical situations for a number of reasons. You should definitely give incremental learning a try and see how it works. If frustrations keep multiplying beyond the first two months of use, your chances may drop. It is vital to start from simplest concepts: import, extract and cloze. All the remaining tools should wait for their turn until you start enjoying the process. For the same reason, you should start from learning about things you love (not about algebra or economics). Your hobby, your pet, your favorite sport, health, your favorite music band, your favorite actor or actress, etc. Use <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> as its texts are well-suited for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="967" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>.

<P>Short comments on the rest of your text: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>tunnel vision</B>: experience shows that incremental learning favors broad learning as opposed to developing a tunnel vision. After all, the more you know, the more you know you do not know. You are more likely to have your day monopolized by a single topic when you do traditional reading or browsing. In incremental learning you face the whole spectrum of your knowledge (with a natural bias towards your interests). Unpredictability of incremental learning sequences, also in different moods or different contexts (e.g. change of interest), increases the quality of the creative processes. This is where curiosity is born. You are more likely to become interested with a seemingly irrelevant detail when you have a peaceful time allocation typical of incremental learning. This is how you keep branching to new areas. This branching is less likely when you work in conditions of stress, time constraints, and information overload, typical to free browsing on the net. In free browsing, you can open 20 browser tabs and struggle with the right course of action: read now, make favorite, save to disk, skim, give up, etc. In incremental learning, you just import all tabs, and return to your main line of thought. Naturally, it helps greatly if you prioritize the tabs. This is a way of consolidating new interests as opposed to giving them just a temporary brush. SuperMemo's capacity to prevent tunnel vision is mentioned amongst its advantages. See: <B><A title="Incremental reading" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading#Advantages_of_incremental_reading">Advantages of incremental learning</A>: Uniform progress</B> 
<LI><B>wild goose chase</B>: the way shifting <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="968" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority">priorities</A> work in SuperMemo is exactly how priorities behave in real life situations: your yesterday's interests are ruthlessly replaced by today's interests, and so on. This is a wild goose chase indeed. But the fault is not with SuperMemo, but with human nature. Please recall that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="969" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A> started from <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Reading_list" data-hasqtip="970" oldtitle="Glossary:Reading list">reading lists</A>. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_bias" data-hasqtip="971" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority bias">Priority bias</A> could result in having a thousand or ten thousand top priority articles. This situation was not manageable and not rational. With relative <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="972" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority">priorities</A> you can observe the process, and work to improve your strategies, and your personal honesty about priorities. This will not stop the wild goose chase, but you have a range of tools to correct your mistakes (e.g. when discovering a neglected portion of the material). However long you think about it, you are not likely to find a better remedy to your knowledge greed than a simple <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" data-hasqtip="973" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue">priority queue</A>! You have signaled the problem, but you neglect the fact that in real life, the problem is incomparably greater. In SuperMemo, if you discover neglected material, you can up-prioritize it. In traditional learning, you forget the material and the problem itself. It is better to chase the goose that to have it swept under the carpet. 
<LI><B>stress</B>: if the prioritization process is stressful, you can initially ignore the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" data-hasqtip="974" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue">priority queue</A>. You will needed it only when your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="975" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A> grows beyond a manageable size. You can then gradually introduce various prioritization levels. For example, you can have a shy start with just two levels: <I><B>Important: 22%</B></I> and <I><B>Unimportant: 88%</B></I>. You will soon discover that you need more precision, esp. that you will never escape the feeling "<I>this article must land in top 3 articles</I>", which at some point may mean you need decimal places or referencing the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" data-hasqtip="976" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue">priority queue</A> by position. 
<LI><B>user friendliness</B>: the problem of <B>Step</B> in <B><A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations#spread_priorities">Spread priorities</A></B> is typical of SuperMemo, which claims to be unfriendly for novices to better satisfy the pros. This option might display a message: "<I>You are trying to squeeze more <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="977" oldtitle="Glossary:Element">elements</A> into the range than the size of the range</I>". However, this would make pros apoplectic, as it is very easy to input wrong data. You do not want to waste time on clicking away the message. A pro will just want to correct the input. This problem cannot be remedied by <B><A title="File menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File_menu">File</A>&nbsp;: <A title="File menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File_menu#Level">Level</A></B> because <B><A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations#spread_priorities">Spread priorities</A></B> is available only at advanced levels. This means that the user should already be inured to the fact that the first use of any function in SuperMemo may be difficult. A more sophisticated solution, e.g. a wizard or messages incorporated in the dialog, would probably not pass <CODE>Value/Time</CODE> criterion on the ever-bloating SuperMemo tasklist. You are right, SuperMemo is not nice for novices. If you have simpler solution ideas, please mail them. They are always read carefully.

<H2><SPAN id=What_is_incremental_video.3F></SPAN><SPAN id=What_is_incremental_video? class=mw-headline>What is incremental video?</SPAN></H2>
<P>Incremental video is a technique for learning or watching video recordings with the view to forming lasting memories of the material viewed. Incremental video makes it possible to learn from multiple sources of video without neglecting any one of them. The processing of individual sources proceeds in parallel and time allocations for individual sources depend on student's priorities. Incremental video is to video as <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="1367" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A> is to learning from electronic texts. In incremental video, it is the user who decides which portions of a video are important to remember. Those portions are part of a standard learning process known from other applications of SuperMemo. Each portion of the video forms a separate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1368" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic">topic</A> that is reviewed at increasing <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1369" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval">intervals</A>. Despite working with thousands of videos, you do not ever need to feel lost, ever get bored, or ever miss a valuable scene. You can also use SuperMemo as your video or music jukebox. You can work with individual videos for mere seconds. Just as much as is needed to set the new viewing point, determine the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1370" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority">priority</A> and determine the date of the next viewing. This way, you can process dozens of videos daily and work with thousands of videos in parallel. You shall feel overwhelmed with the richness of <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> never again! </P>
<P>On the face of it, incremental video looks like channel-zapping on steroids. However, it is also a powerful learning technique that makes it easy to process thousands of videos in parallel without getting lost. It also makes it easy to learn individual video scenes for long-term <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1371" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention">retention</A>. It can be used to learn sports, master musical instruments, understand biology, or learn fun dialogs in your favorite movies. Individual videos are processed in small portions. Viewing can be resumed at any time at the last viewing position. Best pieces are preserved for repeat viewing. Individual videos are prioritized and served on a daily basis in manageable portions in order of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1372" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority">priority</A>. </P>
<P>Although, incremental video can roughly be implemented with a pair of digital video recorders working in tandem, only SuperMemo provides a bona fide implementation with the whole set of incremental learning tools. SuperMemo makes it possible to learn from standard video files (e.g. MP4). It also makes it easy to learn from <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> videos. At the moment of writing these words, no other software in the world provides the incremental video learning toolset. </P>

<P>Incremental video in SuperMemo can use <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> videos. You can capitalize on the video streaming power of <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> and speed up SuperMemo even though you may suffer video lags on weaker Internet connections. You will also dramatically save on hard disk space. Videos are notorious hogs of space, your <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1373" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collections</A> will take a tiny fraction of space needed for video based on local files. <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1374" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A> will actually take less space than <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="1375" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A> <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1376" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collections</A> while carrying lots of learning power. If your network is slow or frequently down, you should take comfort in the fact that this situation is likely to change for the better as networks improve worldwide all the time (and this progress is not likely to be slowed soon). Last but not least, SuperMemo will hopefully encourage you to upload your own educational videos to <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> and thus share them with others. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Incremental_video_with_video_files class=mw-headline>Incremental video with video files</SPAN></H3>
<P>Incremental video in SuperMemo can use video files from your local drive. You do not need to limit your learning to videos available from <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> that can be notoriously volatile (e.g. with accounts closed for copyright violations, embedding blocked by account holders, videos made private, etc.). You are not limited by the need to access the Internet. You can also process private videos. </P>
<P>Using incremental video with local files requires computers with significant processing power. On a strong PC, processing video files is fast and painless. It may be slower on weaker PCs. Your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1377" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collections</A> may grow to be terabytes large, which is the main disadvantage of keeping files local. Make sure you have a big dedicated external drive for a backup of your material. The time-scale resolution of local videos is higher than that of <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A>-based videos, which are limited to setting <B>Start</B> and <B>Stop</B> points in increments of 1 second. With local files, you can review fragments that last milliseconds. You can review your best football move at nauseam. Moreover, with local files, you can work when disconnected from the net. </P>
<P>Incremental video can use local files in several video formats (incl. MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, Mpeg, and more). Not all video formats are supported. Before you commit to SuperMemo, give it a try to see if your files can be processed or converted to acceptable format with third party tools. </P><SPLIT1>

<P>SuperMemo is a pioneer of <B>incremental video</B>. For those who are familiar with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="1378" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>, incremental video is an analogous technique. Instead of text <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1379" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extracts</A>, you generate <A title=Extract href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Extract">video extracts</A>, i.e. portions of a larger video. Video <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1380" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extracts</A> are viewed repeatedly in increasing <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1381" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval">intervals</A> (as it is the case with other pieces of information in SuperMemo). </P>
<P>Individual videos and their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1382" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extracts</A> are treated in the same way as all other <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1383" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic">topic elements</A> and enter the learning process according to the rules that are known from <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="1384" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>.

<P>Here are some problems you may encounter when learning with <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A>-based incremental video: </P>
<UL>
<LI><A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> videos can be removed at any time. They can also have embedding disabled. This is a major problem for the present implementation of YouTube-based incremental video in SuperMemo. There are no API tools that could allow of legal localization of YouTube contents (at the moment of writing). However, the problem mostly affects copyrighted material that shows up on <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> illegally (e.g. movies, music, etc.). Occasionally, video authors themselves remove content. This should never be a problem though if you use your own videos. Hopefully, there will be more and more persistent content uploaded for educational purposes. 
<LI><I>Alt+Left arrow</I> shortcut is used by Internet Explorer to return to the previously visited page. As a result, it also works like an Undo for your <B>Start:Stop</B> setting. To return to the previous page in SuperMemo, use the <B>Back</B> button (<A title="Back enables you to go back to the most recently visited element" class=image href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Back.gif"><img alt="Back enables you to go back to the most recently visited element" src="https://help.supermemo.org/images/f/f8/Back.gif" width=16 height=16 decoding="async"></A>) on the <A title="Navigation bar" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Navigation_bar">navigation bar</A> 
<LI>it may happen that your network is down or the Internet is slow when working with <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> videos. You may therefore prefer to first experiment with a dedicated incremental video <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1443" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A> to learn how to handle videos and prevent interruptions to learning in cases of network problems. You can always stop working with your incremental video <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1444" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A>, return to your regular learning, and resume video learning when the network returns to normal functionality 
<LI>if you would like to use SuperMemo as your <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> jukebox, you should also keep music videos in a single <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1445" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A> (or mark them all with a specific keyword for fast <A title="Subset learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning">subset learning</A>). You can later hide your jukebox <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1446" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A> in the system tray. Your jukebox will play only the selected fragments of individual videos in order of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1447" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority">priority</A> as specified in your <A title="Priority queue" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Priority_queue#Sorting_repetitions">sorting criteria</A>. As in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="1448" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>, using <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1449" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval">intervals</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1450" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority">priorities</A> is a good remedy against getting bored with a given song or video 
<LI>videos cannot be played in SuperMemo if their embedding is blocked (you will see a message <I>Embedding Disabled By Request</I>). Those videos you can only watch on <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A>. This means that those videos are pretty useless in your incremental video learning; however, you can still use prioritization and scheduling tools to choose which videos should be played in which sequence and on which day. Note also that many of those videos are uploaded multiple times by various users, and you only need to search for an alternative that can be embedded</LI></UL>
<H3><SPAN id=Your_own_incremental_video_script class=mw-headline>Your own incremental video script</SPAN></H3>
<P>Videos are handled with the help of <A class="external text" href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">YouTube Player API</A> in <A title="HTML component" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/HTML_component">HTML components</A> using a small JavaScript program. When you first run SuperMemo, it writes this script into a file stored in the <I>[BIN]</I> subfolder of the folder in which you installed SuperMemo. The name of the file is <I>YouTube.htm</I>. If you know JavaScript, you can substitute your own incremental video script in that file (e.g. to change the layout, size of buttons, or even add new functions for processing videos). Here are the only components of the script that you need to preserve: </P>
<UL>
<LI>the order of <CODE>INPUT</CODE> fields (these are used by SuperMemo to collect extract boundaries) 
<LI><CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>OPTION</CODE> fields for generating <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1451" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extracts</A>

<LI><CODE>INPUT</CODE> field that determines the position of video start and end (<CODE>id="startvideoat"</CODE> and <CODE>id="stopvideoat"</CODE>)(must be "<I>0:00:00</I>")</LI></UL>
<P>The most important change you may wish to introduce is to decide between <CODE>version=2</CODE> and <CODE>version=3</CODE> of the player. Both have their bugs and disadvantages. For more see <A class="external text" href="https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Incremental_video_does_not_work">Player Version Issues</A>.

<LI>incorporate learning into your e-mail communication (e.g. memorizing important facts related to your mail communication)</LI></OL>
<P>To fully use e-mail functionality in SuperMemo you will need Windows (Live) Mail (or any other e-mail client that support EML) or MS Outlook 2000 or later. At the very minimum, MAPI compatible mail would be needed for sending SuperMemo <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1456">elements</A> or objects via mail. </P>
<P>Here are the most important ways you can use SuperMemo in mail processing, and use e-mail in communicating your SuperMemo work: </P>

<LI><B>Using incremental learning tools to process mail</B>: <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1458">Incremental reading</A> is a powerful tool that helps you prioritize, schedule, and process mail. As a result, you may decide that instead of using your mail software, it is more convenient and rational to use SuperMemo to read and respond to your e-mail. Users of Windows (Live) Mail or MS Outlook can now import all their mail to SuperMemo with a keystroke. If you receive more mail than you are able to effectively process, you can use overload tools. You will immediately process only the most important pieces and proceed with others according to their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1459">priority</A> in proportion of available time. As in the learning process, rescheduling and sorting happens in the background, so that you never lose sleep over delaying a reply or being slow with processing excess mail. You can respond to longer pieces incrementally. 
<LI><B>Sending learning data to others</B>: If you encounter valuable information in incremental learning (or when processing mail), you can send it to your colleagues, friends, partners or family with a single click for inspiration or further discussion. For example, while reading an article about decoding human genome, you might find out that <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Venter">Craig Venter of Celera</A> comes from a Mormon family and that his father was eventually excommunicated. You can send such a note (or the whole article) from SuperMemo to your Mormon friend with a click of a button. 
<LI><B>Using mail material in incremental learning</B>: You may also incorporate snippets of mail in your learning process. You can treat most valuable pieces of e-mail as articles to read. If you receive highly inspirational messages, you may want to introduce it into incremental learning and memorize its portions to ensure long-term benefit. In other words, your mail may not only prompt action, but may also be used in learning to keep your memory up-to-date with things you care about. This way you can also learn from materials sent from others, esp. if those materials come in small portions extracted from an incremental learning process conducted by other people. You can also comment or respond to individual portions of the processed mail. You can do it while reading or when new ideas come to your mind upon review. You can use this process for the purpose of creativity (e.g. reviewing an inspiring idea or information in different contexts) or for the purpose of recall (e.g. trying to remember the university major of your cousin).</LI></OL><SPLIT1>

Incremental processing will help you remember names, contexts, events, and facts far better than when using other methods. You will not experience mental chaos caused by an overcrowded Inbox 
<LI><B>prioritization</B>: if you get more e-mail material than you are able to process, you can use incremental learning tools for prioritizing mail and its fragments. One of the greatest strengths of incremental learning is its unique system for efficiently determining the priority of the reading material with the help of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1469">priority queue</A>.

If you work in a team, it is a great idea to delegate some of your work; however, not all work can be delegated. Additionally, if you delegate, you do not learn from e-mail that you delegate. To answer the latter problem, you can choose a solution in the middle: delegate e-mail jobs and process inflowing pieces with the tools of incremental learning</LI></OL>

<LI><B>splintering e-mail</B>: some people dislike <A class="external text" href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=splinter">splintered</A> responses. They prefer to have their e-mail analyzed as a whole and responded to as a whole (preferably within an hour&nbsp;:). As an act of kindness, try to remember people's preferences and do not use incremental e-mail processing (too much) on those who do not like it 
<LI><B>incremental approach is not transitive</B>: incremental e-mail processing shows the greatest power for longer pieces of mail, article forwards, etc. For very short e-mail messages, incremental e-mail processing delivers less value per unit time. Because incremental mail processing leads to short communication bursts, it undermines its own power when used at both ends of the communication channel. However, even if you communicate in short sentences (i.e. without SuperMemo), keep the record of mail in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1470">collection</A> for <A title="Subset review" class=mw-redirect href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_review#Search_and_review">Search and review</A></LI></OL><SPLIT1>

Although many pieces of mail will get substantially delayed (or perhaps even neglected), top-priority mail will be processed in the first order, and damage done by urgency will be less. The above strategy may introduce an inevitable delay of up to 4 days in replying (Day #1 arrival, #2 review, #3 prioritizing, #4 processing); however, in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1478">incremental reading</A>, it is always the priority and quality that should come first ahead of speed and urgency.

<LI>SuperMemo picks the earliest <I>[mailto:</I> tag from your e-mail text as the default response addressee.

You can specify multiple recipients by separating their names with a semicolon. For example: <I>[mailto:miko;alex]</I> where <I>miko</I> and <I>alex</I> must be defined in your mail program's address book (e.g. Windows Live Mail address book).

<P>Many technical issues and bugs in SuperMemo have been solved with incremental problem solving methods.

<P>SuperMemo can be used in the process of creative writing, which combines two processes: </P>
<OL>
<LI>writing texts and 
<LI>creative review and elaboration.</LI></OL>
<P>Both processes are based on <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1505">incremental reading</A>. By analogy to <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1506">incremental reading</A>, this process is called <I>incremental writing</I>. </P>
<P>The technique of incremental writing was used to compile some of the materials at <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com">super-memory.com</A>. Most notably, <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm">Good sleep, good learning, good life (2012)</A>, and the present <A class="mw-selflink selflink">Incremental learning (2013)</A> article. </P>
<P>The main difference between traditional writing and incremental writing is that the writer is free to re-organize the material and review it with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1507">incremental reading</A> tools. </P>
<P>The main difference between <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1508">incremental reading</A> and incremental writing is that the "big picture" of the article is built primarily within the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1509">collection</A>, and to a lesser extent in the writer's mind. This is suitable for large fact-packed material that is difficult to organize sequentially. In addition, one's own writing may be the source of most input, as opposed to external electronic sources. Incremental writing is also suitable in a compilation of a large body of prior writing, esp. of materials that are repetitive, fact-rich, and often loosely connected. Incremental writing is less useful for texts with a linear line of thought. </P>
<P>Incremental article writing is an open-ended process that can be interrupted at any stage for the article to be exported to as a single document for text-flow rewrites. </P>
<P>Articles written using incremental writing may be particularly suitable for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1510">incremental reading</A>. They can be compared to <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>. <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">Crowdsourced</A> <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> is an excellent source for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1511">incremental reading</A> due to its incremental growth and solid local context.

They may be bloated and repetitive, however, with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1513">incremental reading</A>, they can be prioritized in a rational way.

<P>When the fun of writing is gone, the writer's block can ensue. SuperMemo makes writing fun as compared to traditional methods (e.g. writing in a word processor). If you are in no mood to write about one topic today, you might be more inclined to try something else. If you are in no mood for writing anything, tackle some minor clean up jobs. Very often, once you start writing, you get sucked into the effort and the mood returns. A piece of information can trigger new ideas. If it happens in your writing slot, you can instantly write down new ideas. You can write them rough and short. But you need to write them instantly. If you keep waiting, the memory of the inspiration whittles down to just the need to write about a subject! This is how forgetting affects your own ideas! Strike the iron while it's hot. Process inspiration incrementally, and pick the pieces that raise most enthusiasm at any given moment. Those pieces will generate most new creative value. </P>
<H4><SPAN id=Creative_explosion_vs._deadlines class=mw-headline>Creative explosion vs. deadlines</SPAN></H4>
<P>Excess creativity and wish to include valuable information or ideas may cause an unstoppable bloat of writing materials and a never-ending writing loop.

<P>Incremental writing will always be superior over linear writing for a class of non-fiction texts, however, the toolkit is difficult to master, and the strategies are not obvious. This is a new set of techniques that requires a high degree of innovative thinking on the part of the author. This is why we do not expect any significant degree of adoption at the moment. Incremental writing should primarily be considered by authors who are already masters of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1550">incremental reading</A>. </P><SPLIT1>
<H2><SPAN id=Incremental_brainstorming class=mw-headline>Incremental brainstorming</SPAN></H2>
<P>If you combine incremental learning with <A href="#Incremental_problem_solving">incremental problem solving</A> and plain old brainstorming, you will arrive at <I>incremental brainstorming</I>. The brainstorming part may be executed face-to-face or over e-mail. </P>
<P>Incremental brainstorming sounds like an oxymoron. Incremental brainstorming has very little to do with "storming", but it makes a very good use of the brain's capacity to build creative associations in fertile knowledge-rich conditions. Incremental brainstorming might be slow, but it can deliver more than plain face-to-face brainstorming. At worst, the outcome will be different, and in creative work, this is always a desirable complementary effect. </P>
<P>In face-to-face brainstorming, two or more brains, preferably with different strengths, specializations, and biases, engage into a fast exchange of ideas, where Idea X from Brain A might generate ideas Y and Z from Brain B, which in turn may cause a chain reaction of creative inspiration in other participating brains. Moreover, brainstorming requires a degree of mental discipline that may be missing in brainstorming with oneself (in one's mind, i.e. without incremental learning). Converting thoughts to speech slows down the thinking, but increases the discipline and may dramatically enhance creative outcomes. </P>
<P>In incremental brainstorming, this process is taken a few steps further. Incremental learning is a form of brainstorming with oneself, as mentioned in the <B><A title="Incremental reading" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading#Creativity_boost">Creativity</A></B> section, however, it can also be used in remote brainstorming via e-mail. The main tools of remote incremental brainstorming are: </P>

<LI>incremental learning (for processing knowledge), 
<LI><A title="Incremental mail processing" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_mail_processing">incremental mail processing</A> (for processing exchanged ideas), and 
<LI>e-mail communication (which may be supplemented by live video).</LI></OL>
<P>Incremental brainstorming may be slow, and yet it adds an additional degree of discipline with an archive of written communications. Most of all, it adds more sources of inspiration to the mix. In addition to the participating brains, incremental brainstorming adds inspiration from external sources of knowledge (with non-participating authors providing further inspiration). It also adds from the history of the communication. Due to forgetting, incremental brainstorming makes it possible to brainstorm with one's past self. In other words, the participants of incremental brainstorming include: </P>

<UL>
<LI><B>wider knowledge</B>: involvement of incremental learning in expanding upon the discussed ideas substantially extends the knowledge used in the creative process. This is a way of adding non-participating brains to the mix 
<LI><B><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect" data-hasqtip="1551">spacing effect</A></B>: when brainstorming is slowed down, fading memory traces evoke the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect" data-hasqtip="1552">spacing effect</A> that may: 
<OL>
<LI>provide for better long-term consolidation of ideas, and 
<LI>evoke new creative reasoning pathways in cases where the fading signal needs to be rebuilt via new pathway searches. </LI></OL>This is particularly valuable for hard-to-solve problems that may require the involvement of long-term memory and all its advantages (incl. problem modelling) 
<LI><B>circadian synchronization</B>: participating brains do not need to synchronize their peek performance hours (e.g. when working over different times zones) 
<LI><B>sleep</B>: few people realize the monumental role of sleep in creativity. <A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep">Neural optimization of memories in sleep</A> works like an automatic creative thinker that is autonomous from the conscious brain even though it feeds on creative processes that occur in waking. <B>Sleep is an organizer of memories and can convert results of brainstorming into new quality</B>. Incremental brainstorming is slower, it may span weeks or months. As such, it employs sleep mechanisms as new autonomous brains in the creative process. Sleep converts the chaos of data into abstract models that yield higher quality reasoning 
<LI><B>balancing attention and creativity</B>: in all creative pursuits, striking the ideal balance between creativity and attention is vital for the ultimate success. Our multitasking society is pretty good at stimulating creativity, however, the same factors that boost creativity have a destructive impact on attention. Incremental brainstorming helps you strike a balance between focused individual work and pulling the team brains together. You can brainstorm without ever interrupting each other 
<LI><B>free from reliance on the coincidence of interests</B>: face-to-face brainstorming often fails due to differing levels of interests or motivations in the participating parties. Moderating face-to-face and adding a bigger dose of incremental brainstorming may be an easy solution. In those cases, most of the workload may shift to a single brain, while still capitalizing on the contribution of the less involved brains </LI></UL>
<H3><SPAN id=Disadvantages_of_incremental_brainstorming class=mw-headline>Disadvantages of incremental brainstorming</SPAN></H3>
<P>The main disadvantage of incremental brainstorming is its snail's speed. Naturally, it won't be of much value right before a project's deadline. However, despite the hype speed receives in the media in reference to technological progress, the hardest problems are always solved by collective efforts of multiple brains working over generations. Incremental brainstorming might be less useful in hurrying a new iPad model, but it would be handy in slowly developing or slowly adopting theories like those of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</A>, <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Mendel</A>, <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener">Wegener</A>, and the like. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Future_of_brainstorming class=mw-headline>Future of brainstorming</SPAN></H3>
<P>Incremental brainstorming is not intended to replace face-to-face interactive collaboration. However, it should serve as its rich supplement. It carries all the advantages of incremental learning: creativity, attention, prioritization, meticulousness, consolidation, long-term sustainability based on long-term memories, and more. It requires a lot of training before it brings fruits. Therefore, if problem solving or creative work are vital for your progress, you might consider mastering the following progression of skills: classical SuperMemo (for better memory), incremental reading (for processing text), incremental learning (for overall learning), incremental problem solving (for employing knowledge in solving problems), to finally arrive at incremental brainstorming, i.e. combining incremental learning with classical brainstorming. </P><SPLIT1>

This is not exactly "opposite to learning with IR". This is more like a creative way to enhance your recall and understanding. Few things contribute as much to your learning as formulating other people's ideas in your own way. Long and complex articles can often be effectively summarized in 2-3 short sentences and thus contribute far more to your comprehension and long-term recall of the essential knowledge. One thing remains unclear, why should this function be separated from SuperMemo, and what tools are missing from <A title="Incremental reading" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> toolkit to enhance this process. -- SuperMemo Support</DD></DL>

<DD>When writing an article in this style the outcome that I have reached time and time again is a large tree structure (in the Contents window) with the most important information at the leaves (something like the outcome of incremental reading). To turn this information into an "article", one has to go to each leave individually and copy the text, then return to the original parent and paste it in order. Hence, I see the need for a "recomposition" tool that can take all information in the leaves and paste it into a single element using the order specified by the tree structure. -- Georgios Zonnios</DD></DL></DD></DL>

<P>Incremental learning might be as important to SuperMemo as the original <A class="external text" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/General_principles_of_spaced_repetition">repetition spacing idea</A>. Incremental learning eliminates a number of bottlenecks that limit various stages of <I><A href="#Knowledge_acquisition:_Areas_of_optimization">knowledge acquisition</A></I>. </P>
<P>The name <I><A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A></I> first appeared in SuperMemo 2000. However, the concept is not new. It originated from combining our natural reading habits with the demands of <I><A title=SuperMemo href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo">spaced repetition (SuperMemo)</A></I>. We rarely pick up a book and read it cover-to-cover in one go. At school we often dig through a number textbooks used for different courses. At home we stop reading a book to read a newspaper and then stop reading the newspaper to watch TV. A combination of needs and interests determines how far we go with the reading of an individual text. SuperMemo drives this concept to an extreme by letting you read just one sentence from one chapter from one book and then go on to reading <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1757">extracts</A> from a thousand books and/or articles. SuperMemo's contribution here is only the management of this multi-source reading process. As for the creative aspect of <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A>, <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Niels Bohr</A> is known to have used the power of intermittent reading and intermittent thinking to maximize his creative output. He would keep dozens of shelves with outlines of ideas. He would return to individual shelves from time to time, esp. if he was inspired by a conversation, thinking, experiment, or reading. He would then keep reading a single shelf, think and ponder, add new notes, etc. Many of those shelves ended up as scientific publications. In that sense, <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Niels Bohr</A> employed rudimentary <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> in his creative work. </P>
<P>The approach used in incremental reading is widely employed by many creative individuals. Even if it is far less formal that <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> or even <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Bohr</A>'s approach. <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gazzaniga">Dr Michael Gazzaniga</A> puts it this way: "<I>I think the creative process is directly related to the amount of time one spends mulling something over. I come back and revisit ideas, data, thoughts, all the time. I think this keeps key semantic networks active and then "bingo" an inconsistency or consistency suddenly presents itself to consciousness and the beginnings of a new idea appear</I>". </P>
<P>Here is a brief history of incremental reading: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Before SuperMemo (1980)</B>: The author of SuperMemo and co-author of this incrementally written text, <A class="external text" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</A>, in his student years, used his own "cross-the-notebook" method of learning. He would go through his paper notes and cross out those he was sure he would remember for the exam. He would read his notes over and over again until all the notes have been crossed out. Each pass was faster as there was less and less to read. That method was nearly a guarantee of excellent exam results. All his lecture notes were covered with crossed out shapes that surrounded pictures and portions of text. This "granular treatment" with "processing attributes" can be thought of as an early inspiration for future <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> 
<LI><B>SuperMemo algorithm (1984-1985)</B> - The first ever attempt to measure <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Optimum_interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Optimum interval" data-hasqtip="1758">optimum intervals</A> in learning resulted in the formulation of the SuperMemo method in 1985 
<LI><B>SuperMemo 1.0 (1987)</B> - The birth of SuperMemo is also the birth of <I>computational spaced repetition</I>, i.e. the use of computers in computing <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Optimum_interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Optimum interval" data-hasqtip="1759">optimum intervals</A> in learning

<LI><B><A class="external text" href="https://super-memory.com/articles/soft/sm99.htm">SuperMemo 99 (1999)</A></B> made the first step towards efficient reading of electronic articles by introducing <A class="external text" href="https://super-memory.com/articles/read.htm">reading lists</A> and the first primitive reading tools: <B>Extract</B> and <B>Cloze</B>. Reading lists were prioritized lists of articles to read. Extracts made it possible to split larger articles into smaller portions.

Other new features introduced by SuperMemo 2002: <A title="Web import" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Web_import">automatic learning material import</A> from Internet Explorer, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Mid-interval_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Mid-interval repetition" data-hasqtip="1766">mid-interval repetitions</A> that make it possible to review portions of material without damage to the learning process, e.g. before an exam (<A class="external text" href="https://super-memory.com/english/algsm11.htm">Algorithm SM-11</A>), <A href="#Search_and_review">search-based learning</A> (i.e. subset learning in which the subset is defined by advanced <A title="Find elements" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Find_elements">search tools</A>), dynamically modified <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="1767">A-Factors</A> that fine-tune the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1768">priorities</A> without user intervention, <A title=Postpone href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Postpone">postpone wizard</A> that makes <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Reading_list" oldtitle="Glossary:Reading list" data-hasqtip="1769">reading lists</A> obsolete, separate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1770">topic</A>/<A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1771">item</A> statistics and new <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> progress statistics, <A title=References href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">reference labeling</A>, and more. 
<LI><B><A class="external text" href="https://super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2004.html">SuperMemo 2004</A></B> was developed solely with the view to perfecting the tools of <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A>. The data collected from months of actual <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> was instrumental in enhancing the algorithm and the tools. Fine tuning of the modification of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1772">topic</A> <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="1773">A-Factors</A> enhanced the optimization of new material review in a heavily overloaded process. New tools included: rich statistics for monitoring and optimizing the learning process, tools for handling excessive delays in review, browsing sources of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1774">extracts</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="1775">clozes</A>, one-key <A title=References href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">reference labeling</A>, proliferating remote images, easy integration of remote images, and more. 
<LI><B><A class="external text" href="https://super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2006.html">SuperMemo 2006</A></B> made a major step in rationalizing the material <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Overload" oldtitle="Glossary:Overload" data-hasqtip="1776">overload</A> in <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental learning</A> by introducing the <I><A href="#Priority_queue">priority queue</A></I>. SuperMemo 2006 made it easier to import articles from the Internet (esp. from <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>). Material <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Overload" oldtitle="Glossary:Overload" data-hasqtip="1777">overload</A> could be handled with <A href="#Auto-sort_and_auto-postpone">auto-postpone and auto-sort</A> tools. SuperMemo 2006 simplified importing, arranging, compressing, converting, zooming, and trimming pictures. SuperMemo 2006 could pick any folder on the user's disk and convert all the file archives into material that can be processed incrementally (e.g. article archives, picture archives, family albums, movie clips, documentation files, or assorted archives). SuperMemo 2006 also made it simple to do one-key searches and import of auxiliary learning material on the web with customizable tools (e.g. Google, encyclopedias, dictionaries, picture archives, etc.). 
<LI><B><A class="external text" href="https://super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2008.html">SuperMemo 2008</A></B> extended incremental learning into the areas of pictures, sounds and video with <A href="#Visual_learning">visual learning</A> and YouTube-based <A href="#Incremental_video">incremental video</A>. Imports from the web, esp. <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> and YouTube became simpler with set <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1778">priorities</A>, <A title=References href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">references</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Category" oldtitle="Glossary:Category" data-hasqtip="1779">categories</A>, etc. SuperMemo 2008 also simplified and automated the process of creating <A title=References href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">source material references</A>. 
<LI><B><A class="external text" href="http://super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo15.html">SuperMemo 15 (2011)</A></B> improved <A title="Web import" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Web_import">web imports</A> (e.g. eliminating article duplicates), splitting articles (e.g. automatic splitting of <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> articles into separate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1780">topics</A>), <A title=References href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">handling references</A>, and more. As SuperMemo 15 provided a full Unicode support, <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> in languages other than English became easier. 
<LI><B><A class="external text" href="https://super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo16.html">SuperMemo 16 (2013)</A></B> consolidated all incremental learning technologies with the last two missing links: <A href="#Incremental_audio">incremental audio</A> and <A href="#Incremental_video">incremental video</A> with video files. It added more tools for <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> imports (e.g. downloading full resolution pictures intead of thumbs, etc.), and <A href="#Visual_learning">visual learning</A> (e.g. global paste). It also made it possible to separate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1781">extracts</A> from source articles in child <A title=Browser href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser">browsers</A>. Dozens of improvements to incremental learning process convert quantity into new quality. For example, SuperMemo 16 added import from Windows (Live) Mail, or a trivial, but extremely useful <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> function: <B><A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#delete_before_cursor">Delete before cursor</A></B>.
