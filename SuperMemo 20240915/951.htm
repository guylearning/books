Sweat equity is the value you have created for your business through your unpaid work. If your business should be paying you $100,000 per year for the job you perform in your business, and it takes you two years before you can draw your salary, you have just created $200,000 in capital through sweat equity. This is a very important concept, whether you have outside investors or not, because it lets you calculate your lost opportunity to earn market-based wages had you chosen to work elsewhere. If you have outside investors, it gives you a way to balance the worth of your effort with the money they invested. Either way, it&#8217;s a great opportunity to understand the difference between &#8220;I&#8217;m still putting in sweat equity and I&#8217;m not going to stop until I get my full salary&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;ve made an acceptable profit above my salary by calculating my real sweat equity!&#8221;
