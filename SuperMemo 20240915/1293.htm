During this $1 million to $5 million phase&#8212;and this goes back to what you learned in chapter 1&#8212;you need to pay yourself a market-based wage and get a return on your investment. Your goal is to still be profitable when you go from $1 million to $5 million, even though you&#8217;re not going to be as profitable as you were.

It simply means you leave the profits in your business to fund the growth rather than relying on debt or investors. That&#8217;s the whole strategy behind paying yourself a market-based wage. You need to live off your wage instead of living off the profits from your business. If you can&#8217;t do that, just stay in Kansas City. Don&#8217;t take the wagon train to California. You will not make it through the Badlands.

If you don&#8217;t have the provisions you need (a capital safety net) and you&#8217;ve already started the hiring process, you might find that you have to downsize to fix your business model and get profitable and healthy again. After that, you can try again to make it through the Badlands and reach California.
