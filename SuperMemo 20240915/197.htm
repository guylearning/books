<P>It is on these two drivers that managers must concentrate in order to improve performance. However, these ratios cannot be operated on directly. Each is dependent on a whole series of detailed results from widely separated parts of the operation. These in turn can be expressed in ratio form and all that managers need is a system that will enable them to identify and quantify these subsidiary values so that they can:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>set the target value for each ratio that, if achieved, will deliver the required overall performance level</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>delegate the achievement of these targets to specific individuals.</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>The system outlined in the following pages achieves this end. It will be seen that it incorporates all the main elements in both the profit and loss account and balance sheet. Each of the elements is a performance driver and must be managed accordingly.

<P>At its simplest, we can say that the margin is what is left when the total operating cost is deducted.</P></DIV>
<P>If the margin were 10 percent, the total cost would be 90 percent. The margin can be improved only if this 90 percent can be reduced. To reduce the figure, we must know its component parts. So, the next stage is identify the separate cost elements and see what percentage each of the main cost elements bears to sales (see <A title="Figure&nbsp;7.2.&nbsp;Drivers of margin on sales applied to data from the Example Co. plc" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch07.html#ch07fig02">figure 7.2</A>).</P>

The four main cost elements that accumulate to total operating costs are identified as materials, labor, factory overheads and admin/selling. These large cost groups are used for example purposes: in practice they would be broken down into much more detail.</P>
<P>In the lower part of the diagram, each cost element is shown expressed as a percentage of sales. For instance, the first box shows that materials is 38 percent (material cost of $426 over sales of $l,120 multiplied by 100). The sum total of all the costs is 90 percent, giving a margin of 10 percent.</P>
<P>If management wishes to improve this margin, then one or more of the cost percentages must fall. For instance, if the material cost percentage could be reduced by two points, from 38 to 36 percent, then, other things being equal, the margin percentage would improve by two points to 12 percent. This margin of 12 percent would then combine with the sales to total assets ratio of 1.4 times to give an improved return on total assets of 16.8 percent (that is, 12 percent multiplied by 1.4).</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Margin on sales &#8211; drivers" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>These cost ratios allow managers to plan, budget, delegate responsibility and monitor the performance of the various functional areas under their control. They can quantify targets for all areas, and calculate the effect of a variation in any one of the subsidiary ratios on the overall performance.</P>
<P>The results achieved by different managers, products and divisions can also be compared and the experiences of the best passed on to the others to help them improve. We must recognize, however, that there are operating factors that the model does not cope with. The variables of selling price, volume and product mix, which have such a powerful impact on profit, are not easily distinguished from other factors in the model. In later chapters these factors will be discussed further.</P></DIV>

Each of the main asset categories is related to sales.</P>
<P>The three major asset blocks in most enterprises are:</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Sales/total assets &#8211; drivers" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/tickmark.jpg" width=30></DIV>

<P>fixed assets</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>inventories (stocks)</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>accounts receivable (debtors).</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>The value of each in relation to sales is shown in the subsidiary boxes. For instance, the ratio for fixed assets is 2.5 times (from sales of $1,120 divided by fixed assets of $440). Note that the sum of these separate values does not agree with the sales to total assets ratio as did the sales margin on the other side with the operating costs. This is because they are expressed differently. If the reciprocals of the values are taken, the link will become clear.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Sales/total assets &#8211; drivers" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>To managers, this display shows the importance of managing the balance sheet as well as the profit and loss account. For instance, if the total assets could be reduced from $800 to $700, then the sales to total assets ratio would move up from 1.4 to 1.6 times. The effect on the return on total assets would be to increase it from 14 to 16 percent. If, in addition, the margin were increased by 1 percent to 11 percent, then the new return on total assets would be almost 18 percent (11 percent &#215; 1.6 times). The original value of 14 percent for ROTA is an average value whereas a return on total assets of 18 percent represents an excellent performance.</P>
<P>In these areas, production managers can work with finance and marketing departments to quantify targets for stock holdings and accounts receivable. The impact of an increase in fixed assets caused by a major capital investment project can also be assessed in profitability terms.</P></DIV>
