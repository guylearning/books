<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>O</SPAN>n the income statement, right under the line for Total Revenue comes the Cost of Goods Sold, also known as the Cost of Revenue. The cost of goods sold is either the cost of purchasing the goods the company is reselling or the cost of the materials and labor used in manufacturing the products it is selling. &#8220;Cost of revenue&#8221; is usually used in place of &#8220;cost of goods sold&#8221; if the company is in the business of providing <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=31 id=page_31></SPAN>services rather than products. Essentially they are the same thing&#8212;but one is a little more encompassing than the other. We should always investigate exactly what the company is including in its calculation of its cost of sales or cost of revenue. This gives us a good idea of how management is thinking about the business.
