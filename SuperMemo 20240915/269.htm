In the pursuit of more and more knowledge, you may develop a tendency to give careless answers and hastily jump from question to question in order to reduce the repetition time. There are no dangers related to fast repetitions on condition that the speed is achieved by simplicity of items rather than by negligence in providing answers. It is often possible to automatically answer a question without understanding its important implications. Instead of being semantic, i.e., based on the meaning, the repetitions become syntactic or literal, based on the automatic rendition of the item's wording.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>Is this item truly important for the skills I want to develop? 
<LI>Does the ability to answer the question truly ensure that I remember exactly what I want to remember? 
<LI>If I have any problems with remembering a given item, is it truly formulated in the simplest and most univocal way? (see: <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">20 rules of formulating knowledge</A>) 
<LI>If I have problems with a simple and univocal item, what mnemonic technique could I use to make it easier to remember? 
<LI>Are the following elements of the learning process suitably chosen? 
<UL>
<LI>The extent of the subject I want to learn (considering my learning capacity and availability of time) 
<LI>The degree to which I want to get into details 
<LI>The level of knowledge retention I want to reach (see: <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/fi.htm">Forgetting index</A>) 
<LI>The amount of time a day I can afford to spend on SuperMemo</LI></UL></LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>All these questions must recur again and again, and you must constantly maintain the highest level of alertness and concentration. The profits coming from mastering concentration skills are extraordinary!

It is highly recommended that you keep all your knowledge in one collection! You will notice that this greatly helps you put equal emphasis on all parts of the material. You should use the tools provided by SuperMemo to emphasize more important subjects (e.g. <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/fi.htm">forgetting index</A> or <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/review.htm">branch learning</A>)! Splitting your knowledge into many collections will often result in using negligence as your emphasis tool!
