<P class=noindent1a>Every Entrepreneur struggles to understand the dynamic relationship between profit and cash flow. Accountants have a report they refer to as a cash flow statement, but it is largely unreadable, even by accountants! Many entrepreneurs just print out a cash basis P&amp;L, which can work for small businesses that carry very little in accounts receivable or inventory. The missing purpose of why you need to keep your books on the accrual basis and monitor the balance sheet is to monitor profitability, and to have an understanding of how much capital it took for you to generate that profit&#8212;and when is it likely to turn into cash. If you gravitate to looking at cash basis reports, you do not understand the <I class=calibre8>trade capital </I>(a term I will define in the next chapter) that you had to fund to keep the business growing.</P>
<P class=noindent>Normally, during a consulting session, I would have the entrepreneur pull out their balance sheet and try to educate them on how the balance sheet moves as the business goes through seasonal cycles and growth. However, I have realized that the original design of the balance sheet was meant for the account-ants and not for understanding capital formation needs of the business. As I go through the explanation of proper capital needs for each business model, my goal is that you will come away with a better understanding of the four types of capital each business needs and what the capital signature of your model is, along with a way to measure capital efficiency and sufficiency.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-206 class=calibre4></A>I will break traditional accounting thinking by netting certain assets and liabilities rather than using the traditional accounting presentation of &#8220;assets on the left and liabilities on the right.&#8221; Who came up with that anyway? The correct way of thinking is to connect the functional assets with their respective liabilities and look at them net of each other.</P>
<P class=noindent>If you are an entrepreneur, I think you will find my approach intriguing, if not refreshing and insightful. If you are an accountant by training, you will likely struggle with it; but just remember that if our purpose is to help entrepreneurs better understand their business, you might want to take your cue from the entrepreneur and give this idea a shot!

<P class=sc><I class=calibre8>You have to learn </I>why <I class=calibre8>things work on a starship.</I></P>
<P class=center>&#8211; Captain James T. Kirk (<I class=calibre8>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</I>)</P>
<P class=noindent1a>As the CEO of your business, you can surround yourself with technical expertise in sales, marketing, operations, and finance, but you need to know <I class=calibre8>why </I>and <I class=calibre8>how </I>they all fit together. You will need a technical or intuitive understanding of profit and capital for each activity in your business.</P>
<P class=noindent>If you simplify all the business models in the world, they come down to three activities: manufacturing (make stuff), sales and distribution (sell stuff), or providing services (do stuff). You may do one, two, or all three of these activities, but each employs a distinct profit and capital model within the same business. However, if you want to scale your business, you should focus on the one thing you do best.</P>
<P class=noindent>If you are great at manufacturing but fall short in sales, you should partner with a sales organization. You might be great at selling stuff but not world class at making it, so contract with a manufacturer that can do it better for a lower price. It is not <A id=calibre_link-126 class=calibre4></A>uncommon for technology sales businesses to expand into providing services and fail miserably. They forget to account for service employee downtime that is not billable, and they struggle to interpret fluctuations from project to project because they are not selling tangible items with a consistent margin, as in the sales side of their business. They quickly learn that they need a lot more people in services to generate the same margin as one salesperson. And they struggle with the service value of each employee&#8212;a variable human component that does not exist in hardware.</P>
<P class=noindent>Once I started to categorize all my clients and their business segments into these three categories&#8212;make stuff, sell stuff, or do stuff&#8212;I saw an amazingly consistent set of metrics across all businesses of each type. These metrics help businesses with multiple types of activities understand where they make the most profit so they do not sacrifice their success in the pursuit of an activity they are ill-suited for, or in which they would have to sink money into fixing things.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Comparison of Make Stuff, Sell Stuff, and Do Stuff Models</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Let&#8217;s start our comparison of the three business models from a familiar point of reference: profit and loss (as shown in table 5.1).</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-300 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-332 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Table 5.1</B></H2>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Profit and loss comparison for businesses that make stuff, sell stuff, and do stuff</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=text1><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>* dLER is direct labor efficiency ratio. mLER is management labor efficiency ratio. See Chapter 8 for a detailed discussion on LER.</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><A id=calibre_link-28 class=calibre4></A><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00009.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-29 class=calibre4></A>The first thing to notice is the wide variation of gross margin. This is a prime example of why revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, and cash is king!</P>
<P class=noindent>There is also a wide variation in the contribution margin as percentage to sales and the direct labor efficiency ratio (dLER). The management labor efficiency ratio (mLER) is a little tighter, but it still varies a lot. Net income as percentage to sales varies widely, but notice that two out of three columns are essentially equal to net income as percentage to gross margin. That is still not a universal indicator, but it is worth paying attention to.</P>
<P class=noindent>Let&#8217;s dive into each example.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-23 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-333 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Make Stuff</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>The company in the &#8220;Make Stuff&#8221; column of table 5.1 is ultimately a $2.6 million manufacturing business. When you think about it, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is just a passthrough. If a customer wanted to use all their manufacturing capacity and said they would buy all the materials and supplies for everything the company makes, and if they asked the company for a manufacturing services quote, the price should be $2.6 million (all things being equal).</P>
<P class=noindent>The company might quote a lower price because the customer would be taking all the risk on materials and supplies, but I would encourage them not to do that since none of their operating costs would change. What does change is the amount of inventory they would need to carry. They might be able to lower the price some, depending on how much less capital they need to deploy. But hold that thought; we will evaluate it when we look at the Sell Stuff model.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-17 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-334 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Sell Stuff</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>The &#8220;Sell Stuff&#8221; example in table 5.1 is based on a distributor model. At first glance, you wonder how the company survives <A id=calibre_link-205 class=calibre4></A>on a 13% gross margin; but you can see that of the three businesses in table 5.1, they have the highest net income as percentage to gross margin at 23.21%. Once again, the harsh reality is that this business owner does not have a $40 million business. It is a $5.35 million inventory management company. To work on a margin this thin, they have invested in the best inventory management systems, processes, and automated handling capabilities. They are world class in their ability to execute a repetitive process because there is not enough margin for error&#8212;literally!</P>
<P class=noindent>I often tell my clients who sell stuff that the accounting process for inventory is theoretically very simple, but less than 5% of businesses who have inventory are good at it. Most businesses get close, true up the difference once a year (quarterly at best), and slug an unknown variance that no one can explain into COGS. Does that sound familiar to anyone?</P>
<P class=noindent>You could break down a Selling Stuff model into two segments: businesses that never handle inventory (or only what has already been sold so they can fulfill orders), and businesses that carry stock with no specific customer to buy it. From a capital perspective, if you stock your items, you carry more inventory and typically get paid at sale or carry lower accounts receivable. If you sell items that other companies fulfill, you will typically have higher accounts receivable waiting to get paid, which trades off the carrying cost of inventory. The worst capital structure is when a business gives corporate terms of 30-plus days on accounts receivable and also carries inventory. In that case, the business needs a really high profit margin to be viable because of the capital signature.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-18 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-335 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Do Stuff</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>While the &#8220;Do Stuff&#8221; business in table 5.1 has a nice profit in dollars, it is the hardest to scale because there is very little COGS <A id=calibre_link-30 class=calibre4></A>pass-through; it includes only subcontractors and materials. In this case, a subcontractor is a person or a company that performs a portion of the service at a rate of 130% of, or more than, what you would pay one of your employees to do the work. If you have freelancers or use a staffing company to provide direct labor, they should be shown as direct labor. Once the rate charged by a subcontractor exceeds 130%, you are essentially leaving enough margin in what you are paying to require some management oversight, and those costs should be accounted for as a passthrough in COGS.</P>
<P class=noindent>A services business generally has to get significantly more gross margin (and revenue!) to match the net income as percentage to gross margin of the other business types. Operating expenses as percentage to sales tends to be significantly higher than the other models. All of this leads to an underwhelming net income as percentage to gross margin, as compared to the other two business types. I have some services clients that can get to 20% or higher net income as percentage to sales, but they struggle to maintain it, and they struggle even more to scale it. There are only so many customers who will pay the kind of prices that produce that much profit.</P>
<P class=noindent>The thing you need to know is which of these business models you would rather have. What defining question does the data need to answer?</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-19 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-336 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>The Defining Question</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>The typical entrepreneur is profit-and-loss myopic. They look at gross margin, they look at how much labor they have to manage, they look at net profit, but they rarely look at the balance sheet. They speak of cash flow, but that is just the change in the balance sheet items, and it does not encompass everything they need to know.</P>
<P class=sca><A id=calibre_link-163 class=calibre7></A><I class=calibre14>The defining question:<BR class=calibre9>what is the ROIC for each business model?</I></P>
<P class=noindent>The real question you need to ask of the data is this: what is the return on invested capital (ROIC) for each business model? Before you can answer that question, you need to understand the four types of capital.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-298 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-337 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Four Types of Capital</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Every business model has a capital signature that is influenced by the type of capital required to run that model. They have common characteristics, which explains why one business with gross margin of 13% can thrive while another business fails at that same percentage. A business can have 20% net income and go broke without outside investment to support it.</P>
<P class=noindent>Let&#8217;s take a look at the four types of capital:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Trade capital 
<LI class=calibre11>Infrastructure capital 
<LI class=calibre11>Buffer capital 
<LI class=calibre11>Launch capital</LI></UL></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-22 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-338 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Trade Capital</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>The term <I class=calibre8>working capital </I>has always bothered me. It is taught in accounting school, and bankers have faithfully beat up their borrowing customers with that metric for years. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. It seems simple enough, but it tells an incomplete truth. Working capital contains two items: cash on the asset side, and line of credit on the debit side. I choose how much cash I keep in the business and how much I decide to put in or take out. I choose whether to borrow funds from the bank or put my own cash in to support accounts receivable and inventory.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-171 class=calibre4></A>Because my firm models every business we work with, I started looking into this deeper and realized there was a clear subcomponent of working capital lurking below the surface. Trade capital is working capital with cash and line of credit (all short term debt) stripped out. It is the net of accounts receivable, inventory, and work in progress, less accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue. The resulting number tells you how much recurring income you will have at this volume of sales. Unless you act to change terms with vendors and customers, trade capital will remain constant in your model, and we use it to predict cash flow from operations rather than needing to predict each individual line of trade capital for forecasting.</P>
<P class=noindent>It was eye opening to discover that the easiest way to predict operating cash flow is not the action of the individual trade capital components, but the harmony of how they interact; and I only need to look at the net number. By looking at the net number, it also helps my strategy decisions. For example, I can worry about inventory levels, but when my vendors give me good enough terms that I have no real net cost of carry, why would I ever risk being out of stock?</P>
<P class=noindent>This is the weakness of the traditional balance sheet presentation. If I were to redesign it, I would net the elements of trade capital in one group, instead of putting assets on the left and liabilities on the right. For all our clients, we add this net number in our balance sheet presentation, then we show trade capital as a percentage of rolling 12 revenue. The power of this calculation is amazingly simple:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-172 class=calibre4></A>If your trade capital percentage to revenue is lower than your net income percentage to revenue, you are in the cash-free growth zone. You can accept growth and not burn cash, as long as net income percentage is higher than trade capital percentage. 
<LI class=calibre11>If your trade capital percentage to revenue is higher than your net income percentage to revenue, you have to use the base camp growth method. To grow, you will burn cash to invest in accounts receivable or inventory; you can grow only as far as your cash and debt resources allow. Then you pause for a time to let the cash flow catch up, and you let it build it for another growth run to the next base camp.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>This is why some companies have linear growth and others have a growth spurt, flatten out, and have a growth spurt again.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-180 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-339 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Infrastructure Capital</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Infrastructure capital is easy to understand because it is the cost of your fixed and intangible assets net of the debt that supports particular assets, which normally include equipment, furniture, and building and leasehold improvements. It also includes intangible assets in a business purchase of goodwill items.</P>
<P class=noindent>In this case, the proper utilization of debt can make a huge difference in the return on investment. In a typical scenario, the bank wants you to put about 20% down on real estate and somewhere between 0% and 20% for leasehold improvements and equipment, depending on your credit history. We accountants make this a lot harder than it needs to be, as I describe in the following real-life scenario.</P>
<P class=noindent>Suppose you go to the car dealership and buy a truck for your business that costs $50,000. To get the best financing rate, you pay $5,000 down and drive away with the truck. Your accountant asks you what the $5,000 purchase was for that is booked to fixed assets, and you tell them about the truck purchase. This sets off a series of accounting adjustments:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-159 class=calibre4></A>Fixed assets are debited for $45,000 to get the full asset value, and $45,000 is credited to book the note payable. 
<LI class=calibre11>Each payment on the note is recorded. A credit is booked to the expense account where the note payment was recorded until the accountant found out about it, a debit is booked for the principal portion, and a debit is booked for the interest portion. 
<LI class=calibre11>Depreciation is booked, which should be done monthly but is usually done once per year. Most businesses book it as tax depreciation instead of true book depreciation over the useful life of the asset.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>You can see why entrepreneurs hate accounting and easily get confused. If you book the down payment to an expense account called truck expense, and you book each note payment to truck expense, you would end up with <I class=calibre8>exactly </I>the same outcome over the life of the asset with a third of the accounting entries (this is essentially equivalent to the old rules of booking an operating lease). Certainly, this would be a violation of generally accepted accounting principles, but it would be closer to economic truth and easier to read and understand. If you had to send the bank a financial statement, you would note the departure of accounting process and let them know the current balances on the equipment notes. The bank already ignores the book value of fixed assets and looks at the market value for your equipment.</P>
<P class=noindent>I do not expect my thinking to become the standard of accounting presentation, but it is necessary for entrepreneurs to grasp ROIC concepts. Here is a real-life story to illustrate the point.</P>
<P class=noindent>A retail store client visited our office for a planning day. For their first five stores, they paid for the buildouts with their own funds to the tune of $200,000 to $300,000 each. We applied the ROIC <A id=calibre_link-31 class=calibre4></A>principle of 50% return standard, and they were just above it. When I modeled the potential return for the sixth store, I had them finance the buildout and treat the payment effectively as rent. As a result, the ROIC potential on that store shot up to 200%! Essentially, financing the buildout and converting it to an operating expense removed a huge barrier to scaling and provided an incredible ROIC. I told the client to be mindful that if the store fails, they will still have to pay the debt, but they will also have to pay the rent for the term of the lease. There is economically no difference, so it can be accounted for in the same way if you are looking for economic reality instead of traditional accounting presentation.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-236 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-340 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Buffer Capital</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>In my first book, <I class=calibre8>Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!</I>, I established a cash standard for all businesses. It says that cash should always be equal to two months of operating expenses and zero drawn on a line of credit. Essentially, any expense you do not get terms on would be part of this calculation (all labor and operating expenses). The way I arrived at this was to research four years of client data and look for the deepest negative cash flow cycle in any given month. For a normally operating business, I never saw a dip greater than two months of operating expenses.</P>
<P class=noindent>As we started sharing this metric and driving our clients to use it, we realized the best part was that entrepreneurs could easily see how much cash is enough and how much cash is too much. It clearly defined what it looks like to be fully capitalized. I am fine with debt, and I even encourage it when it matches the true useful life of a productive asset like buildings and equipment. But the perpetual financing of trade capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory, put severe constraints on a well-functioning business.</P>
<P class=noindent>My approach was proven in 2008. The media was full of reports about lines of credit being pulled from businesses, but my clients <A id=calibre_link-221 class=calibre4></A>were not concerned. Instead, they asked me how to protect their cash in such a crazy market. I then realized they had been listening. In the three years that followed, while everyone was complaining about a recession, my clients enjoyed some of their most profitable years because they had cash and, therefore, market power. Because of the recession, their growth was limited to taking over competitors&#8217; accounts, but they fared better than those who went out of business because of being overleveraged.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=calibre_link-341 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Debt Roulette</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>In his book <I class=calibre8>Fooled by Randomness</I>, Nassim Nicholas Taleb says that trusting the market is like playing Russian roulette for $100,000 per pull. You might get lucky and get ahead by $1 million, but eventually you die. This is how debt goes bad. You go to the well once too often, and that final push takes you down.</P></DIV>
<P class=noindent>Over my years of monitoring the cash standard, I have seen a few businesses struggle to maintain two months of cash and meet the ROIC standard. Staffing companies are a great example. We have several clients in this industry, and many have to rely on factoring invoices to manage cash flow. However, one client faced the challenge by asking for, and receiving, up-front payments. Sometimes you just have to ask! Some markets will not allow this, but be creative. Bill quickly, bill often, and if you can get either a deposit or a retainer, you will significantly lower your capital requirement and boost your ROIC.</P></DIV></DIV>

<P class=noindent1>I refer to launch capital as the magic pixie dust for scaling business. The magic comes from its elusiveness, buried in your financial data, and only entrepreneurial wizards who have a gut <A id=calibre_link-207 class=calibre4></A>for business know how to use it. My mission is to level the playing field for all entrepreneurs, so here is how to become a wizard.</P>
<P class=noindent>Simply speaking, launch capital is the operating losses you incur before a business activity becomes profitable. It is most easy to understand at initial launch, but it continues throughout the life of your business as you scale or respond to new competitive pressures of the market. This chapter discusses capital for initial launch, and Chapter 6 is all about launch capital during a growth phase.</P>
<P class=noindent>When I gave a speech to a group of entrepreneurs, a successful business owner whom I will call Bob was in attendance. I did not know his numbers, but I had been told he was a great businessman who had 15 auto service stores, and he was a good mentor to the group. Bob consented to let me use him as an example of the ROIC concept and let me see how good my guesses were!</P>
<P class=noindent>I said, &#8220;Bob, my guess is that it will cost you about $1 million for the dirt and the metal building to put up a new store.&#8221; He agreed, and I continued: &#8220;The bank will finance 80%, so you will need $200,000 of your own money to put down.&#8221; He agreed again. &#8220;Once the building is complete, you will have about $200,000 of opening costs and operating losses to cover until the store breaks even.&#8221; Bob paused, smiled, and said, &#8220;Yep, that is exactly what we budget.&#8221; I continued with the final piece: &#8220;Your go/no go decision for this location will be based on whether you think there is enough traffic to get this store to produce at $200,000 net profit run rate within 12 to 24 months. It will take you the first 12 months to get going, but you should get to at least $200,000, an average of $16,666 per month, by the twelfth month or sooner, but no later than 24 months.&#8221; After I finished, Bob gave me one of the best compliments I have ever received: &#8220;What you just told me in two minutes took me 20 years to figure out!&#8221; Bob is a business wizard. He does not need accountants to tell him how to run a business; they only need to handle his <A id=calibre_link-64 class=calibre4></A>compliance work and provide data to other people because he knows his numbers in his gut. I hope these concepts help passionate entrepreneurs who do not have a gut for numbers build successful businesses.</P>
<P class=noindent>The two parts that entrepreneurs miss are correctly calculating the launch capital needed for start-up costs and the operating losses they need to cover until they break even. The operating losses require capital, just like buildings and equipment; but they are accounted for on the profit and loss statement, not on the balance sheet. To effectively see this requires a nonstandard presentation of financials to first predict the losses, then to measure your return for making that investment. It is also easy for entrepreneurs to predict the best-case scenario and not be prepared for the worst case.</P>
<DIV class=box>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Case Study: The Importance of High Return with High Risk</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Several years ago we had a client who needed to open new offices in other cities to grow their respiratory care business. We correctly estimated that they would have $150,000 of launch capital invested before the location would break even. They launched the first location and were about $60,000 into it when they realized the political alignments of the needed referral sources were not likely to make this location a success. They abandoned the office and got out of their lease. (Fortunately, they negotiated a reasonable up-front penalty in case they needed to leave.)</P>
<P class=noindent>They picked the next city and tried again. The same issues came up when they were about $75,000 into it, and once again they pulled out. The third location worked out. The <A id=calibre_link-220 class=calibre15></A>new office was profitable well before the $150,000 was spent. That location produced over $750,000 of profit annually for several years, making it a great return on investment even if you include the two misses.</P>
<P class=noindent>This is what business is all about. You may realize by now that growing a business is really running a legal gambling enterprise! You need a high return because the risk of failure is real. If you take the return potential out of business (including higher taxes), failures increase and investors look for other places to put their money and effort. Learn to make good bets and cut losses quickly to save your cash for another try.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=calibre_link-343 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Capital Signature</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Now that we have an understanding of the four types of capital, and before we dive into launch capital for the growth phase of a business in Chapter 6, let&#8217;s look at the capital signatures for businesses that make stuff, sell stuff, and do stuff. Table 5.2 shows this breakdown and is a continuation of table 5.1, where we looked at the profit and loss for each business type.</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-217 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 5.2</B></P>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Capital signature for businesses that make stuff, sell stuff, and do stuff</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00036.jpeg"></P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-269 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-344 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Make Stuff Capital Signature</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>In the Make Stuff model in table 5.2, you can see that trade capital includes accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable. This model works for cash flow because vendors are willing to carry terms on inventory, so the company does not have to pay for inventory until it is used. Many manufacturing companies also have work in progress if the item they make has stages to its completion.</P>
<P class=noindent>Notice that the trade capital percentage to revenue is 12.30% and the profit percentage to revenue is 13.30%. This means the company essentially breaks even for cash flow on growth. If they decide to accept a lower percentage of profit to grow, say 10%, <A id=calibre_link-164 class=calibre4></A>they would grow in a cash-negative cycle that would limit their growth potential. The only thing they could do then would be to use the base camp approach to growth that I described earlier&#8212; use only their existing cash plus line of credit, wait for their cash to catch up and build, then grow again.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-270 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-345 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Sell Stuff Capital Signature</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>The Sell Stuff model in table 5.2 represents a distributor, and they carry inventory and receivables. They run a tight ship on collections and inventory turnover, so their vendors fund almost all of their receivables and inventory. You can see that they are slightly better on trade capital percentage to revenue and net income percentage to revenue. This means that, for now, they can grow their profit and cash equally, but they cannot let any trade capital components go negative on them or it collapses quickly. When the percentages are very small, it requires even closer monitoring than normal to not let it flip and go cash negative.</P>
<P class=noindent>Some distribution companies only sell products and never take possession of the items they sold. In many of those cases, their profit margin is very low and they have to give longer terms, which often negates the benefit of not carrying inventory. I can still see this as a better play if a company is not good at building a team of people to effectively manage inventory. In table 5.2 you can see that they have a significantly higher infrastructure capital number than the other two models because of their inventory management equipment and software investment, such as bar coding and radio-frequency identification (RFID) capability.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-233 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-346 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Do Stuff Capital Signature</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Instead table 5.2 you can see why businesses that do stuff struggle with ROIC. If this services business did not have deferred revenue, their ROIC would be close to 33%. Based on public markets, that would be okay, but it underperforms all other models and explains why service firms break up easily and often <A id=calibre_link-193 class=calibre4></A>fail to scale. They do not have an understanding of their capital requirement or the discipline to meet a capital goal, even if they have one. Many professional services firms we work with have a hard time breaking away from the old model of stripping all their cash out each year and living on their line of credit until they pay it back. To expose the weakness in this approach, all it takes is one year where the balance on the line of credit does not go down and there is no cash. Their highest-performing employees end up leaving, and they are left with only their weakest performers.</P>
<P class=noindent>This is one model where I can see a one-month core capital number if a company has a strong recurring client billing. But if the billing can be random and lumpy, they should commit to the two-months rule.</P>
<P class=noindent>The company in table 5.2 is in a cash-free growth zone due to the deferred revenue. Once again, if the deferred revenue ever goes away, their trade capital would jump to roughly $1.5 million with the same profit of roughly $1 million (their trade capital percentage to revenue would be 15%), and they would run out of cash while they are waiting to get paid. Instead of growing quickly, they would need to use the base camp approach to growth.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>CPR: Cash Power Ratio</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>To drive home the picture of the cash-free growth zone, we created the Cash Power Ratio (CPR) in Figure 5.1.</P>
<P class=imgc><A id=calibre_link-71 class=calibre4></A><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00024.jpeg"></P></DIV></DIV>

<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Cash power ratio (CPR).</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=noindent>If you plot your Profit % to Revenue against your Trade Capital % to Revenue, you can see where you fit on the Cash-Free Growth Zone. It has been fascinating to see businesses adapt their profit and capital approach to their business once they see this.</P></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-348 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Growth with Outside Capital</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>If your trade capital percentage to revenue is greater than your profit percentage to revenue, you can look for outside capital to help. The problem is that private equity firms are usually not interested unless they can deploy large amounts of investment with very predictable returns. They seem intrigued at first, especially if you utter the words &#8220;recurring revenue,&#8221; but they get nervous if you continue to chew through cash as you grow. In some cases an investor can take a recurring revenue stream and make a fixed yield on it, but those opportunities are hard to come by unless the revenue stream is a strong contract.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-72 class=calibre4></A>Outside investors seem to be interested in funding launch capital spending to move the needle on your sales and bring it up to speed, where it requires less catalytic spending to keep the momentum going. If an investor is going to spin the roulette wheel of growth, it had better have a big upside&#8212;or at least your story should sell that idea!</P></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-349 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>The Defining Question Revisited</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Earlier in this chapter we formed a defining question: what is the ROIC for each business model? We can see in table 5.2 that the Make Stuff, Sell Stuff, and Do Stuff models have a similar ROIC, but the Sell Stuff (distribution) model wins by a nose! However, the Make Stuff (manufacturing) model has the least amount of volatility if any of the trade capital items shift toward the negative (such as if customers take longer to pay or vendors require payment sooner). And, as we saw in the discussion of capital signature for a services business, the Do Stuff (services) model comes in last in ROIC.</P>
<P class=noindent>Does this mean that the Sell Stuff model is the winner? On paper, the answer is yes. But, like most things in life, it depends. Regardless of which type of business you have, a solid understanding of three business models, the types of capital, and your capital signature will help you succeed and make your model best in class.

<P class=center>&#8211; Greg Crabtree</P>
<P class=noindent1a>It is easy to understand the story I told in Chapter 5 about launch capital for Bob&#8217;s next store. As I continued to study business models and conduct analysis calls with clients, it became clear that we were always making adjustments for special spending to explain why profit was down. Every entrepreneur likes to experiment. They hear what someone else did and want to give it a try&#8212; a new form of marketing, a new key executive who promises to be the missing link to sales, a high-priced consultant with the right elixir to cure all your ailments.</P>
<P class=noindent>All those things can be either productive or destructive, but you need to establish an outcome expectation like we did for Bob&#8217;s next store. Once you have a framework for setting the expectation, you can evaluate the new spending with a clearer mind. You will not be able to predict the outcome, but you will be able to hold the experiment accountable, like my respiratory client did when he jettisoned bad locations to save precious capital (see Chapter 5).</P>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-198 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Causation versus Correlation in Spending and Growth</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>The idea of setting expectations for special spending began to gel when I was working with a software company. They were fortunate enough to have a customer-funded business model like John Mullins talks about in his book <I class=calibre8>The Customer-Funded Business </I>(which I highly recommend). Since this company often collected one to three years of annual subscriptions up front, they never had to search for cash to grow the business. What they had to search for was the catalytic spend that would accelerate growth.</P>
<P class=sca><I class=calibre14>A catalytic spend is when you bet that<BR class=calibre9>an expenditure will fuel growth.</I></P>
<P class=noindent>When a software company is built to sell from its inception, growth experts question the company&#8217;s motive to be profitable. They say the company&#8217;s goal should be to spend every cent of their available cash to grow. I am all for that idea if you know the <I class=calibre8>causation </I>effect of spending on growth. But when you know only the <I class=calibre8>correlation </I>of spending and growth, you can become wasteful in your spending strategies to spur growth. Did you grow because of your spending, or in spite of it?</P>
<P class=noindent>Each year my software client diligently planned for their growth spending, and we plotted the potential increase in the business value if the results turned out as predicted. For a fourto five-year period they risked annually between $500,000 and $1 million on growth initiatives (sales, marketing, and technology development), and I asked them to evaluate how the spending impacted sales. Each year they admitted that there was little to no effect. The company was indeed growing, but that growth was organic and resulted mostly from the strong market position of their product in their particular niche.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-201 class=calibre4></A>I think the company could have saved and distributed about $4 million if they had not wasted so much on growth initiatives, but the company sold for a very nice number and you do not have to feel sorry for them. Their annual planning exercise drove home a point to me. I started to identify discretionary and catalytic spending and wondered if we could measure the impact.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>How to Measure Success in Growth Spending</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>I decided that the most critical measure of spending success had to be an increase in net income. If I use revenue to measure success, there is too much of a tendency to give up price and margin to increase volume. There are some risky build-to-sell business strategies that focus on getting sales first and profit later. This approach was used by many online retailers until about 2015 or 2016. Since then, the buyer market for these types of businesses has dried up. Many of those who did buy these companies have remorse and are stuck with businesses that have high revenue, no profit, and no way to become profitable. As my good friend Alan Miltz, creator of cashflowstory.com, says, &#8220;Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, and cash flow is king!&#750;</P>
<P class=noindent>I considered using gross margin or contribution margin to measure spending success. Both of these are better than using revenue, but they still allow for giving in on price and stressing the labor support model, even though some extra margin dollars were produced. For as harsh as it may be, profit needed to be my yardstick.</P>
<P class=noindent>Next I had to decide on the time frame. In considering how long to wait for a return, I stuck with my idea for the business model itself: a minimum of 12 months, a maximum of 24 months. Some high-risk, high-return businesses might need longer, but they are in the minority. A business will not reach its fullest growth potential from spending for 12 to 24 months, but it should be far enough along to begin reaping rewards and growing profitably.</P>
<P class=scl><A id=calibre_link-223 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>A Real-World Example Over Five Years</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>To demonstrate this idea in the real world, a client of ours allowed us to share his phenomenal experience over a five-year growth cycle. Since we held monthly calls with the client during this time, we knew that their catalytic spend was an annual increase in marketing expenses over the previous year&#8217;s maintenance spend. Their discretionary choice to add to the annual marketing spend was the first cost; they had the luxury of adding labor and other operating costs only after they knew that new revenue was flowing. Companies will not always have that luxury, but they did. Also, their marketing spending was not transactional, such as spending for AdWords or search engine optimization; it was old-fashioned travel, entertainment, and trade shows.</P>
<P class=noindent>Their story starts in the first year we started working with them when they had $700,000 in revenue. They had just started getting profitable and felt like they needed to risk some new spending to drive their business (see table 6.1).</P>
<P class=noindent>They decided to make a bold move and increase their marketing spend by $121,000 over the previous year&#8217;s spend of $75,000. That meant an increase of $60,000 in net income was needed to claim success. You can see that they got close, which is not bad for a first effort with a 45% return. As you can see, their other costs increased, but we know that those were after the marketing spend and after the new revenue streams were known.</P>

<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-111 class=calibre4></A>At this point we have to revisit my three simple rules for business success from Chapter 1 and reevaluate:</P>
<OL class=calibre10>
<LI class=calibre11 value=1><I class=calibre8>Did they figure out what the market needs? Check! </I>The new revenues and customers were a sign that they were on the right path and there was more market share to be had. 
<LI class=calibre11 value=2><I class=calibre8>Did they find a way to do it profitably? Check! </I>Their profit was not as high as they would like, but they have a very low capital signature, and even at 5% profit they were cash-flow positive. 
<LI class=calibre11 value=3><I class=calibre8>For the amount of required capital, did they achieve a pretax profit of 50% or better return on invested capital (ROIC)? Check! </I>Since their business model allowed them to get paid before they paid their vendors, they were above 50% ROIC, even at 5% net income to revenue.</LI></OL>
<P class=noindent>Let&#8217;s look at year 2 in table 6.2. Jackpot!</P>
<P class=noindent>When something works well, do you have the guts to keep going? The company decided they needed to increase spending again, but they wanted to trim the additional amount to $100,000. That means their increase in profit success over the previous year was now defined at $50,000. They had a blend of recurring and onetime customers, so they needed to continue marketing to existing customers and find new ones.</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-33 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 6.2</B></P>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Launch capital example: Year 2</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00034.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent1a>You can see in table 6.2 that they blew their $50,000 goal out of the water with a 493% return, and their profit jumped to $628,000 at 17% to revenue! Part of this extra profit came from the previous year&#8217;s new customers reaching full potential. Unless you <A id=calibre_link-122 class=calibre4></A>analyze specific customers, it is hard to tell how much came from the current year increase in marketing spend versus the prior year since the company continued to pay for travel to all clients for ongoing marketing and to defend them from competitors. They would definitely benefit from tracking sales growth for both new and existing customers and reporting the results regularly.</P>
<P class=noindent>In two short years this company jumped from $700,000 to $3,600,000 in revenue; more importantly, they jumped to $628,000 in net income at a rate of 17.36%! Should they sit here and harvest, or should they push ahead? This is always a critical juncture for an emerging business, and there are several key questions to answer:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Are you in the black hole? This company is right in the middle of the black hole, which is defined as between $1 million and $5 million in revenue (or in certain circumstances, gross margin). The deepest, darkest moment is usually at $3 million. If you are profitable at $3 million, you are usually functioning with your hair on fire because you have an unsustainable labor structure and not enough, or not the right, management to keep things together. Your only choices are to pull back to $2.5 million or less to maintain sanity and reduce stress, or push through to $5 million and upgrade your management processes and people. 
<LI class=calibre11>What do you want as an owner? Some people think they have hit the jackpot if they make $600,000 in profit above their market wage. Others want to know if there is more market share to be had. 
<LI class=calibre11>Are you maintaining 50% ROIC or better as you grow? My client was at well over 100%, which was definitely a green light.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>What did my client decide? To keep going!</P>

<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-170 class=calibre4></A>They decided to add $400,000 to their spend and really go big. This time, success would be measured as an increase of $200,000 in net income. Well, they missed it. They did have revenue growth, but net income was flat. Some businesses would still call this a success, but I was proud that they did not. Instead, they critically evaluated what happened:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>The things they had historically spent money on stopped working as well. The funny thing about marketing expenses is that the deployment must vary because the market becomes desensitized to your message. It is like seeing a new TV commercial and thinking it is clever at first, but by the 20th time you are sick of it. 
<LI class=calibre11>There is only so much messaging the market can handle at one time. In software development, adding another programmer can slow down a project; similarly, too much marketing in one area diluted the company&#8217;s message and may have aggravated their customers because of too much contact. 
<LI class=calibre11>Their final conclusion was to rework their maintenance marketing spend and be more judicious about how much new spending to add.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>The result worked like a charm for the next two years, as you can see in table 6.4.</P>
<P class=noindent>The company moderated their spend increase for year 4 to $166,000, and once again they knocked it out of the park with a 91% return. Then in year 5 they added another increase of $154,000 to marketing and got an even better return of 286%. Eventually their current spend could be reduced to make their</P>

<P class=noindent>profit go up considerably, but that could backfire because their customers could wonder why they do not hear from the company anymore, why their website still has the same graphics it had five years ago, why their team member page still has pictures of employees who are long gone, and why their last blog post is 18 months old.</P>
<P class=scl><A id=calibre_link-165 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Consider Your Geography</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>This company&#8217;s experience gives hope to any business that has less than $1 million in revenue. It grew from $700,000 to $10 million in revenue in five years, was profitable every year, and used zero debt to get there. As a matter of fact, they were cashflow positive and had plenty of cash to distribute even after taxes were paid. When I show this example, people always ask me what kind of business this is. The answer is not important because most businesses we work with have the same capital signature and profit potential. The one detail I will share is that they are not geographically limited in their customer base.</P>
<P class=noindent>Professor David Wessels from the Wharton School, who introduced me to the power of the ROIC concept, often says, &#8220;it is not your share, it is your where.&#8221; The next percentage of market share in a limited geography is very costly to acquire, as opposed to gaining an even smaller percentage of market share in a bigger geographical area. There is no way my firm would be as big as we are if we deployed our current business model for just Huntsville, Alabama. We chose to take geography out of our business model, and now 85% of our clients are not in our city. As I often say, &#8220;When I am in Huntsville, I am a local CPA; when I leave town, I am an expert.&#8221;</P>
<P class=noindent>Not every business model is suited to serve multiple geographies, and some companies that have tried failed miserably because they did not invest in the management and serviceability to make it successful. This goes back to your personal choices. If you do not feel confident or just do not want to expand geographically, then don&#8217;t. It is your choice, but remember what Professor Wessels says: <I class=calibre8>where, not share. </I>If you limit yourself geographically, it will be a self-imposed constraint on your business potential, and you must accept the challenges it brings. You can look for ways to overcome any constraint, but you need to be clear that geography choice is a critical business strategy.</P>

<P class=noindent1>I wish I could say that all our clients carefully plan their launch capital and use our accounting structure and reporting process, but entrepreneurs tend to be free wheeling and then retrofit our Simple Numbers analysis on the fly to gain financial clarity.</P>
<P class=noindent>One such example is described later in this section, but first let&#8217;s take a look at my firm&#8217;s unique Simple Numbers approach. We use it for every client, regardless of industry.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-237 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-351 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Simple Numbers Analysis</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>The principles of our Simple Numbers analysis and presentation are as follows:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Every month ends a 12-month accounting cycle</I>. The ending month does not matter; the data is just as meaningful for any given 12 months. Rolling 12 data is the best form of financial truth for profit-and-loss presentations. It eliminates every excuse because it includes an entire year&#8212;all holidays, all four calendar seasons, and all business cycle seasons. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>It reveals behavioral economics. </I>There have been studies on how people use annual and monthly data to make key decisions. The results show that control groups who used only annual data to make buy and sell decisions for stock portfolios traded less frequently and had a higher yield than the group that traded only with monthly information. A month is a horrible unit of time to base decisions on. Accounting processes struggle to effectively report on monthly data, no matter how skilled your finance team is. No months are equal, but all 12-month periods are equal.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Our Simple Numbers summary view is robust and serves clients in all industries for the following reasons:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-65 class=calibre4></A><I class=calibre8>It does not mix labor with cost of goods sold, so gross margin can be used as the true economic top line of the business. </I>Essentially, cost of goods sold are pass-through costs that flow outside your business. They serve only to inflate revenue. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Labor efficiency is clearly defined. </I>Because direct labor and management labor are isolated, rather than mixed with other costs, we can see productivity relationships to measure labor <I class=calibre8>output</I>, not minimize labor as a cost unless it is nonproductive. The addition of productive labor grows a business. Direct labor is held responsible against gross margin, while management labor is held responsible against contribution margin. I will discuss labor efficiency in Chapter 8. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Allocations are eliminated. </I>I am not a fan of allocations in the overall view of financials. I can see that it is necessary in segment reporting to spread certain shared revenue and costs, but I want to show labor that is not loaded for payroll taxes and benefits, nor do I want operating expenses (or overhead) allocated to cost of goods sold or labor. The omission of allocations saves my team time because they do not have to make the adjustments. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>It includes an output number called contribution margin that is the critical number in a business model. </I>My experience with modeling hundreds of businesses has shown that if I know contribution margin dollars, I can model up to revenue and down to net income. It also adds an additional benefit to share with your team. Since it is based on gross wages and gross margin, your team can <A id=calibre_link-66 class=calibre4></A>easily grasp the output of labor concept. They may not like it if their output measure is poor, but you have to address the truth to make improvements.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>The Simple Numbers summary has multiple views to further expand its usefulness. Unfortunately, these views can be generated only in spreadsheets unless you have a good coder or an accounting system with a robust reporting package. Even though these views are simple templates in our spreadsheet models, accounting systems have not made it easy for companies to reproduce them.</P>
<P class=noindent>The views in our Simple Numbers summary are as follows:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Year over year. </I>We start with rolling 12, then move to rolling 3, then finally show monthly. For shorter-term information, I always prefer rolling 3 over monthly. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Last 3 months. </I>Once again, we start with rolling 12. If you look at rolling 12 for the past three months and see it going up every month, real growth is taking place. Conversely, if it is falling, it is a major red flag that needs to be addressed quickly. After rolling 12, we look at rolling 3 and then monthly. The idea is to look at the longest data set first, work our way to the shortest, and not overreact to short-term data. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Year to date. </I>The year-to-date view is good only for estimating taxes. Otherwise, it is an invalid time period for analysis. My own company is a good example. In the year-to-date view we look great through October, then fall off the rest of the year. Most companies lose their butt in the last two months of the year, but we do not look at it that way in our own firm. We always try to beat last year&#8217;s November and December, and that always makes our rolling 12 go up!</LI></UL>
<P class=scl><A id=calibre_link-36 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Simple Numbers Case Example</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>The example described here is adapted example data that occurred live on a consulting call. We did the analysis on the fly to provide the client with financial clarity about their ongoing operations and to set launch capital spending targets, which are embedded in the operating data.</P>
<P class=noindent>The call started by looking at the company&#8217;s rolling-12 performance at the end of September over the past three years (table 6.5).</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-79 class=calibre>

<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00025.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-123 class=calibre4></A>As we reviewed their performance over the past three years, we could see that revenue increased in the current year (it was flat the previous year), and profit steadily declined to less than half of what it had been. The revenue increase in 20X3 was largely due to price increases we pushed for due to rising costs. Just a 1% decrease in gross margin impacted the bottom line in 20X2 since total operating expenses did not move. The market does not always give you room for a price increase, but when this company increased its prices, their customers did not notice too much.</P>
<P class=noindent>The company was in the later stages of expanding their capacity, so we needed to dig deeper to create a picture of how the existing business was performing and also identify all the launch capital spending that was already seeping into their current operating data. We also needed to identify the annual effect of the price changes, since they had been in effect for only three months. You can see the benefit of rolling 3 data in table 6.6.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-286 class=calibre>

<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00021.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-37 class=calibre4></A>Not every business has consistent activity in every quarter, but when you do have consistency (or a limited seasonal business cycle), rolling 3 is a powerful pacing tool to show a shorter-term picture of your business performance. From this case example, we immediately learned from the company&#8217;s rolling 3 data that they hit a new high in contribution margin and its percentage to sales. Like I said earlier, contribution margin is <I class=calibre8>the </I>critical number because it shows the productive output of the business engine, and it gives you more choice about what to spend your operating expenses on.</P>
<P class=noindent>After we spotted this company&#8217;s encouraging trend, we then extrapolated it to an annual number (see table 6.7) and evaluated it from there.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-76 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-354 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Table 6.7</B></H2>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Launch capital for expansion: Annualized evaluation</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00031.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-38 class=calibre4></A>By annualizing the quarter, we saw that the price increase had put the company on its best contribution margin path. Now we could focus on the operating expenses. By annualizing them, we could see the following:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Facilities expense was up because of spending on the new expansion. 
<LI class=calibre11>Marketing expense was up for the cost of announcing the expanded capacity to customers. 
<LI class=calibre11>The increase in management labor reflected hiring new staff members that would not otherwise have been needed. 
<LI class=calibre11>The increase in other operating expenses included consulting fees of $50,000 for the expansion. The increase in total operating expenses was $690,000, which was purely for the new capacity. If the company had not started the expansion process and just raised prices, they would have netted $1,068,881 in profit (or maybe more, without the distraction).</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>It would not have been enough for us to tell the company only how much they would have made. They also needed to know that their new profit target, after the expansion was open, had to incorporate the 50% return on the expenses that were hiding in the profit-and-loss statement. Since they spent $690,000, their profit target for next year would be $345,000 higher. If all went according to plan, they would be looking at net profit of $1,657,987 after the new capacity had been online for a full year. Otherwise, they would have to question their strategy or their execution of the growth plans. I had the utmost confidence that this company could meet or exceed that target.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-112 class=calibre4></A>Traditional accounting reporting was not designed for this level of insight. You need to have a clear understanding of what costs support your ongoing business and develop a way to tag spending in every major category that you determine was not needed to maintain the current business. By default, that is what you are betting your profits on. This is totally different from retaining profits to fund increases in trade capital or repay debt. When you use profit to fund those elements, you can get your money back by reborrowing the debt you paid or collecting the receivable you funded. But when you make an expense bet, or what I call a catalytic spend, when your growth plan fails to launch, there is no getting your money back. When you put your money on the roulette wheel and the spin does not go your way, the pit boss is not going to give you your money back and let you try again.</P>
<P class=scl><B class=calibre5>Accounting Techniques for Longer-Term Launch</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>The sure way every accounting system can account for launch capital is to have specific general ledger accounts set up for those costs and tag them as they are incurred. Most systems have divisional accounting capability, and you can set up launch capital as a division. Otherwise you need to make a good enough monthly estimate of what the discretionary spend was and track it offline, like we do in the custom forecast models we run for our clients.</P>
<P class=noindent>Another approach we are using for a software development client is to track all the labor and contractor costs on their balance sheet during the prelaunch phase of the software. This allows us to see the cumulative investment and feel the pressure build up to see what the final status will look like; then we can either get the software launched or stop development if we see that it costs considerably more than anticipated. We can also adjust our tax estimate planning, since most of that cost can be deducted in the year it is spent.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-227 class=calibre4></A>This is a great example of how to not let tax thinking drive your mindset. At the same time, it is beneficial to deduct the cost of building or expanding a product or service, to lower your cash outflow by the same amount as the tax benefit. But remember: it is never a good idea to spend a dollar to save 40 cents in tax! Spend only on things you believe will be more profitable than the amount of your investment.

<P class=sc><I class=calibre8>A man who aims at nothing hits it<BR class=calibre9>with amazing accuracy!</I></P>
<P class=center>&#8211; Greg Crabtree</P>
<P class=noindent1a>Throughout my accounting career, I always cringed at the sound of the word &#8220;budget.&#8221; It probably goes all the way back to growing up on the farm. My mom was the finance person, and my dad was the farmer. I do not remember my mom ever keeping a budget, but she always had a plan for how to build and move forward. Her plan even factored into how she sent me to college. I had a checkbook with no balance written in, just an instruction for me to spend only what I needed. When I came home every two weeks, I would transfer the checks I wrote into her checkbook and account for my actions.</P>
<P class=noindent>This technique may not work for every college student. Even though my mom weighed only 100 pounds and had red hair and freckles, I did not want to get her mad, and I also wanted to earn her respect by being responsible. I often say that budgets are a license to spend and that planning and forecasts are tools of growth and profitability. In Chapter 10 I will explain my alternative process for budgeting.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-92 class=calibre4></A>Our planning process always starts with establishing a target. A target is one specifically defined goal you want to reach. In contrast, a forecast is when you plan ahead and predict a course. Planning processes usually fall short in one of these two ways:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>You make a plan for the year but do not take into account the ramping effect of what you are currently doing. If your plan is to increase sales by 10%, it will take time to reach that number as your new sales initiatives roll out. You might fall short of 10% in the first half of the year, so your sales will have to increase by 12% to 15% in the last half of the year to average out to 10% overall. If you do not consider ramp-up time, you will be constantly disappointed in your planning. 
<LI class=calibre11>You build your plan for the year on a monthly incremental basis, but you miss the bigger opportunity of stopping activities that are unproductive because you are always thinking in increments.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>You can negate these shortcomings if you first establish a target you want to attain within one to two years and then build a forecast to get there. Do not be bound by calendar or fiscal years; give yourself the freedom of the rolling 12 view. Once you establish a picture of what you want your target to look like, you can build a weekly, monthly, and quarterly plan for how to get from here to there. If this is January and it will take 15 months to reach your target, then your rolling 12 around March of next year will tell you if your forecast hit your target. If you can hit your target sooner, great! If it takes longer, that is fine as long as your plan is still realistic and still takes you where you want to go.</P>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-213 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>The Forecasting and Targeting Process</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Over the years I have seen that the forecast models developed by our clients, or by other consultants, are usually lacking in one or more of these areas:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Forecast has too many details and levels. 
<LI class=calibre11>Forecast accounts for only profit and loss. 
<LI class=calibre11>Forecast time period is based on a year and is not rolling. 
<LI class=calibre11>Model does not allow for easy updating throughout the year.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>In addition, the balance sheet and cash flow report need to accomplish the following:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Reasonably predict accounts receivable, inventory (if applicable), accounts payable, term debt repayment, automatic withdrawals, and repayment of line of credit. 
<LI class=calibre11>Plan for quarterly estimated tax payments (for US businesses) or plan for taxes and a payment schedule (for international businesses). 
<LI class=calibre11>Plan for any shareholder dividends payments expected or driven from meeting performance goals.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>When we create our custom forecasting model for our clients, we make sure it can be updated with minimal effort by incorporating the following:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>We store the source data on one tab. 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-194 class=calibre4></A>Any presentation of data needed is on a separate tab that pulls from the source data, to avoid having to input data on the presentation tab. 
<LI class=calibre11>We do not use blank columns as spacers because they make it harder to copy data to the next column during updating. 
<LI class=calibre11>The current month of actual data can be dropped in and rolled forward with every month end close.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>My favorite tab we use in our model is aptly named the Thinking Model. Not only is this worksheet useful to set performance targets, but it is also a good tool for exploring what-if scenarios; setting minimum, target, and stretch performance levels; and verifying that if any new revenue growth occurs, it benefits the bottom line.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-183 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-355 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Thinking Model Example</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>The Thinking Model example in this section shows the last three years of actual performance data in our Simple Numbers analytical format. The example business is a services contractor that coordinates other contractors and materials. Each contract is worth $500,000 or more in revenue, and the revenue can swing wildly depending on the company&#8217;s success in winning contracts. The contracts usually take 6 to 12 months to complete, and the company recognizes revenue as costs are incurred on contracts.</P>
<P class=noindent>You can see in table 7.1 that revenue went down in year 2, yet the company&#8217;s direct labor costs stayed about the same. This is a great example of my launch capital concept, described in Chapter 6, because the company bet they could win the right contracts to increase revenue in year 3 if they increased their marketing spend (mainly bid and proposal costs) and beefed up their management team ahead of the awards to handle the significant increase in</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-228 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 7.1</B></P>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Thinking model: Years 1 through 3</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00010.jpeg"></P>
<P class=text1><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>* dLER is direct labor efficiency ratio. mLER is management labor efficiency ratio.</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-39 class=calibre4></A>volume. This was a bold move to say the least, but they were confident in their ability and had just enough cash and borrowing power to dig out of the year 2 hole. As we review their performance throughout this example, we will keep track to see if their launch capital spend met the 50% return standard.</P>
<P class=noindent>Notice in table 7.1 that direct labor stayed essentially the same from year 1 to year 2. This was a strategic decision that is hard for entrepreneurs to make. They had built a team of employees they wanted to keep, and the company believed they would need the team in year 3. If they had trimmed their staff to keep in line with year 1 performance, they would have cut direct labor by $291,250 to get their direct labor efficiency ratio (dLER) up to $3.20&#8212;that is, $3.20 of gross margin for every direct labor dollar spent&#8212;which was their performance in year 1. This demonstrates the two labor plays in business: you either flex the labor to what you sell, or you sell to cover your committed labor level. The business in this example committed to their labor level and increased sales to cover it, which took a year. Since the sales to cover the excess labor did not occur in the same year, their overspending of labor essentially became launch capital. They did not <I class=calibre8>have </I>to spend this money; they <I class=calibre8>chose </I>to spend it.</P>
<P class=noindent>The next increase you can see in table 7.1 is marketing. The increase was due mostly to travel and contractor costs to assist in the bidding and proposal work. The increase of $75,000 from year 1 to year 2 is launch capital because it was spent to move the business above the current revenue level.</P>
<P class=noindent>You can see in table 7.1 that the company&#8217;s management labor cost also increased; like direct labor, this increase was a choice, not a need. The company knew it would need to fill new leadership roles if they were to take the company to the next level. This addition of management labor is a critical point that I refer to as the black hole (see Chapter 6). Recall that the black hole is the <A id=calibre_link-216 class=calibre4></A>journey between $1 million and $5 million in revenue or gross margin in some circumstances. I have found that when gross margin is below 40%, it becomes the true top line of the business. For the example in table 7.1, the company&#8217;s gross margin percentage to sales was 30% or less&#8212;$4 million in year 1&#8212;and was their true top line. If you ever want to compare your business to another business in a different industry, use gross margin as the top line.</P>
<P class=noindent>The company realized they had cheated the management labor bucket in getting to a gross margin of $4 million in year 1. They knew they would need to rebuild their management team to get to the next level, dropping some team members who could not grow further in their roles and adding key team members to cover tasks that had previously been part-time responsibilities of overworked leaders. This is the best way to traverse the black hole. The fix is not quick, and it often carries the pain of a losing year, even if you get it right; it could take a couple of years if you get it wrong.</P>
<P class=noindent>For launch capital purposes, the catalytic spend (or bet) on additional management labor in year 2 was $325,000 (table 7.1). The company did not need that increase to maintain where they were, so the total increase included raises, bonuses, and new people minus employees who left. I generally do not include the increases in payroll tax and benefits, since this cost is a reaction to the new management labor spend, but you would not be wrong if you wanted to include it.</P>
<P class=noindent>Other operating expenses also increased due to some one-time consultants who helped with the transition, so another $50,000 is added to the launch capital tally.</P>
<P class=noindent>Let&#8217;s recap the launch capital spends in year 2 (table 7.1):</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Direct labor cost exceeded the company&#8217;s need by $291,250. 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-40 class=calibre4></A>Marketing increased by $75,000. 
<LI class=calibre11>Management labor increased by $325,000. 
<LI class=calibre11>The increase in other operating expenses included $50,000 in consulting fees. 
<LI class=calibre11>The total launch capital spend in year 2 was $741,250. Therefore, the minimum increase in profit needed from year 1 to year 3, at 50%, is $370,625.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Let&#8217;s evaluate the company&#8217;s launch capital spend in year 2. They invested $741,250, and the profit increased from $955,000 in year 1 to $1,955,000 in year 3, an increase of $1,000,000. To measure the return, take the increase in profit of $1,000,000 and divide it by the cost of $741,250 to get the annual return of 135%. This company placed a risky bet, but it definitely paid off! These are the kinds of risks entrepreneurs take all the time to grow their business and create wealth. Incremental bets throughout the life of the business are far more critical to its success than any initial investment.</P>
<P class=noindent>Before we set the company&#8217;s next performance target, there are a few things to note on year 3 in table 7.1:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Gross margin. </I>Gross margin as a percentage to sales increased to 30% from 27%. In this case, the change is neither good nor bad, since it is essentially pass-through costs. They are not controlled by the company, but rather by the customer as stated in the contract. The change would matter if the company controlled the source or the price, or if they had to pay the costs before they get paid by their customer. The company is not focused on revenue at all; they are focused on gross margin dollars. 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-230 class=calibre4></A><I class=calibre8>Direct labor</I>. You can see that dLER dropped from $3.20 in year 1 to $3.10 in year 3. This represents a potential opportunity for margin improvement in the future if the company can return to a better performance level, which we will model and quantify in the next section. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Management labor efficiency. </I>Management labor efficiency (mLER) hit a new high at $3.75 and is a new company standard that helps establish a salary cap for new management hires, and it establishes a ceiling for raises and bonuses. In the next section I will discuss how to use this key performance indicator to hold your management team accountable for true economic output. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Operating expenses</I>. We look at operating expenses as a percentage to their relative measure. At the bottom of table 7.1 you can see we measure facilities and other operating expenses against contribution margin; marketing against revenue; and payroll tax and benefits against all labor. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Facilities costs. </I>These are gradually increasing. Since most facilities costs are fixed, be aware of significant spending like adding new space that is more expensive. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Marketing and payroll tax and benefits</I>. These have settled into a stable pattern and can be predicted by the historical percentage unless the company&#8217;s activity changes relative to these categories. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Other operating expenses. </I>This a catchall bucket for business costs. You can see that they normalized as a percentage of contribution margin in year 3 after the down year.</LI></UL>
<DIV class=box>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-41 class=calibre13></A><B class=calibre5>Lagging Variable Cost</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>I refer to other operating expenses as a lagging variable cost. If the company experiences a downturn, you cannot simply shut off these expenses; similarly, they do not immediately increase when the company grows. These expenses often lag six months to a year.</P>
<P class=noindent>I have never found it helpful to forecast at the line item level. If a client uses line items, I can usually beat their accuracy by using a percentage and identifying which discretionary decisions in this cost pool will be significantly different.</P></DIV>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Setting the Next Target: Levels of Attainment</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Most entrepreneurs continually look for next year&#8217;s target, but remember that you can use the targeting process described in this chapter any time you need to make a business change to capture an opportunity or to correct underperformance. My preferred approach is to view these targets as levels of attainment&#8212;which I call the minimum, target, and stretch levels&#8212;that could occur on a rolling 12 basis in any given month. Through monthly forecasting, you can have an idea of when you might hit the targets, but we all know that sometimes plans do not turn out as expected. If you use the minimum, target, and stretch levels to drive bonus plans, the levels will generally be dependent on time, but you could establish a one-time bonus when a key level is hit on a rolling 12.</P>
<P class=noindent>To establish a working area in the Thinking Model, we will take the lessons we learned from the past three years of performance. We look for the company&#8217;s best data points, then establish our planned performance levels.</P>
<P class=scl><A id=calibre_link-195 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Setting the Minimum Level</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>We start with setting the minimum level of attainment. For illustration, table 7.2 shows only year 3, which is carried over from table 7.1.</P>
<P class=noindent>This plan is developed using the Simple Numbers bottom-up targeting process. After studying how entrepreneurs really think, we learned that most of them start with what they want to spend money on and work up from there. The most common thing they want to spend money on is labor to get the job done.</P>
<P class=noindent>Tables 7.2 and 7.3 break down each step in the following bottomup targeting process, but in practice this is all done at one time. The results from the steps are inserted into table 7.3, which contains columns for the minimum, target, and stretch levels of attainment. The calculations occur in the following order:</P>
<P class=no>1. Identify the management team&#8217;s annual wages and, from history, establish the mLER you want to hold them accountable to.</P>
<P class=no>2. From table 7.2, multiply the management labor contribution margin times mLER to get the contribution margin for the minimum column in table 7.3.</P>
<P class=no>3. Once contribution margin is established, we estimate direct labor needs.</P>
<P class=noa>a. Determine the expected level of dLER. For the minimum level, I usually set it at the previous year&#8217;s level unless there are anomalies that impact it either way. In our example, we set the minimum level the same as year 3; that is, $3.10.</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-42 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 7.2</B></P>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Thinking Model: Working area for targeting process</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00016.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noa>b. We know both contribution margin and dLER, so from table 7.3 in the minimum column, the formula to calculate direct labor dollars is contribution margin divided by (dLER minus 1.00):<BR class=calibre9><BR class=calibre9><B class=calibre6>$5,625,000 / (3.10 &#8211; 1.00) = $2,678,571</B><BR class=calibre9><BR class=calibre9><A id=calibre_link-169 class=calibre4></A>That is the hardest math I will make you do! Just remember to solve inside the parentheses first, then solve the rest of the equation.</P>
<P class=no>4. Gross margin (minimum column in table 7.3) is found by adding direct labor and contribution margin.<BR class=calibre9><BR class=calibre9><B class=calibre6>$2,678,571.43 + $5,625,000.00 = $8,303,571.43</B><BR class=calibre9><BR class=calibre9>Gross margin is assumed to remain the same until we see it move. As I said before, it is more important to build a target based on gross margin dollars, regardless of revenue; however, I agree that the minimum level of gross margin percentage needs to be acceptable.</P>
<P class=no>5. Revenue is simply gross margin dollars divided by gross margin as a percentage to sales (table 7.3, minimum column).<BR class=calibre9><BR class=calibre9><B class=calibre6>$8,303,571.43 / 0.3 = $27,678,571.43</B></P>
<P class=no>6. Once you know revenue, labor, and contribution margin, you predict operating expenses based on percentages (shown at the bottom of tables 7.2 and 7.3); the exception is facilities, which I usually estimate since it changes only by choice.</P>

<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-226 class=calibre4></A>Now that you have a grasp of how the math works and its sequence in a single attainment level, we can explore how all three levels work together. But before we move on to the target level, let&#8217;s review some key points about establishing the minimum level:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>The minimum level is usually carried over from the prior year. 
<LI class=calibre11>You would rarely establish a minimum level that is below the prior year unless there are challenges you cannot control, such as the loss of a key contract or customer without an identified replacement, or if a key employee or group of employees leaves and their departure reduces your potential output or sales volume. 
<LI class=calibre11>If you know that the current momentum of your business will carry you higher, you might need to establish the minimum level higher than the prior year. To use a basketball term, there is no need for a lay-up in the planning process.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-280 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-356 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Setting the Target Level</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Your major focus should be on setting the target level. Ideally, your target level will be a blend of what you already have in place, the expected outcome of key initiatives you have defined with and assigned to your team, priorities that can reasonably be accomplished, and business results realized during the planning year.</P>
<P class=noindent>Here are the key points in the target level column of table 7.3:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The mLER increases to 4.00 while management labor dollars stay constant. </I>The thinking here is that the investment in new management labor increased the capacity for handling further growth. This tells <A id=calibre_link-231 class=calibre4></A>the management team that even though there was good performance in year 3, the company was still paying for the future and had not achieved optimal performance. In the team&#8217;s celebration of rebounding in year 3 (see table 7.1), it is easy for them to feel that they have earned their pay and deserve more, while you think they have not yet fully delivered on what you are already paying them for. 
<UL class=calibre16>
<LI class=calibre11>Pay should chase performance whenever possible. It is easy to get pulled into paying before you see demonstrated performance. This always happens with a new hire, since they are unproven, but you should always avoid paying ahead for existing team members. The exception is promotions; you do not know ahead of time if the promoted person can handle their new role.<BR class=calibre9><BR class=calibre9>When you set the desired target for mLER, ask yourself if your current team can produce at this level and not expect to get additional labor dollars to spend on new hires, raises, or bonuses. If you believe they can, you have to overtly set that expectation; be prepared for pushback because they will naturally want more as they produce more. Your argument here is that you pay a market-based wage for market performance. By paying a market-based wage, as confirmed by wage surveys and other market sources, then setting market performance levels through planning, you can help temper your team&#8217;s pay expectations.</LI></UL>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The dLER holds steady at $3.10 from year 3.</I> Entrepreneurs often ask me what a good labor efficiency ratio is. I usually tell them the answer is in <A id=calibre_link-174 class=calibre4></A>their own data. If you look at your company history, you can usually find a time when your company hit a record in its rate of performance. I mostly look only at rolling 12 data to find the record, but sometimes I have to look at rolling 3 to see what is possible if underperformance is not a seasonal issue and rather a lack of focus and performance. In table 7.3, we did not increase the dLER, since the company was still growing into its new labor. We postponed the increase to the stretch level. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Gross margin as a percentage to sales holds at the most recent historical percentage. </I>I never change the gross margin percentage unless there is a demonstrated trend or an action that we know will impact it. This is where gross margin thinking comes in handy. Some of our most successful clients have finally eliminated the word &#8220;revenue&#8221; from their vocabulary. It is not about revenue dollars, it is all about gross margin dollars. These same clients have removed all incentives based on revenue and replaced them with either contribution margin or gross margin. 
<UL class=calibre16>
<LI class=calibre11>My preference is to base sales incentives on contribution margin since it comes after direct labor has been applied. Salespeople complain that they do not have control over direct labor, but I say they do. They need to get to know the direct labor team and make sure they sell what the team does best, not sell stuff just to make a commission. Conversely, the direct labor team needs to spend time with the salespeople to let them know what the team does best because, if the salespeople do not sell those things, the direct labor team starves! 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-44 class=calibre4></A>If I cannot win my argument on contribution margin, gross margin is my next preferred sales incentive basis. If I cannot specifically calculate cost of goods sold (COGS) on each sale, I will still use gross margin and apply a trailing calculation of gross margin to keep salespeople focused on not using price alone in their sales negotiations.</LI></UL>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Other operating expenses are handled the same in the target level as in the minimum level. </I>The only possible increase is if the marketing spend needs to go up as a percentage to revenue, depending on how much of a revenue increase you project. In table 7.3, no additional marketing budget is needed to accomplish revenue goals; the increased amount reflects what is needed to increase the effectiveness of the marketing efforts. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The revenue increase of $1,845,238 is the result of our bottom-up technique. </I>This is where we evaluate the work output and see if it is reasonable and meets our goals. In this case, it hits what the company felt was available in the market and what their marketing plans could reasonably bring in during the year. If the revenue number were off, the first adjustment would be to move mLER up or down as needed. If it produced a net income less than your desired target, you might even look at reducing management labor by eliminating poor performers or unneeded roles. It is not uncommon to overhire in a growth phase, thinking you need certain roles, only to discover later that the role was not needed or could be combined with another role.</LI></UL>
<P class=scl><A id=calibre_link-45 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Setting the Stretch Level</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Now that we have established the minimum and target performance levels, we move to the stretch level. This reflects what could theoretically happen, but the likelihood falls into the 25% to 50% range. I am not a fan of making the stretch level so high that there is no reasonable chance of it happening.</P>
<P class=noindent>The main parameters we normally use are as follows (see table 7.3):</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The mLER moves up to $4.25, and the management labor dollars increase by $200,000, which raises contribution margin by $1,225,000</I>. If you surpass this target, you will need to give bonuses or raises, or you will need to add supporting labor. I prefer to design bonus plans that include these payouts in the performance target that has to be reached, or set the target high enough that the company still keeps money after the bonus is paid. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Direct labor and dLER go up. </I>I set the dLER target back to the historical best of $3.20 (year 1 in table 7.1), which will lower the direct labor needed if there is not a revenue increase. Since we raised mLER to $4.25 and added management labor, we need to add $426,948 of direct labor to support the contribution margin volume. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>All operating expense percentages stay constant (bottom of table 7.3) because there are no conditions that warrant changing them. </I>There could be a small increase in facilities, unless you add space, but resist trimming any of the other operating expense percentages until you see them drop on a rolling 12 basis for several months. For most businesses we work with, there are not enough areas you can cut in these buckets and remain sustainable; however, there are a few exceptions that will go away, like high-cost consulting. 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-90 class=calibre4></A><I class=calibre8>The net results for the stretch level are revenue of $35 million and net income of $3.2 million.</I></LI></UL></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-275 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-357 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Evaluating the Plan</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>We have considered various scenarios, done the math, and developed a new plan that looks great on paper, but is it realistic? To answer that question, we need to look at several areas.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-21 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-358 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Market Maturity</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Is the company in our example facing a mature market for their product or service in their designated service area? Table 7.1 shows the company jumped to a reasonable level of market maturity with their growth from year 2 to year 3. In year 3 they will be more focused on maintaining what they have, with some incremental improvement, until they define their next major market move. If your company is in the midst of a major growth initiative, this would not demonstrate enough growth between levels.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-20 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-359 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Performance and Efficiency</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Is the company maintaining its performance and improving in labor efficiency ratio measures? The number one way to make more profit is to improve how you leverage both direct labor and management labor. This company&#8217;s plan accomplishes improvement in both, but there is only marginal improvement in direct labor. Once you pass $5 million in direct labor, it becomes harder to see significant changes in dLER without a major overhaul of processes. In the example, the company is planning only minor improvements in dLER that can usually be accomplished with improved focus.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-261 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-360 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Return on Invested Capital</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>What is the company&#8217;s return on invested capital (ROIC)? This is the real question to determine how good a plan is. The full cash <A id=calibre_link-166 class=calibre4></A>flow forecast model gives you that number, but I will show you how to calculate the elements of invested capital here.</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Trade capital. </I>You can use several calculations to figure trade capital. 
<UL class=calibre16>
<LI class=calibre11>Using the historical estimate of days in accounts receivable (AR), you can predict the average AR you will have to carry at the given revenue level:<BR class=calibre9><BR class=calibre9><B class=calibre6>AR / 365 = Day of sales</B><BR class=calibre9><BR class=calibre9><B class=calibre6>Day of sales x Days of AR = Average AR</B> 
<LI class=calibre11>Using the historical average of day of accounts payable (AP), you can calculate an estimate of AP:<BR class=calibre9><BR class=calibre9><B class=calibre6>Annual COGS / 365 = Day of COGS</B><BR class=calibre9><BR class=calibre9><B class=calibre6>Day of COGS x Days in AP = Average AP support from vendors</B> 
<LI class=calibre11>Other trade capital elements that could be present are assets you have to fund (inventory, work in progress, prepaid job expenses) and liabilities that help reduce asset carry (deferred revenue, customer deposits, accrued expenses).</LI></UL>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Infrastructure capital</I>. This is the simplest type of capital because you estimate the net book value of fixed assets and intangible assets, and subtract the debt that is directly associated with them. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Buffer capital</I>. This is the core capital target concept I discussed in my previous book, <I class=calibre8>Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits! </I>A fully capitalized business is one that <A id=calibre_link-46 class=calibre4></A>has no line of credit balance that is funding AR or inventory, plus the business has two months of operating expenses and labor in cash. Essentially, it is anything a company does not get terms on. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Launch capital</I>. There is no launch capital for the planning year since we are not making any discretionary spending bets, like we did in year 2.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>The capital calculations for our example company are shown in table 7.4, along with the resulting ROIC for the minimum, target, and stretch levels we developed in table 7.3.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-253 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-361 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Table 7.4</B></H2>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Capital calculations and ROIC for minimum, target, and stretch levels</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00033.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-167 class=calibre4></A>You can see that the company is meeting my minimum ROIC standard of 50% at all three levels of their plan, ranging from 74% to 90%. Why would you not keep enough cash in this business to protect an <I class=calibre8>annual </I>return of 74% to 90%? The tricky part is whether this business is growing at those return levels without taking too much risk. Owning your own business and effectively balancing its growth and profit strategies is one of the best ways to build wealth, but there is nothing easy or automatic about it!</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Leveraging $1 of Management Labor</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>When we complete a targeting session, the last thing I bring into focus for the client&#8217;s management team is how much revenue they need to add for every added dollar of management labor. Most companies fixate on the leverage of their direct labor, which is important; but the leverage on management labor separates great businesses from the rest.</P>
<P class=noindent>To illustrate this point, let&#8217;s go back to our example company and three key metrics from the target level (table 7.3).</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>mLER is $4.00. 
<LI class=calibre11>dLER is $3.10. 
<LI class=calibre11>Gross margin as a percentage to sales is 30%.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Now we can make the following calculation:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>$1 of management labor times mLER is $4.00 of contribution margin. 
<LI class=calibre11>$4 of contribution margin divided by (dLER minus 1) is $1.90 of direct labor.<BR class=calibre9><BR class=calibre9><B class=calibre6>$4 / ($3.10 &#8211; 1) = $1.90</B> 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-168 class=calibre4></A>Contribution margin of $4 plus direct labor of $1.90 is $5.90 of gross margin. 
<LI class=calibre11>Gross margin of $5.90 divided by 30% is $19.66!</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>For every dollar of management labor added in this business (a raise, a bonus, or a new body), the company will need to add $19.66 of revenue to stay at the same rate of profitability, given that the key metrics stay the same.</P>
<P class=noindent>This is an example of how the term &#8220;scaling&#8221; is often misapplied. In some businesses, the founder thinks that costs will stay constant or go down as the business grows. While this can be true up to $5 million in revenue, it is rarely true past that level except in a few rare business models. More commonly, you lose margin as you grow and have to compete with the major market players. ROIC is what scales; it gets better as you grow because most elements of your capital signature get more efficient if they are managed properly. Scaling is more about market penetration than improved margins with growth. If your operating margins get better as you surpass $5 million, you are in a special class.</P>
<P class=noindent>The example company in this chapter has a low gross margin (i.e., 40% or below), and recall that I look at gross margin as the true top line of the business for this level of gross margin. You can see that it takes almost $6 of gross margin for every dollar of added management labor. I have done this calculation countless times. For businesses with a higher gross margin, it comes out in a range of $6 to $10 for revenue. If the company&#8217;s gross margin is below 40%, it hits the same range for gross margin dollars. It always shocks people to see this, and it gives them a new perspective on why they need to hold management more accountable to deliver contribution margin, not just revenue.

<P class=noindent1a>Since I created the Simple Numbers approach to analyzing data, I have become associated with the term &#8220;labor efficiency ratio,&#8221; affectionately known as LER. It has become a key diagnostic and management tool for those who adopt it. Like all tools, it can take time to master, but it has proven to be effective at keeping track of productivity for both direct and management labor.</P>
<P class=noindent>In my first book, <I class=calibre8>Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!</I>, I talked about overall LER, which is gross margin divided by all labor. This measure can be effective for businesses under $5 million in revenue that do not have a clear distinction of what is direct labor and what is management labor. Also, when I wrote my previous book, I had not completed enough sample data sets in which we broke out direct labor and management labor to confidently report on how to separate them. Since then, we have divided LER into the two types of labor with all our clients; we have even taken LER down to the segment reporting level with great effectiveness.</P>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-232 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Uniqueness of LER in Financial Analysis</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>There is a good reason for why you will never see LER in a public company&#8217;s financial statement. They do not want you to see labor broken out by type because you would be able to identify the most critical aspect of their business management strategy (for better or worse). If there is any mention of labor in the financial statement, it focuses on some portion of labor, but it is typically hidden in other costs.</P>
<P class=sca><I class=calibre14>Labor should never be mixed with another cost.<BR class=calibre9>It is the only cost that comes to work<BR class=calibre9>every day with an attitude!</I></P>
<P class=noindent>When we did our original research, it became painfully obvious that labor dollars measured against some form of margin was a more intuitively correct analysis than measuring bodies per revenue dollar. A CEO can always make a quick change to make the labor ratio look better by slashing the lowest end of the pay spectrum, but that is usually not where the fix is needed. We also homed in on a point that every business owner should understand: labor must be broken out and never mixed with a nonlabor cost, because it is the only cost that comes to work every day with an attitude! Labor is a variable output cost that largely depends on your management skill, strategy, and sometimes your willpower!</P></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-362 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>LER Formulas and Labor Divisions</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Recall the following ratios we have been using throughout this book:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Direct labor efficiency ratio (dLER) = Gross margin divided by direct labor 
<LI class=calibre11>Management labor efficiency ratio (mLER) = Contribution margin divided by management labor</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-189 class=calibre4></A>We do not use revenue as a numerator, due to the pass-through nature of cost of goods sold (COGS). Since COGS can vary by business model and by customer interaction, using revenue as the numerator does not allow for accurate comparison. Gross margin is the first dollar you can spend internally; therefore, it is the true top line of your business and should be used to hold direct labor accountable for performance.</P>
<P class=noindent>This brings up an interesting challenge for your sales team. They must focus on gross margin and contribution margin, not revenue. Otherwise they put unbearable pressure on your labor to perform without enough margin. I want my sales team to sell what we do best, not just sell anything they can and always default to price adjustments to win the deal. Granted, the sales team does not control labor, but they cannot ignore it in pricing and sell the impossible.</P>
<P class=noindent>Management labor must focus on three variables:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Drive revenue 
<LI class=calibre11>Control COGS (pass-through costs) 
<LI class=calibre11>Manage direct labor</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Management is an active function, not simply a position. When someone wants to move from daily production to management, it is often code for wanting more money and authority over people, instead of the desire to commit to a management role. In the old days of layered management, these types of positions existed, but they were the first to get cut in a layoff. In today&#8217;s flat management structure, there is no place for passive management roles if the company wants to be a top performer.</P>
<P class=noindent>How do you create a distinction between direct labor and management labor? I start by identifying the personnel who are <A id=calibre_link-218 class=calibre4></A>direct labor, then management labor is everybody else. As long as your methodology is consistent, your data will be good. Beware of comparing your company to the industry as a whole or any benchmark data unless you know how the numbers are compiled. Your best guidance lies within your own data. Set your own performance standards instead of measuring yourself against someone who might be running a different strategy.</P>
<P class=noindent>While you consider which staff members are direct labor, keep these points in mind:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Customer-facing team members are direct labor. 
<LI class=calibre11>People who sell or deliver products or services are direct labor. 
<LI class=calibre11>If a person has a split role&#8212;partially direct labor and partially management&#8212;do not split the person. We call this the butt-in-a-bucket approach. A person is either all direct labor or all management. If they spend 50% or more of their time doing what your business does, they are direct labor. 
<LI class=calibre11>If your own role will eventually be all management, classify yourself as management labor and try to delegate your direct labor duties to minimize those tasks. 
<LI class=calibre11>In professional service firms, we classify all billable personnel as direct labor. I am considered direct labor because I spend about 45% of my time facing the customer. I would give up my CEO role before I would give up my direct duties. Similarly, billable doctors, lawyers, and engineers are direct labor. 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-87 class=calibre4></A>If your company primarily sells stuff, your salespeople are direct labor, and your sales manager or VP is management labor. If your company primarily makes stuff and you employ a couple of people to sell what your direct labor produces, those salespeople go into management labor; they can be separately reported as a segment of management labor. 
<LI class=calibre11>Direct labor encompasses the total wages of employees. 
<LI class=calibre11>Do not separate their nonbillable or time-off costs into another line. Do not include payroll tax and benefits in wages. Control them as a separate pool of costs. The one exception is that some staffing companies include payroll tax because they have such a thin margin.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Once you have identified direct labor, then everybody else is management labor, including administrative support personnel.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Case Study: Aspire to Serve Inc.</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Now you know how to separate direct labor from management labor, so let&#8217;s look at a case study called Aspire to Serve Inc. (ATSi), with data set created from a blend of client experiences, and explore how to use LER.</P>
<P class=noindent>In table 8.1, the first thing you notice about ATSi is they are right in the middle of the black hole I have mentioned before; that is, the journey between $1 million and $5 million in revenue, which is usually filled with the greatest challenges. At $3 million in revenue, ATSi must choose a key strategy: either stretch their team as far as they can and then backfill, or invest in labor ahead of growth and trust their sales process and access to debt or capital to fund that growth.</P>

<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-48 class=calibre4></A>Most entrepreneurs have a tendency to grow their way out of their lack of profitability. We often refer to this as stage 1 of denial. Although growing is indeed a viable option to improve performance, experience tells us that most unprofitable businesses have some unproductive costs that need to be fixed first. Notice that I did not specifically say they need to cut costs. The amount they are spending for labor, or anything else, may be the correct amount; it may be that they are spending on the wrong source. A different person or vendor at the same cost might be more productive. My job is to educate entrepreneurs on their options, and they get to decide which approach they want to take.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=calibre_link-363 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Forecast and Year 2 Results</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>We engaged with ATSi just after the first quarter ended for year 2. Let&#8217;s look at the key highlights of their initial plan (table 8.1):</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>They forecasted 12% annual revenue growth over the previous year. 
<LI class=calibre11>Although they planned to spend fewer marketing dollars, they expected their efforts to be more effective, at 9.3% as a percentage to sales, if their sales growth materializes. 
<LI class=calibre11>The major plan to increase profit comes in the dLER ratio, which is expected to rise to $3.02 by keeping their labor cost flat and increasing revenue by 12%. That is not a bad strategy, as long as you have the right people in the right seats, and they have capacity. 
<LI class=calibre11>The company predicts a $100,000 reduction in operating expenses by trimming in a few places and increasing management labor, primarily to compensate the owner at a market wage and reduce their need for distributions. (A $50,000 increase was not enough to get them to market and get off distributions, but it was a start.) 
<LI class=calibre11>If their forecast comes to fruition, they would use all the profit to reduce their line of credit and improve their return <A id=calibre_link-49 class=calibre4></A>on invested capital (ROIC). They would not owe taxes, since they had an unused loss carrying over from year 1. (In this example, I am counting the line of credit as temporary capital, since it indicates they are undercapitalized by the amount due on their line of credit.) 
<LI class=calibre11>Assuming this forecast holds true, the line of credit balance will drop to $31,000 and cash will stay the same if there are no distributions and accounts receivable stays roughly the same at year end.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Let&#8217;s look at table 8.2 and see what happened!</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-292 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-364 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Table 8.2</B></H2>

<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00037.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-50 class=calibre4></A>Table 8.2 proves that business is a lot harder than putting numbers on a spreadsheet! Notice the following:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Although ATSi had the greatest of intentions, their annual revenue growth goal did not materialize. 
<LI class=calibre11>The company realized that some customers and service offerings were not profitable. They started trimming underperforming labor and cutting unprofitable customers, and they dropped some services that were losing money late in the year when they realized they did not have the right people in the right seats. You will see more of the labor trimming effect in year 3. 
<LI class=calibre11>While they made some modest improvement in operating expenses, they realized that you typically cannot cut enough costs to become profitable; you have to focus on not being wasteful.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>ATSi was expecting to make a profit in year 2, but instead they failed to implement the changes needed and had to fund a loss instead of having profit by following a three-pronged approach:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>They squeezed their cash down by $40,000. 
<LI class=calibre11>They used that $40,000 to pay down their line of credit so the bank would not think the loan was uncollectible (because the bank would worry, since you cannot repay a loan when you have losses). 
<LI class=calibre11>Instead of taking distributions, the owner made a capital contribution of $19,819.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>After reflecting on year 2, ATSi learned the following:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>A dLER of $3.25 would get them to breakeven, and $3.50 would get them to 10%. 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-51 class=calibre4></A>Their marketing spend may have missed the mark, but they would give it one more year at the same level and try to track more so they could correlate the results of their spending by channel. 
<LI class=calibre11>They were out of funding resources, so any cash shortfall would have to come from personal funds or borrowing from the owner personally. 
<LI class=calibre11>It would have been better to get profitable in year 1 rather than trying to grow out of a hole since they had limited access to funding for their launch capital.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-254 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-365 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Year 3 Foundation</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>ATSi is ready to move on to year 3 and put a foundation in place.</P>
<P class=noindent>Table 8.3 shows that ATSi is making progress! The key highlights of year 3 are as follows:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>It took the company until partway into the first quarter of year 3 to transition direct labor staff members who were ineffective. Then the company established a salary cap policy for hiring and raises that said no labor would be added unless dLER was $3.50 or better for that quarter. ATSi was fortunate that their revenues were consistent throughout the year, so they could see this on a quarterly basis. If their revenue had been seasonal, they would have needed to use a rolling 12 to control the salary cap. 
<LI class=calibre11>They determined that a significant portion of their marketing spend was ineffective. You will see an adjustment in year 4. 
<LI class=calibre11>Their operating expenses grew back to a similar level as in year 1. Trimming these costs is much like weeding a garden: it takes constant focus or they grow back; but this is not nearly as important as managing dLER.</LI></UL>

<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-53 class=calibre4></A>With only $25,000 in profit, there was not enough cash flow to meet the company&#8217;s obligations. The owner had to raise $105,482 through personal borrowing to help pay down the line of credit and keep the cash stable.</LI></UL>
<P class=scl><B class=calibre5>Progress in Years 4 through 7</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>The foundation was laid in year 3, so let&#8217;s look at ATSi&#8217;s successive years in table 8.4 and see their progress build.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-264 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-366 title="**Table 8.4**, ATSi years 4 through 7" class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Table 8.4</B></H2>
<H3 class=sigilnotintoc>ATSi years 4 through 7</H3>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt=""></P>
<P class=noindent>The highlights of year 4 are as follows:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-115 class=calibre4></A><I class=calibre8>Using a dLER of $3.50 to control hiring and raises, ATSi was finally able to hit 10% net income and a leveraged ROIC of 99%, but they still needed to pay off their line of credit.</I> 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The biggest change in operating expenses was their marketing spend, which fell by $124,000</I>. As a result, their revenue increased at a higher rate than in year 3, which had a greater marketing spend. Marketing expenses should be effective, but the challenge is tracking and measuring that effectiveness. ATSi tended to keep customers for multiple years, and they had overapplied the lifetime value of a customer concept to justify some of their marketing spend. The lifetime value of a customer can be a valid concept if you have a lot of cash to burn until you scale, but ATSi did not. When funding is limited, you first have to get profitable with what you have, then decide if you want to gamble with your after-tax profits and use the launch capital ideas described in Chapter 6. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The owner finally took a full market-based wage in year 4 and did not have to take distributions from that point forward to fund personal living expenses.</I> 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The distributions in year 4 were used to pay off the personal funding sources the owner contributed during years 2 and 3. </I>Since those were not long-term structured sources, they had a higher repayment priority than the business debt, which did get reduced some. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>No taxes were paid on the business profits, since ATSi was still carrying forward losses from prior years, but every dollar of profit would be taxed from this point forward.</I></LI></UL>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-54 class=calibre4></A>Things really started taking off in year 5. ATSi started to feel and see the benefits of their plan. Here are the highlights:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>With a dLER of no less that $3.50, you are still looking for the upper end of what is possible. </I>As you identify your brand standard and your team executes to that standard, you do not add labor until you have to. In year 5, ATSi set a new standard for what is possible, but sometimes their direct labor was functioning beyond capacity, or as we say, &#8220;running hot.&#8221; They knew they would need to add labor in the following year, but they could be patient and find the right new team members. ATSi found that a dLER of $3.50 gave them a steady state of operations and room to train new staff. If needed, they could temporarily run as high as $4.00, but that would not be sustainable for more than one year. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The mLER settled in at $5.00 or above. </I>This is usually the last metric to solidify, but it should remain constant or slightly improve from here. Until the shareholders are taking a full market wage, you cannot target the mLER rate. While dLER varies considerably from business to business, mLER seems to run from $3.50 to $4.00 for 10% profit performance, and it moves to $5.00 once you get above $5 million in revenue for the majority of businesses we see. ATSi was able to use an mLER of $5.00 as their salary cap for the management team from this point forward. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Facilities, payroll taxes, and other operating expenses had not changed drastically from year 1</I>. The costs from year 1 were really for the year 5 revenue support. These costs should scale relative to contribution margin from this point forward, with a slight lag in timing. They usually adjust one year after the next size level is attained. 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-55 class=calibre4></A><I class=calibre8>The company&#8217;s marketing effectiveness really improved, and they started to get a better feel of how to spend for impact. </I>By keeping the spend level the same as year 4, they were able to achieve 13% growth over that year and were poised to increase the spend, now that they had a better idea of what worked for the money invested. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The company profits soared, so they paid off their line of credit and had a company celebration! </I>Distributions were made only to cover taxes on profit that flowed through to the owner. They retained the rest of the cash to build their core capital target of two months of operating expenses in cash. For ATSi, that is $250,000 for one month and $500,000 for two months, so they ended the year almost at one month. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>ROIC soared to 147% with no leverage, but the company was still undercapitalized by one month of operating expenses. </I>The investment was finally starting to pay off!</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>ATSi&#8217;s success continued in year 6, and their profit climbed to 19%. The key highlights from year 6 are as follows:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Since their dLER ran above $4.00 in year 5, they took the pressure off by adding more employees, then the dLER dropped back to $3.76. </I>From here, the company needed to balance raises for their team against the cost of adding new personnel. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Operating expenses stayed in line with their operating ratios, and the additional marketing spend was a success in that it was proportional to the company&#8217;s growth.</I> 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Of the $765,000 in profit, about $500,000 was used for distributions</I>. That included $270,000 to cover taxes and $230,000 for an after-tax distribution to the owner. The <A id=calibre_link-113 class=calibre4></A>company did not see any investment opportunities that would meet the minimum 50% ROIC standard, so they built wealth outside the business. It feels good when you get a profit distribution as a tangible reward for your strategy. The remaining profit was used to increase cash, get to 1.5 months of core capital, increase accounts receivable, and purchase some minor fixed assets. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>ROIC came in at 138%, which is not too shabby!</I></LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Year 7 was the company&#8217;s best year ever, in terms of net income dollars and net income as a percentage to revenue. While the net results were outstanding, ATSi must stay mindful of certain trends to remain stable. Here are the highlights:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The dLER has fallen back to $3.49 because the company had to staff up quickly for a 20% growth year. </I>They expect dLER to fall back to $3.75 as the new team members get acclimated and fully trained. You can see that the dLER drop cost them 3% on contribution margin as a percentage to revenue. Also, part of the change was caused by increased wages for their existing team members so ATSi could stay competitive in a very tough labor market. The company will probably need to increase their prices soon to get dLER back to $3.75 because efficiency alone cannot overcome rising wages. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The mLER continues to rise, but ATSi will likely need to add more members to the management team as they cross the $5 million threshold and exit the black hole. </I>They will be able to add that labor and stay above their $5.00 mLER target. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The company&#8217;s marketing effectiveness continues to shine. </I>Their spend was held at about 6% to sales, and they added 20% in new revenue. It is imperative to track marketing effectiveness this way so you can give effective feedback to the person in charge of spending. 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-56 class=calibre4></A><I class=calibre8>Operating expenses continue to lag revenue growth, but those expenses typically take a year to respond. </I>Their percentage to revenue dropped significantly this year because the company had a big growth year, so they expect some of those costs to rise in the following year. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The profit was used for distributions of $753,286, which includes $364,700 for taxes and $388,586 to the owner as a profit distribution. </I>They also increased their cash by $237,569 to meet their two-month core capital target. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>ROIC stayed high, at 123%, and the company is fully capitalized. </I>Where can you get that kind of yield in the market?</LI></UL>
<DIV class=box>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Is Marketing to Blame?</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>For as much as every entrepreneur wants an algorithm to tell them how much to spend on marketing, our experience across many industries shows that it is more art than science. The most effective method is to test, evaluate, and expand until the market resists.</P>
<P class=noindent>If your results are not as expected, marketing may not be the issue; it could be that your product, service, or customer service approach is not what the market wants.</P></DIV>
<P class=noindent>The ATSi case study exemplifies the kinds of transformations that we often get to experience with our clients. I am amazed at how often entrepreneurs make effective decisions when they have timely and understandable business data.</P>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-84 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Key Data Points for Labor Productivity</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>There are only a handful of major data points you need to focus on when your data is structured so you can read it clearly. Here are a few more key takeaways from working with our clients on their labor productivity.</P>
<P class=scl><B class=calibre5>LER Is Your Four-Minute Mile Barrier</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Back in the 1950s it was widely believed that no human could ever run a mile faster than four minutes. Then Roger Bannister did it in 1954 with the help of two runners who helped pace him. LER in business is like a world record; it exists to be beaten, and it serves as a pacing mechanism. When our clients monitor LER by quarter, month, week, or day, they have a greater chance to achieve their desired target. Once they reach a new level, it reminds them what is possible and points to the next mile marker.</P>
<P class=scl><B class=calibre5>Focus on Labor Dollars, Not Bodies</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Whenever I hear an entrepreneur discuss revenue, profit, or any other measure per person, it makes me cringe. The last time I checked, no two people are the same, so a per-person metric to quantify output seems dehumanizing. I know it is not meant that way; it is just that people do not see the actual dollars they need to create a better measurement since most companies bury payroll information in their financial reports.</P>
<P class=scl><B class=calibre5>Equitability, Not Equality</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>This might not be a popular thing to say, but assuming the playing field is level in the first place, pay equitability is more important than equal pay. With an equal pay concept, the business or the employee is avoiding measurement to compare the levels of output by person. Equitability means paying more to those who consistently produce more. The nice thing about equitable pay is that it motivates the business owner to keep paying people more as they produce more, and the company often provides on-the-<A id=calibre_link-85 class=calibre4></A>job training to help employees achieve their best. It is the ultimate win/win scenario for employers and employees. In a highly competitive wage market, savvy businesses use this approach, rather than paying employees as little as they can, to keep the competition from stealing them away.</P>
<P class=noindent>One of my favorite behavioral economics researchers and authors is Adam Grant, who is a Wharton School professor and the bestselling author of <I class=calibre8>Give and Take</I>. He discussed the topic on his blog in a post about athlete pay on professional sports teams. He wrote, &#8220;Teams with unequal pay won fewer games when pay differences were not connected to performance. But they won more games when differences in pay were based on players&#8217; contributions. Equity matters more than equality. Differences in pay aren&#8217;t a problem, as long as they&#8217;re fair. When players are paid less than teammates who aren&#8217;t performing any better, jealousy, resentful [<I class=calibre8>sic</I>], and discouragement often follow. When they&#8217;re paid less than teammates who deliver more value, they understand&#8221; (&#8220;Should Teammates Get Equal Pay?&#8221; July 18, 2014, retrieved from <A class=calibre4 href="http://www.ethicalsystems.org/aggregator/sources/6">https://www.ethicalsystems.org/aggregator/sources/6?page=2).</A></P></DIV></DIV>

<P class=noindent1>In the ATSi case study earlier in this chapter, the company did not track hours by billable event. They are what I call a productized service business that charges a fixed price for each service. ATSi tracks teams of people who are responsible for each group of services, and that allowed them to identify some services that needed price increases and others that needed to be discontinued. It also allowed them to manage growth by team because, in terms of growth, certain services outpaced others. In a perfect world, we could track growth by person, but the team approach is valid.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=calibre_link-368 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Team Member Education</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>In the case study, ATSi invested heavily in educating their team members about gross margin, dLER, and contribution margin. <A id=calibre_link-203 class=calibre4></A>Although the company did not disclose everything, they shared the company&#8217;s goals and progress toward contribution margin targets as each year progressed. They established recognition of achievement bonuses that were paid when key targets were met, but they were not large amounts&#8212;just enough to reinforce the importance of hitting a target. The key point is that the CEO assumed responsibility for leading the training to prove the company was committed to the concept and was willing to explain and defend the strategy.</P>
<P class=scl><B class=calibre5>A-Player Grid</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>One of the favorite tools among my fellow Entrepreneurs&#8217; Organization members for team identification and development is the A-player grid. This tool has been around for a long time, and I am not sure of its origin, but figure 8.1 is an example of how I use it with my clients.</P>

<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>A-player grid.</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-88 class=calibre4></A>The first time that I saw an A-player grid, it was a typical four-quadrant consultant box. Most of my Entrepreneurs&#8217; Organization peers agree that culture, on the y-axis, is important enough to require that employees reach a level of 7 or higher. I always challenge my audiences to plot each of their team members on this graph. Very few people accept the challenge because they do not want to turn over that many people at once. Employees who fall in the bottom-left corner are easy for most of us to terminate quickly; those team members are low on culture and low on productivity. The employees in the upper-left quadrant are the lovable slackers. You like them, but they never get enough done to meet their productivity goals and are often found holding up the walls in the hall while talking to passersby. People in the bottom-right quadrant are the toughest to deal with; we call them the terrorists. They produce a lot but destroy your culture, and if you let them go it will cause a short-term loss. You wonder if they are truly committed to your culture or your profit.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=calibre_link-370 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Accounting for Contractors</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>While I always encourage our clients to correctly classify workers as employees or contractors, some industries encounter situations that are not always clear. For LER purposes, we include a contractor in COGS if they are a legitimate business and the amount you pay allows them to make a profit as a business, not just get paid a wage. Even though you might upcharge your customer for what the contractor charges you, it is reflected in your gross margin; essentially, you compensate your direct labor for interfacing with the contractor.</P>
<P class=noindent>When you hire a contracted freelancer who essentially charges a market labor rate plus payroll taxes (25% to 35% markup), it is fine to classify the freelancer as direct labor. The key is to be consistent. Many of our clients have perfected a way to keep their committed labor at peak LER and use subcontract labor to the same or better contribution margin for overflow work. If you <A id=calibre_link-83 class=calibre4></A>want to compare your contractor&#8217;s output to your team&#8217;s output, use contribution margin percentage.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-274 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-371 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Staffing Company Exception</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Over the years we have worked with several staffing company clients from various focused industries. Staffing companies work off very thin margins, compared to other service businesses, since they are essentially being paid to recruit employees, run their payroll, and replace them if the client does not like them. They do not manage the person. For this effort, they usually get a margin of 20% to 30%. Since that margin is so tight, we include payroll taxes in the margin calculation.</P>
<P class=noindent>These clients choose one of two approaches to view their data, which demonstrates the flexibility of our structure:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>For straight staffing agencies that just provide personnel, they include wages and payroll tax in COGS. Their recruiters and account managers are considered direct labor. 
<LI class=calibre11>If an agency has travel or other out-of-pocket costs, they are considered pass-through costs and are reflected in COGS. The contracted employee and associated payroll tax goes into direct labor, and the recruiter and account manager go into management labor. If the agency does have pass-through costs and wants to account for them like companies who do not have these costs, they are flowed through the balance sheet as reimbursable costs since they effectively inflate the revenue.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Either methodology works, as long as you consistently apply the approach you choose.</P>
<P class=scl><A id=calibre_link-82 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Matching Labor to Demand</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>There are two key plays you can use to match your labor level to your sales demand: sell to the labor level that you commit to, or flex your labor level as your sales demand changes.</P>
<P class=noindent>A lot of clients tell us they flex their labor to demand, when in reality, their rolling 12 labor graph shows labor going up and gross margin going down. Not every industry is suited to flex labor without major pain. Some companies have tried remote workers with flexible schedules, or they look for part-time employees to match labor to demand.</P>
<P class=noindent>As an example, Starbucks considers a team member to be full time at 30 hours per week. A team member can be asked to work up to 40 hours, but they are guaranteed 30 hours in six shifts of 5 hours each. That gives Starbucks a labor flexibility of 25% with no overtime premium. They make sure to hire people who can live on 30 hours per week so managers are not pressured to schedule employees for extra hours, even if the company does not need that much labor. A key point here is that team members are scheduled in 5-hour shifts.</P>
<P class=noindent>In terms of performance, the ideal shift length for part-time workers is five hours because that is the maximum allowed before a meal break. Among our clients, we have seen that any time an employee takes a full meal break, there is a loss of productivity as the meal break approaches and a slow ramp-up after the break ends. I have yet to find a business that could mitigate this loss.</P>
<P class=noindent>Similarly, for a full-time day worker, optimum productivity occurs in a 10-hour shift. This is the longest work day that does not cross over two meal periods. Several of our manufacturing clients have found that four 10-hour days gives them greater output than five 8-hour days. Their challenge is the same as faced <A id=calibre_link-93 class=calibre4></A>by Starbucks: finding people who want to work on that schedule and possibly keeping an overlapping team in place. A few years ago I read that USAA, an insurance company, split their team in half and went to four-day, 10-hour shifts. Half of the team worked Monday through Thursday, and the other half worked Tuesday through Friday. I do not know if that innovative model is still in place. The only concern would be customer service coverage on Monday and Friday.</P>
<P class=noindent>Certain roles may not allow for 5- or 10-hour shifts, but many production environments are well-suited for this model. The downside is that this structure introduces cultural difficulties that you have to manage. Any time an employee is working when others are not, they think they are doing all the work.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-277 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-372 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Moneyball for Business</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>It is flattering when our clients refer to my LER concepts as Moneyball for business. Clearly there is more to Billy Beane&#8217;s statistical analysis that pulled the Oakland A&#8217;s out of the cellar and later helped the Red Sox win their first World Series in 86 years to finally overcome the curse of the Bambino! When you can get LER down to the team member who produced it, you start to have the ability to build your championship roster, just like a sports team does. You will see the productivity arc of your team as they progress, and you can start to identify who is in it for a championship run and who is in it for a season.</P>
<P class=noindent>Like all time and billing systems, the software our firm uses, Practice CS by Thomson Reuters, allows us to establish a standard billable rate by person. But Practice CS allows us to connect those billable hours to a client invoice, and it will write up or down everybody&#8217;s billable dollars to what made it to the invoice. Most simplistic time tracking systems will not do this critical step, so they do not allow you to determine actual billed value by employee. If you do not connect the ultimate value that <A id=calibre_link-197 class=calibre4></A>made it to the invoice by employee, it would be like measuring quarterbacks against pass attempts, regardless of how many were completed and for how many yards.</P>
<P class=noindent>If your time keeping system can handle this allocation process, you have a huge advantage because you can measure true output. The process is not without subjectivity, however, because you can allocate write-offs against everyone who worked on a task, even though some individuals may not have caused the loss. We win together and fail together, and even though a system may allow for specific write-offs by person, every person should support team efficiency rather than being the one who shines and saves the day. From the data I get for our firm, it is obvious who the top performers are, even though they may share some writeoffs they are not responsible for.</P>
<P class=noindent>Tracking LER by person also helps when you mix contractors in with your employees. Our clients are often shocked when they see their lack of leverage when they use contractors, compared to keeping full-time employees busy. It is not uncommon for an employee who you utilize 50% of the time to give you a higher margin than a contractor. It pays to do the math.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=calibre_link-373 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Career Labor Efficiency Curve</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>One of my most requested slides after a presentation is the career labor efficiency curve. The graph looks at an employee and compares their labor output and compensation for each year across their career. Before we dig in, let&#8217;s look at baseball to introduce the concept.</P>
<P class=noindent>Baseball uses an output metric that I wish we had in business; it is called wins above replacement (WAR). Here is what Wikipedia says about WAR: &#8220;A player&#8217;s WAR value is claimed to be the number of additional wins his team has achieved above the <A id=calibre_link-215 class=calibre4></A>number of expected team wins if that player were substituted with a replacement-level player: a player who may be added to the team for minimal cost and effort.&#8221; I am not endorsing the accuracy of the metric; but assuming it is a reasonable representation of output, Jason Varitek, retired catcher of the Boston Red Sox, is one of the best examples I could find (figure 8.2).</P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt=""></P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-295 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-374 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Figure 8.2</B></H2>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>WAR and compensation for Jason Varitek.</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=noindent>The Boston Red Sox have long been my favorite team, even though I live in Alabama. As the Red Sox made their 2004 run to break through and finally win their first World Series in 86 years, Varitek was a key player and team leader. His WAR rose each year from 2001 to 2005, and you can see that he was getting steady pay increases. As a catcher, he had a tough job. Players at that position usually have shorter careers, and they rarely get long-term deals due to the high risk of injury.</P>
<P class=noindent>After winning the World Series in 2004, many of the key players, including Varitek, got raises and multi-year deals, since other teams were looking to draw them away in free agency. Varitek&#8217;s on-field performance declined due to some injuries, but the front office knew that his leadership on the team offset his declining batting average. Eventually, Varitek decided to refocus his efforts, <A id=calibre_link-156 class=calibre4></A>so he retired and became part of the Red Sox front office with reduced pay.</P>
<P class=noindent>Even though you probably do not have a World Series trophy, it is no different in your business. A key employee helps you achieve a significant level of attainment in your business, so you give them a big raise or bonuses, but the employee does not continue with the same output level. Look for an opportunity to change the person&#8217;s role and compensation, like the Red Sox did with Varitek, and keep a key leader around at the right amount of pay. Sometimes the employee will leave after entertaining offers from other companies. Or maybe they will find their second wind and their career takes off again. In other cases they discover that their skills have become outdated in a changing marketplace, and they have to either retool their skills or accept a different role.</P>

<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Career labor efficiency curve: Three zones.s</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-110 class=calibre4></A>To reflect these changing dynamics, I break down the career labor efficiency curve into three segments: the training zone, the chasing zone, and the replacement zone (figure 8.3).</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-291 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-376 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Training Zone</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>When someone starts working for you, they rarely produce enough in the beginning to justify their pay. It could take days, weeks, months, or years for their productivity to exceed their pay, and this period is called the training zone. It is important to make the training zone as compressed as possible, but it also needs to be effective. Make sure the person knows they cannot stop improving when they produce more than they make, which I call the crossover point. This is just the beginning of the chase!</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-293 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-377 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Chasing Zone</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>When the employee hits the crossover point, they enter the chasing zone. This zone embraces the idea that, in the best compensation models, pay chases performance (not the other way around). The most tried-and-true way to maintain profitability is to have the employee prove they can produce before you increase their pay. However, if you are at risk for losing a key team member, you might have to pay before they perform. In that case, establish a new output expectation to justify the raise. If the employee resists the new expectation, you might need to let the other company draft them, and you can bring up the next player from the bench.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-294 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-378 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Replacement Zone</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>The toughest part of personnel management occurs in the replacement zone. The harsh reality is that we all reach a point when, after a long run of successful productivity, our pay exceeds our output. Larger companies can experiment with options like changing roles and adjusting pay. Smaller companies must act faster because they have only a few key producers. This is why <A id=calibre_link-157 class=calibre4></A>we encourage companies to invest in systems and processes that measure team members&#8217; output so you can help extend their career as their performance starts to wane. Also, you must be careful to not attribute lower margins to labor if you are not raising prices to keep up with inflation in your labor costs. When you face the data objectively, you have a much better chance of keeping your team productive longer and reducing drama when replacements are needed. My bet is there will always be something for capable people to do if you are willing to adapt.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>LER as a Tool for the Future</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>When I first created the principles and methodology of LER, I had no idea how big it would become. My team has witnessed its impact and the clarity it gives our clients, who now have a metric to match up to what they see in the business and what they cannot see when they are away from the business.</P>
<P class=noindent>I predict that LER will continue to gain popularity as technology starts to enhance team members&#8217; roles in a labor-constricted economy. Who knows where it will go from there?

<P class=center>&#8211; Greg Crabtree</P>
<P class=noindent1a>Now that you have seen your business model margins and LER for your business in total, it is time go 3D to see how each segment of your business performs. Most businesses will have more than one distinct product, service, division, or location in their business model. Traditional financial presentations leave a lot to be desired in understanding how each of these segments is performing. This lack of delineation in your data opens the door to an endless stream of excuses in management meetings on why the business missed its mark this month. With more precision in your reporting, you can put your finger on exactly what&#8217;s going right&#8212;and what needs to be cut.</P>
<P class=sca><I class=calibre14>You must face the harsh reality that corporate<BR class=calibre9>costs need to be held accountable to the net<BR class=calibre9>operating income generated by the segments!</I></P>
<P class=noindent>The first big mistake accountants make in segment reporting is to try to produce a full P&amp;L for each segment by allocating out <A id=calibre_link-130 class=calibre4></A>corporate or shared costs. As a young bank controller, I learned this lesson when I prepared the first ever branch profitability report for my bank. I was quite proud of it, until I showed it to the branch managers and they all protested, &#8220;Why did you allocate that to me? I don&#8217;t have anything to do with those costs!&#8221;</P>
<P class=noindent>After I thought about it, I realized that they were exactly correct. Why should their branch&#8217;s P&amp;L show anything that was not directly related to it? I modified the report to show only the actual operating expenses of each individual branch. It was corporate&#8217;s responsibility to manage the costs that were not directly associated with the branches. I also gave the branches cost-of-money credit for the deposits they generated that other branches loaned out. For the branches that loaned out more than they had in deposits, I charged them for the cost of money they used from the other branches. The managers agreed this was a more useful presentation, as it gave us a pattern of the most successful branches to try to replicate.</P>
<P class=noindent>Ultimately, I learned that it is a useless exercise to allocate out corporate costs. I learned to hold corporate costs accountable to net operating income from the segments, because that income from all branches had to be high enough to cover the corporate overhead costs and make the target profit. Holding corporate costs accountable makes management uncomfortable sometimes, but facing that harsh reality is needed to build a great business.</P>
<P class=noindent>Since many businesses do not have a clean segment like a branch or location, I have developed principles for every business to define their segment reporting and take it as deep as is practical for analysis purposes.</P></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-379 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Segment Reporting Concepts</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Segment profitability is pretty simple when you have locations or very distinct operating divisions. However, segment analysis <A id=calibre_link-57 class=calibre4></A>can go much deeper than that. The key is to not get sucked into allocation hell trying to get to a corporate net income by segment. There are three levels you can dive down to in segment reporting: Gross Margin (Level 1), Contribution Margin (Level 2), and Net Operating Income for Segment (Level 3). When we first start working with a new client, many will only have Gross Margin data. As they see the benefits of tracking direct labor, we can get them to Level 2, Contribution Margin. Typically, most segments stop here unless you have a formal division or location structure. Any of the three levels can be useful, but the deeper you can go with accurate tracking of costs, the more insight you will have.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H3 class=sigilnotintoc>Segment reporting levels</H3>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt=""></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-58 class=calibre4></A>As we have discussed, your operating expense structure is not that flexible, and I prefer to get any segment first to a gross margin number and then to a contribution margin number. If there are any operating expenses that would go away if that segment went away, it would be acceptable to identify those as &#8220;turn-off costs&#8221; and then get to a net operating income of segment&#8212;which would be defined as the amount of profit or loss that would disappear if that segment did not exist. It would not get allocations of overhead or other general supporting operating expenses that you would assume would remain. Your guiding principle of segment reporting is: if the revenue or expense turns on while we have this segment and turns off when it goes away, then treat that revenue or expense as a segment item.</P>
<P class=noindent>A segment can be anything that we can first get to gross margin. Then hopefully, we can connect direct labor to that gross margin and get down to a contribution margin. A common list of segments might include:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>By line of business 
<LI class=calibre11>By customer 
<LI class=calibre11>By division 
<LI class=calibre11>By location 
<LI class=calibre11>By team 
<LI class=calibre11>By job or contract 
<LI class=calibre11>By employee 
<LI class=calibre11>Any other activity that can be tracked by revenue, COGS, and direct labor</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-59 class=calibre4></A>Segments that should have similar margin and LER would be jobs, contracts, and customers. For these, your best performers will be obvious and you should work to bring the rest up to that level. Lines of business can have a dramatic difference in performance. Make sure to stay focused on margin, not revenue. For lines of business that have different margin percentages, you can use a return-on-investment rate to determine which line is best by taking segment profit divided by all of the trade capital and infrastructure capital required for that activity to get a return on investment for that segment.</P>

<H2 id=calibre_link-381 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Location Segments</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Let&#8217;s start with a simple example of a multi-location retail business. In table 9.2, we have a complete P&amp;L for store-specific income and expenses. To best compare the stores, the leading numbers of the group for each major criterion is highlighted in green. The far right column represents what a theoretical store could do if it optimized each of the best characteristics.</P></DIV></DIV>

<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00032.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-60 class=calibre4></A>Take note that the store with the most revenue does not have all of the best characteristics. Store 2 produced the largest dollar amount of store profit, but it was not as efficient as Store 1. Store 1 sold at a higher gross margin and had lower operating costs. In retail, it is difficult to match operating expenses by store, but margin output has to compensate for a store that costs more to operate. Store 3 seems to do the best with managing labor, so you would look at what they are doing differently from the other stores.</P>
<P class=noindent>Based on the P&amp;L, Store 2 would still be the rooster crowing about how good they are, since profit dollars are all that matter. Right? But P&amp;L&#8217;s do not tell the whole story&#8212;so let&#8217;s add the return-on-investment analysis to the bottom for table 9.3 and look at inventory by location and buildout costs by location.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-25 class=calibre>

<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00030.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-131 class=calibre4></A>Now we see the true story! Store 4 is the one that makes us the best return on our investment. Store 4 sells less because they have taken a focused inventory approach to only stock the inventory that has good margin. It turns five times a year instead of the shotgun inventory approach Store 2 is using to stock more and see what sells. Which store do you think is more likely to wake up one day and realize they need to write-down inventory that will never sell? Store 2 is at a higher risk of developing stale inventory that you will eventually have to dump.</P>
<P class=noindent>Store 4 also accomplished a lower buildout cost by having the landlord handle some renovation as part of their rent. The company also looked for retail space that was more ready to fit. Lower inventory and buildout all count to ROIC, and efficient use of capital allows for more stores to be opened. I would also think there are many more potential locations that would support $850K in revenue than $1.3M. This is a great example of why you cannot rely on the P&amp;L alone in your analysis of best segment activity.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=calibre_link-384 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Division Segments</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>To explain division segments, we will use an example company that performs installation and maintenance of equipment and requires field services labor. This example, showin in table 9.4, segregates activity into projects, recurring maintenance contracts, and new construction projects. Even though they are using the same skill set for each area, the business models are quite different.</P>
<P class=noindent>The project work produces the most revenue, but you can see the recurring maintenance work yields the best rate of contribution margin. Before this company broke out the activity, they thought their margins were the same for all activities. They were also surprised at how low the margin was on the new construction segment.</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-61 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 9.4</B></P>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Initial division segment summary</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00022.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent>To improve performance, they looked at LER by project and determined which projects were below acceptable LER. They determined it was a blend of poor pricing habits and poor execution. After addressing those issues, they were able to bring up contribution margin percentage for projects by 6%, which flowed to the bottom line. Not much improvement was needed on the recurring segment, just to continue growing it and not let margin and LER decline in ways that were preventable. They realized that construction was not a good segment for them if they wanted to aggressively grow, so they assigned a small amount of staff resources to choose only those construction projects that would lead to recurring work or other project work.</P>
<P class=noindent>To look deeper, let&#8217;s now add an analysis of their segment investment to the view in table 9.5. In this scenario, I have shown only trade capital as the investment, since their infrastructure capital would be assumed to be used evenly across all activities and mostly consists of service vehicles.</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-62 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 9.5</B></P>

<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00011.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent>This is where you really see why private equity values companies with recurring revenue. Since there is a service agreement, you are always billing in advance, with only a few slow-paying customers. This is why the recurring AR days outstanding is only 5 days, where it is 45 days for projects and 75 days for construction. There are tactics you can employ to try to lower the days in the other activities, but you are not likely to get either to equal the speed of payment from the recurring work.</P>
<P class=noindent>Since I am basing the return calculation on a margin number, I chose to express it a multiplier rather than a percentage, but either way will work. It is clear that their project work is far better than their construction work. You can also see the significant improvement in the return on the projects, once they improved the LER from 2.22 to 2.84. That slight increase in labor productivity more than doubled the return on trade capital, from 3.57 to 7.89.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-191 class=calibre4></A>Now that they have optimized each activity, they can be more effective at scaling if the market is there. If scaling requires tradeoff decisions of price or terms, they have the tools to evaluate the impact of both.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=calibre_link-385 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Service Team Segments</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>More than any other business model, service business models benefit from LER tracking by person or team. What you bill the customer is the pure output of the labor cost to provide that service. This is why timekeeping is so important, so you can evaluate the &#8220;cost&#8221; to provide the service. Most people make the error of thinking that you track time in order to bill for your time. Unfortunately, billing by the hour ultimately causes you to either give away your expertise or charge for your ignorance. The goal is to maximize the value of your labor whenever the market allows, by using fixed-price billing methods and then managing the labor to the least cost to deliver the service.</P>
<P class=noindent>The case study below is adapted from a service company that used similar labor for all three service teams, but used different approaches to sell and manage the work. We have found the concepts in the case study to apply to any service industry (legal, accounting, marketing, IT, engineering or industrial). However, LER by industry can vary dramatically, so do not use these rates as benchmarks. You must study your own industry and company to develop your own targets.</P>
<P class=noindent>Let&#8217;s meet the teams. Each exemplifies a distinct billing model.</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Hourly Billed Project Services (&#8220;Project&#8221;). </I>This is the most common business model in the services world. Many companies have survived a long time using this approach. Yet, in a tight labor market, it is starting to show why it has deficiencies. Common characteristics are: 
<UL class=calibre16>
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-138 class=calibre4></A>Services are billed by the hour or by soft estimate to customer. Rarely will a job not have a write-down of time, and there is no opportunity for a write-up. 
<LI class=calibre11>Bill rates can either be a common rate for anybody who works it or vary by skill level. My team and I are not fans of the single rate approach, since you theoretically can never work up rate, you can only work down rate. 
<LI class=calibre11>Projects are loosely scheduled as to deadlines, but workers do not calendar out tasks. Essentially, the whole team is working from a &#8220;to do&#8221; list. 
<LI class=calibre11>There may be a master schedule of expected project completion but little to no project status vision. If they keep time, you may have total time spent, but snot likely by task or estimate of time to complete. If you don&#8217;t track time, you are totally blind. 
<LI class=calibre11>The process depends on a team of self-managed staff. This is nice to have and is more common in a soft labor market when more people are available to build your team. In a tight labor market, it is hard to find that skill set, and it takes time, dollars, and turnover to build those team members.</LI></UL>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Hourly Billed Scheduled Services (&#8220;Scheduled&#8221;). </I>This is a common model in the home services industries, but we see it starting to be applied in other service areas with success. Common characteristics are: 
<UL class=calibre16>
<LI class=calibre11>Billing is generally still done by the hour or by rate sheet value for a task, but is not as prone to writedown for hourly billing. I recommend billing every two weeks and no less frequently than monthly. 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-136 class=calibre4></A>All services are managed through a calendar system to put the task on the calendar of the team members. This allows for vision of capacity and gives each team member a definite production target. The calendar has to allow for project shift and overruns, as well as leaving room for high value tasks that randomly come up. 
<LI class=calibre11>The calendar system requires a coordinator to oversee the team calendar and pull forward or push out tasks as demand changes. It becomes pretty obvious very quickly who can work to a schedule and who either constantly works late to catch up or is just always missing schedules. 
<LI class=calibre11>The minimum schedule would be always two weeks out, but longer is better if you have recurring tasks. This is very similar to the two-week-sprint cycle in Agile programming concepts.</LI></UL>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Fixed-Price Productized Services (&#8220;Fixed Price&#8221;)</I>. Niche segments of every industry have the service providers that found a way to bill on a fixed-price basis and control the scope of the engagement. The challenge has been to bring that approach to the broader market. This approach is more common with a non-commodity service, but we are seeing it applied with success anytime the customer prefers a fixed price and you can manage scope and create clear points of when change orders apply. Common characteristics are: 
<UL class=calibre16>
<LI class=calibre11>You have created a process that gives you an advantage over your competition to some or all of your service with less cost than the market. Billing <A id=calibre_link-137 class=calibre4></A>for the value of the service and not your time allows you to gain the margin you deserve. 
<LI class=calibre11>Customers prefer a fixed price for this service instead of hourly. Fixed price is like buying an extended warranty; sometimes it makes sense, and sometimes it does not. Fixed price that is presented as a good value proposition builds pricing trust quicker than an hourly method. Most entrepreneurs tell me they hate being billed by the hour if they do not have an idea of how much time it would take. 
<LI class=calibre11>Project quoting is faster, since you can establish common pricing for repeatable services. Customers love the ability to get a quote quickly. 
<LI class=calibre11>Your staff has a clear idea of what to perform to, and any gains accrue to them as higher performance. 
<LI class=calibre11>You still need to track time for cost accounting purposes. Our preferred accountability is to assign a market billing rate per person, relative to their value to the market and their salary. You multiply each person&#8217;s market rate by their hours to get what you would have charged by the hour for the project. Then you write up or down the project and allocate the billing adjustment to each person. Sophisticated billing systems will do this for you, and we have devised offline methods to create that data when the system is lacking capability.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>So let&#8217;s look at the numbers for our three teams; see table 9.6.</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-132 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 9.6</B></P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-140 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-386 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Initial service segment summary</B></H2>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00027.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent>You can see in table 9.6 that the billed hours before write-offs show that the Project team is putting in the hours! Most businesses would consider them the key driver of their business. But in the world I live in, it is your output and your effectiveness that matter (see table 9.7).</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-133 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 9.7</B></P>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Service segment summary with write-offs</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00014.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent>After we look at write-offs in table 9.7, you can see that the project revenue dropped in significance to the total. In our experience in dealing with service businesses, this is about as far as they take their analysis, other than net revenues by customer. Let&#8217;s take the analysis to the next level! See table 9.8.</P>
<P class=text1a>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8>Service segment summary with LE</I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00017.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent>Since we can attach the labor by team to the net revenues, we now know the margin by team that tells true story in table 9.8. Margin in this example would also be the same as contribution margin, since there is no cost of goods sold in this example, just labor.</P>
<P class=noindent>In year 3, the fixed price team produces the most margin. They have fewer write-offs than the projects team, and their labor consistently produces at a higher LER. This is an excellent example of how taking these extra steps to analyze performance can prevent you from making the mistake of pushing the least profitable service just because it is the biggest top line.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-192 class=calibre4></A>A robust system would also allow you to know this information by customer, and even by employee. You have to interpret that information in context, but it is invaluable to have. If you know LER by customer, you can establish a minimum expected target, and any relationship that falls below the minimum is reviewed. You should always review first if it is your performance or oneoff issues that were unforeseen. Otherwise, you would choose to re-price or re-scope for future work, or disengage from the customer. You would also review the &#8220;unforeseen&#8221; issues and improve your ability to spot those on future projects.</P>
<P class=noindent>A couple of insights from this data:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Project LER is declining, indicating either pricing issues or project management issues. </I>In this data set, pricing was to market so the decline was due purely to work management and training. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Scheduled LER is stable, yet customer LER for them indicated that a higher LER is attainable with the right mix of staff skill levels. </I>The main issue pulling down their LER is senior staff backfilling on lower-rate projects. While their team spirit is admirable, you can quantify the lost margin by not having the right staff at each service level. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Fixed price LER is stable, but customer LER data shows an opportunity to push it up with full utilization of the team.</I></LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Since we now have this framework, it is easy to do capacity forecasting by team, should you get to the correct LER, as shown in table 9.9.</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-134 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 9.9</B></P>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8>Service segment summary with forecasting</I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt=""></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-135 class=calibre4></A>By identifying the potential LER for each team, you can back into targeted performance.</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Projects have the greatest potential capacity to improve.</I> It is possible that by adopting the calendar approach to scheduling, they would be able to match the scheduled team in productivity and exceed it in some cases for noncommodity projects. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>The other two teams need minor improvements, but this supports our idea that it is better to get margin and LER right before you try to aggressively grow.</I> 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Notice that the fixed-price team gets 10% higher margin even after optimization. </I>While this may not always be the case, this is a good target to aim for and beat when you can. It still requires managing the team resources, but we see this technique fitting in with team behavior better than leaving it up to each person to schedule their tasks. Everybody has the intention of working to their best, but the actions taken without some management nudging rarely happen.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Segment analysis is the power tool for all growing businesses, and this concept is just as relevant for a $1 million business as it is for a $1 billion business. This approach also allows you to share data with a segment leader and not get into costs or revenues they have no control over. While I am a fan of open book management, not every business has laid the groundwork to share data. Using segment data can be a baby step towards more data sharing with your team, and helping them understand the direction in which you want to lead them.

<P class=sc><I class=calibre8>A budget is a license to spend; a forecast is a<BR class=calibre9>license to make money by spending only on<BR class=calibre9>things that add value beyond their cost.</I></P>
<P class=center>&#8211; Greg Crabtree</P>
<P class=noindent1a>Let&#8217;s take a poll: Who wants to live or work under a budget? Even if you raised your hand, I bet you are using the wrong word to describe what you mean. Assuming everyone agrees that we want the best possible financial outcome and no one is telling a story to justify their actions, the best approach is what I call value-based spending. You spend a dollar to recover the dollar you spent plus some multiplier above that.</P>
<P class=noindent>My heartburn about budgeting comes from years of experience seeing budgets gone bad. Budgeting is a license to spend, whereas plans and forecasts are licenses to make money. Forecasts that assume all things will work perfectly usually fail. Like our team says, we always make money on the spreadsheet. You must learn to be an accurate forecaster, like Jack Stack and the Great Game of Business people stress, or your only option is to live under a cost-constraint budget.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-214 class=calibre4></A>Since most budgets are developed on a year-to-year basis, a budget mentality is not flexible enough for midyear corrections. If you are significantly off budget in the first quarter, you will naturally disconnect from the budget and sacrifice performance for the rest of the year, until the next budgeting cycle. You could be on target with your spending for operating expenses but off budget for revenue and margin. If you stick to your budget, you will spend your way down the bankruptcy path until it is too late to correct your course.</P>
<P class=noindent>We see this play out every day in government and large corporate settings. Those organizations do not trust their management to make course corrections, and the red tape to change direction is discouraging. Spending continues as planned, regardless of receipts taken in.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Base Your Spending on Value Received</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>To base spending on value received sounds great in theory, but as a practical matter it does require some process parameters to be in place, as my experience suggests.</P>
<P class=noindent>As a 26-year-old CPA, I had just been hired away from my first job to be the controller, and eventually the VP of operations, of a $140 million local bank. Even though I had audited banks, I did not have management experience. I was good with numbers, so I used that strength to question the status quo and make suggestions for improvement. I also found that it was far more effective to bring my ideas up with the CEO directly than to introduce them in a committee.</P>
<P class=noindent>The CEO was an experienced banker, and we connected quickly. He was very busy, so I had to choose strategic times to present my new ideas. I observed that he often came in to the bank on Sunday afternoons to clear his mail, and he would walk through <A id=calibre_link-107 class=calibre4></A>the bank from the fifth floor to the first just to see if anyone was around. When he came through the third floor where my office was, I had my next idea ready for him. Most of the time it took five minutes or less for me to present my idea because I had learned what he wanted to know before he would approve an action that was not part of the original annual plan. This was also one of the best times for me to learn from him, since nobody was around; he trusted me to keep things confidential and would speak freely.</P>
<P class=noindent>Before long, my fellow VPs (who were twice my age and had three times as much experience) were grumbling that I got special treatment because all my initiatives were green-lighted, and they struggled to get their ideas approved. I defended myself by saying I did not get what <I class=calibre8>I </I>wanted&#8212;I got what <I class=calibre8>he </I>wanted. I learned to listen to him and had answers ready for the questions I had learned to anticipate.</P>
<P class=sca><I class=calibre14>The ability to look critically at a problem and<BR class=calibre9>consider the needs of all stakeholders is a<BR class=calibre9>foundational principle of value-based spending.</I></P>
<P class=noindent>The ability to look critically at a problem and consider the needs of all stakeholders is a foundational principle of value-based spending. You must take into account everyone who is impacted by an increase or a cut. Your ability to anticipate the impact and have answers before you present is key to building the trust of the team and business leaders.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Key Areas in a Spending Plan</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>To devise a spending plan, you can create revenue and cost buckets to help guide your analysis. Here are the key areas you need to address for each choice:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-63 class=calibre4></A><I class=calibre8>Revenue. </I>Does this spend help generate enough revenue, less cost of goods and labor, to cover the expenditure? The key mistake people make is to count revenue against the cost instead of against the net margin after cost of goods sold and labor. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Cost of goods or services. </I>Does this spend lower the cost of goods or services so the gross margin is higher than the proposed increase in spending? 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Direct labor. </I>Does this increased spend help make the direct labor more efficient, or does it reduce the direct labor by more than the amount spent? The breakout businesses we work with find a way to get more gross margin for every labor dollar spent. Sometimes this is accomplished by investing in technology, and sometimes by getting rid of ineffective technology and going old school! This is when your direct labor efficiency ratio helps you set a productivity target for the next direct labor employee. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Operating expenses. </I>Does this increased spend cause another cost to go down, or does a spending cut prevent another cost from rising to the same level or higher? 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Culture/brand. </I>Is this spend necessary to maintain the stated culture or brand? If we do not spend on this item, would it violate what we say about our company? This is the toughest answer to quantify, but your team has to reach an agreement and commit to it.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-176 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-387 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Evaluate Normal Ongoing Operations</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>For recurring or normal operations, the best approach is to question each cost decision as it is presented and ask this value question: are we still getting value from this item? If not, either <A id=calibre_link-209 class=calibre4></A>stop it and see if anyone misses it, or bring it up for review by the next-higher management level and anticipate what answers will be needed, as in my banking story earlier in this chapter. The best review of normal operating expenses can be done by looking at rolling 12 trends for these groups of large expenses:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Facilities 
<LI class=calibre11>Marketing 
<LI class=calibre11>Other operating expenses (catchall bucket)</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>When you see a rolling 12 trend that looks odd, drill down into the line item costs.</P>
<P class=noindent>Here are a few tricks of the trade that work well:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Credit card charges. </I>Make sure to record credit card charges in detail. It is best to download them into your accounting system so you have the vendor name for each charge. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Vendor summary. </I>Run a quarterly report of your total spend by vendor, and rank them from largest to smallest. It is amazing how many times this causes overspending to pop out. A traditional profit and loss statement will not highlight this problem. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Recurring credit card and Automated Clearing House (ACH) charges. </I>Watch for recurring bills, credit card charges, and ACH charges for things that are no longer being used. This is the reason your gym wants you to pay monthly and forget about coming! Credit card companies have reports that list recurring charges and anticipated upcoming charges. If you do not have your account set to send you those reports, go to the company&#8217;s website and turn them on. Also turn on email notifications for merchant credits so you can be sure they actually credit you after you cancel an order. 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-199 class=calibre4></A><I class=calibre8>Chart of accounts. </I>Less is more, so do not create insignificant accounts. When you overdo it, your reports will be too noisy and you will not notice all those fine details. As a general rule, you do not need a general ledger account for an item that costs $1,000 or less in a year&#8212;I could even live with a $5,000 threshold. Current accounting software can drill down to the details and generate other reports, so a long chart of accounts is no longer necessary.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>As a rule of thumb for most business models, if I add a dollar of operating expense to increase productivity (other than labor), I generally want it to create $2 of revenue. Marketing expenses depend on each business. Separate expenditures for branding and general awareness marketing from expenditures for transactional marketing, such as search engine optimization, AdWords, and so forth.</P>
<P class=noindent>Thinking about value-based spending will help you avoid the pitfalls of a budgeting mindset. It can lead to a more adaptive approach to help you trim costs in a tight market and scale up when the market is hot.
