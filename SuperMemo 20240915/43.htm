Basically, the amount that something <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=46 id=page_46></SPAN>depreciates in a given year is a cost that is allocated against income for that year. This makes sense: The amount by which the asset depreciated can arguably be said to have been used in the company&#8217;s business activity of the year that generated the income.

A ten-year life span and an original cost of $1 million will mean that XYZ will depreciate the printing press at a rate of $100,000 a year. Depreciation is a real cost of doing business, because at some time in the future, the printing press will have to be replaced.

A neat trick that Wall Street financial types have figured out is that once the printing press is bought and paid for, the $100,000 yearly depreciation expense doesn&#8217;t take any more additional cash outlays, but it does decrease earnings that are reported to the IRS every year for the next ten years. This means that, from a short-term perspective, XYZ has a yearly cost that in reality isn&#8217;t costing it any additional outlays of cash. Thus, the Wall Street financial types can add that $100,000 cost back into earnings, which means that the cash flow of the business can now support more debt for such fun money-making ventures as leveraged buyouts. Wall Street has an acronym for this earnings recalculation: They call it EBITDA&#8212;meaning Earnings Before Income Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization.
