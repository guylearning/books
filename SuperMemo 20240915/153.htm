The amount of working capital available to a company is determined by the long-term funds that are not tied up in long-term assets. When a business is being set up, long-term funds are injected from the owners and other long sources. A considerable amount of these will be spent to acquire fixed long-term assets. However a sufficient amount must remain to take care of short-term day-to-day working capital requirements. Normally as time goes on this need grows with the development of the company. This need can be met only from additional long-term funds e.g., retained earnings, or long loans, or from the disposal of fixed assets.
