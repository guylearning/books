<P class=indent><A id=page_52>You start the year having $100,000 in cash. That&#8217;s not an insignificant sum, if we&#8217;re talking about a $1 million (or less) business. Then assume you had a pretax profit of $125,000. That&#8217;s a good profit number; it&#8217;s 12.5 percent. So how is it that you have only $25,000 of cash available at the end of the year after paying $50,000 in taxes ($125,000 x 0.40)?</A></P><A id=page_52>
<P class=indent>After thinking about it, you realize, Oh, yeah, I did buy a $50,000 SUV for the business. I bought it right at the end of the year to save some money on my taxes. A whole series of &#8220;Oh, yeah&#8221; moments follow as you realize you made a $50,000 down payment on a condo and you made $50,000 in principal payments on a line of credit. Then you understand that you went from $100,000 in cash to $25,000 because you either spent the money or repaid what you borrowed. Exhibit 4.1 contains the math.</P>

<P class=indent><A id=page_52>A better approach would have been to start with the $100,000 cash and add your pretax profit of $125,000 for the year (total cash available of $225,000). Then pay your taxes (force #1) of $50,000 and repay the <A id=page_53>loan (force #2) of $50,000. This leaves you $125,000 before you calculate your core capital target (force #3). This is usually referred to as <SPAN class=cmitalic>working capital</SPAN>, but after studying it I realized that a better name is <SPAN class=cmitalic>core capital target</SPAN>. Your core capital target is simply this: two months of operating expenses in cash and nothing drawn on a line of credit. In this example, your company&#8217;s core capital target is $100,000 (two months of operating expenses). That means you have $25,000 available for distributions (force #4). You know what this means, right? You shouldn&#8217;t have bought the $50,000 SUV or put $50,000 down on a condo. Exhibit 4.2 contains the corrected math.</A></P><A id=page_53>

<P class=indent>Looking at this calculation&#8212;and knowing what it means&#8212;helps give you the courage to make the right choices. Having the data allows you to quantify it and say you&#8217;re not going past a specified red line. If you do go past it, you know you&#8217;re making a really bad choice. In fact, you&#8217;ve stepped into dangerous territory.</P></A>
