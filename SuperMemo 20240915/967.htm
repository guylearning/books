You already know how I feel about that. I said, &#8220;You&#8217;re one bump away from being out of business. You have two choices. You have to cut $100,000 in salaries or you have to not spend a single dime until you produce $100,000 more in gross profit. I don&#8217;t care which one you pick, but you have to pick one of these two options.&#8221; A couple of days later, he called and wanted to talk.</A></P><A id=page_44>

<P class=blockquote>Greg: <SPAN class=cmitalic>Great! You found $75,000. Now you need to find $25,000 more.</SPAN></P></A>
