<H1 class=title><A id=ch15lev1sec1></A>Introduction</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>The material covered to date has concerned itself with the company as a single overall unit. In this chapter we probe down into the detailed operations. Of course we find at this level that there are a multitude of separate products within the overall company. Each of these is a small business in itself, and each has its own associated revenue and cost.</P>
<P>The internal operating dynamics of these sub-units can be quite complicated. We use a cost/management accounting system to give information and help to make decisions at this level. We would like to be in a position where we can establish a total cost for a product, add on a profit margin and then sell at the target selling price. Rarely are we able to do this. The price we would like to charge is generally 10 percent above that of our competitors. The manager is constantly being asked to get costs down or to sell at or below the total cost figure.</P>

<P>How is it possible to make profits in this scenario? There is no magic answer, but what we can do is to recognize that the main function of cost accounting is not to arrive at a selling price but to identify the areas where profit is possible. This means understanding how costs behave &#8211; in particular, how they respond to changes in the variables: price, volume and, above all, product mix.</P></DIV>
<P>It was mentioned earlier that the performance model which copes well with the big business scene is not good at this level of detail. However, it is at this level that profits are made and lost. Also, it is at this level that day-to-day decisions are made as to what price to quote for a job, whether to accept or reject a price on offer, whether and how to pay commission to salespeople and so on.</P>
<P>The monthly management accounts supplied to managers are used by them for decision-making. However, the way in which the information is presented is often not helpful for this purpose. For instance, costs may be classified in a way that does not allow their recalculation on the basis of an alternative course of action.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>This chapter will illustrate a series of calculations around this subject that enable managers to tread their way safely through these difficulties. These are essential, interesting and powerful tools. In the following pages we will work through a number of examples that show their application.</P></DIV>

<P>The crucial facts are:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>this company has only one product, which it sells for a unit price of $200</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>it plans to manufacture and sell 1000 units in the coming year at a profit of $20 each</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>the total cost of $180 consists of the elements shown in <A title="Figure&nbsp;15.1.&nbsp;Summary budget of Lawnmowers Ltd" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch15.html#ch15fig01"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 15.1</FONT></A>.</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>The company has received an offer from a very large retailer to purchase 200 extra units at the special price of $160. The sales manager is faced with the dilemma of whether the company can sell at a price that is below the calculated total cost and still bring benefit to the company. (Of course the marketing implications of selling at a special low price are very significant, but, for this exercise, they will be ignored in order to tease out the financial aspects.)</P>
<P>We instinctively know that the total cost as shown in the budget will change if the forecast number of units is changed. The manager could, therefore, recalculate the total cost per unit after allowing for the extra volume of 200 units. This would give a revised overall profit.</P>
<P>A decision could be made on the basis of this type of calculation, but it would not help much in determining the lowest price that could be charged in a really competitive situation. Neither would it be of very much use for producing a whole set of scenarios for sales of different volumes at different prices.</P>
<P>An alternative approach is illustrated in the following pages.</P>

This well-known classification uses the following terms:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P><STRONG><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Fixed costs:</STRONG></SPAN>&nbsp;</STRONG>These are costs where the total expenditure does not change with the level of activity. For instance rent of a factory will not increase or decrease if volume of throughput goes up or down by 10 percent.</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P><STRONG><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Variable costs:</STRONG></SPAN>&nbsp;</STRONG>These vary directly with changes in output. The cost of materials consumed in the product will vary almost in direct proportion to changes in volume.</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>An interesting paradox is that a fully variable cost is always a fixed charge per unit irrespective of volume. On the other hand, fixed costs charged to each unit fall with volume increases.</P>
<P>In practice, there are very few, if any, costs that are either totally fixed or totally variable across the whole range of possible outputs. However, it is useful for our example to make some simplifying assumptions. The fixed and variable costs for Lawnmowers Ltd are shown in <A title="Figure&nbsp;15.2.&nbsp;Fixed and variable costs for Lawnmowers Ltd" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch15.html#ch15fig02"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 15.2</FONT></A>.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;15.3.&nbsp;Alternative costing approaches applied to Lawnmowers Ltd&#8217;s figures</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>In the traditional breakdown the unit selling price of $200 is split into:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>variable cost $120</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>fixed cost $60</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>profit $20.</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>With the contribution approach, however, the selling price is split into just two components:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>variable cost of $120</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>contribution of $80.</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>Contribution, therefore, replaces the figures of fixed cost of $60 and profit of $20. We remove the fixed cost charge from the product. The concept of contribution is important and useful. It is worthwhile spending some time examining it.</P>

<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Cash flow and contribution" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>We have arrived at the contribution figure of $80 by adding back the fixed cost of $60 to the profit of $20. However, we can see that the same figure is arrived at when we deduct variable cost from the selling price, i.e. $200 &#8211; $120. This latter definition is the most useful one.</P>
<P>We will extract cash flow meaning from it. Each extra unit sold at the budget price results in a cash in-flow of $200. However, this extra unit also increases variable costs by $120. These are direct cash costs which will give rise to a corresponding cash out-flow. One extra unit sold gives rise to extra revenue of $200 and extra cash costs of $120. The difference of $80, which we call contribution, is the net cash in-flow resulting from an extra unit sold.</P>
<P>The $80 cash sacrificed from the loss of one unit is even more obvious. If the company suffers the loss of one unit it loses $200 revenue but it saves only $120. So the cash loss is $80.</P>
<P>Contribution can therefore be defined as the net cash flow from a single transaction. In other words, it is the cash gained from the sale of an extra unit or the cash lost from the sale of one unit less.</P>
<P>The relationship of contribution to profit will be pursued in the following pages.<A id=iddle1209 class=indexterm></A></P></DIV>

It shows two water tanks that represent volumes of fixed costs and profit respectively. The fixed cost tank has a capacity of $60,000 representing the total fixed costs of the company. Each unit sold pumps $80 into this tank. When a sufficient number of $80s have filled this tank with cash, then all the extra contribution overflows into the profit tank.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;15.4.&nbsp;Contribution&#8217;s relationship to fixed costs and profit</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>It is easy to see that the cash from the first 750 units (750 &#215; $80 = $60,000) remains in the fixed cost tank, it is only the cash from units in excess of 750 that goes to profit. If the company sells its budgeted volume of 1,000 units, then the final 250 units will provide profits of $20,000 (250 &#215; $80). So the budgeted profit figure is not built up at the stated rate of $20 per unit. Rather it accrues at the rate ot $80 per unit after fixed costs have been covered.</P>
<P>This important figure of $80 is referred to as contribution per unit (CPU). It is used a great deal in profit/volume calculations and you will find it to be a very useful tool of analysis.</P>
<P><A title="Figure&nbsp;15.4.&nbsp;Contribution&#8217;s relationship to fixed costs and profit" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch15.html#ch15fig04"><FONT color=#0066cc>Figure 15.4</FONT></A> also highlights a second important concept, which is <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>total contribution</STRONG></SPAN>. The total contribution in this plant is $80,000. In the upper part of the diagram it is shown as &#8216;units multiplied by CPU&#8217;. In the lower part, the same figure is produced from &#8216;fixed costs plus profit&#8217;. We will find ourselves making use of this formula in many situations.</P>

<P><A id=iddle1092 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1210 class=indexterm></A>The two definitions of total contribution mentioned can be combined in an important equation, as shown in <A title="Figure&nbsp;15.5.&nbsp;Working out the effects of change using contribution per unit for Lawnmowers Ltd" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch15.html#ch15fig05"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 15.5</FONT></A>.</P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Units</STRONG></SPAN> &#215; <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>CPU = fixed cost + profit</STRONG></SPAN></P></DIV>
<P>This view of the cost dynamics of the company facilitates calculations to do with volume, cost and profits. For instance, we can start at units, and ascertain without difficulty what the profit would be at any level of unit sales. Alternatively we can work from the profit side and ask what unit sales are needed to deliver any desired level of profit. Finally we can combine price and volume changes and instantly translate them into profit.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>For instance:</P>
<DIV class=orderedlist>
<OL class=orderedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>What profit would result from an increase in sales of 10 percent?</P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Answer</STRONG></SPAN> $28,000</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>How many units must be sold to provide a profit of $32,000?</P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Answer</STRONG></SPAN> 1,150 units</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>Finally, a very important question, how many units must be sold to break even, i.e., make neither a profit nor a loss?</P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Answer</STRONG></SPAN> 750 units.</P></LI></OL></DIV>
<P>This latter calculation gives the break-even point, a concept that is used widely in business. The formula for its calculation in terms of units is derived directly from the above equation. We simply set profit equal to zero and solve for the number of units. We will look at this concept some more in the following pages.</P>
<P>It is important to remember that we are still thinking in terms of physical units. The formulae and methods illustrated above work only in the case of a business that sells one type of unit. However, these limited formulae provide a useful stepping off point for the next stage. As soon as the fundamentals have been grasped, it is possible to move easily to the more general case where we can do calculations for a company that produces many different units.<A id=iddle1178 class=indexterm></A></P>

It is the level at which the company makes neither a loss nor a profit, but just covers its fixed costs. It is, therefore, a most important cross-over point in a plant&#8217;s level of activity and managers pay much attention to it.</P></DIV>
<P>The break-even chart is a well-known illustration of the concept. It shows the relationship between three important components over the total possible range of outputs:</P>

<P>The vertical axis is used to plot costs and revenue. Figures from Lawn-mowers Ltd are used for each of the three components (fixed costs, variable costs and revenue). These are plotted in three separate charts in <A title="Figure&nbsp;15.6.&nbsp;The elements of a break-even chart" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch15.html#ch15fig06"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 15.6</FONT></A>.</P>

<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Chart A</STRONG></SPAN> illustrates the fixed costs, represented by a horizontal line at the $60,000 point on the vertical axis. This line is absolutely horizontal because fixed costs do not go up or down with changes in the level of output.</P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Chart B</STRONG></SPAN> illustrates the variable costs. At zero output there are no variable costs, but, with each unit sold, the total grows by $120. At 600 units variable costs amount to $72,000. The relationship with output is strictly linear, hence the straight line sloping upwards.</P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Chart C</STRONG></SPAN> illustrates the revenue. Again, at zero output, total revenue is zero. For every unit sold, revenue increases by $200. At 600 units, total revenue amounts to $120 000 (600 &#215; $200). The relationship between revenue and output is also linear, and this is reflected in the more rapidly rising total revenue line.</P>

First we see the band of fixed costs at the base of the chart. Positioned above this is the variable costs wedge. Along the upper boundary of this wedge is the total cost line. Finally, the total revenue line is shown rising from the zero revenue at zero output up through the two areas of cost until it breaks through the total cost line about 50 percent of capacity.

<P>The break-even point here occurs at a level of 750 units which equates to revenue of $150,000. Remember from <A title="Figure&nbsp;15.5.&nbsp;Working out the effects of change using contribution per unit for Lawnmowers Ltd" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch15.html#ch15fig05"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 15.5</FONT></A> that 750 units will result in a contribution of $60,000 (750 &#215; $80), which just equals the fixed cost.</P>
<P>A line is plotted representing the budgeted sales of 1,000 units at a unit price of $200. This puts the company a little way to the right of the break-even point. The surplus output over break even is sometimes referred to as the &#8216;margin of safety&#8217;. This margin of safety here is 25 percent, which means that sales can fall by this percentage before the break-even point is reached.</P>
<P>A number of simplifying assumptions are incorporated into this chart. It has been assumed that (1) fixed costs are totally fixed for all levels of output, (2) that unit variable costs do not change irrespective of numbers produced and (3) that unit revenue is the same for all levels of sales. These assumptions may be valid over a fairly narrow range on each side of existing levels of activity. At very low or very high levels, however, the assumptions break down and the chart ceases to be accurate.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding these limitations, the break-even chart is a useful tool for presenting information, for explaining the dynamics of a production unit, for pointing out the essential features of the volume, cost and revenue system and for setting minimum sales targets.</P>

The first (A) has a high operating leverage. With high fixed costs and low unit variable costs it has a total cost line that starts high on the chart but has a relatively flat trajectory. The total revenue line cuts the total cost line at quite a wide angle, which means that profit increases rapidly to the right of the break-even point. Unfortunately, to the left of this point, the negative gap also widens rapidly, meaning that the company gets into heavy losses very quickly as output falls away.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;15.8.&nbsp;Operating leverage</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>The second (B) has a low operating leverage. This company has low fixed costs but high unit variable costs. The total cost line starts low but climbs steeply with increased volume. The total revenue line produces a much narrower angle at the crossover point, indicating that both profits and losses grow more slowly either right or left of the break-even point.</P>
<P>In Company A, we can understand there is intense pressure to achieve volume sales in order to move out of the heavy loss situation to the left of the break-even point. And when the break-even point has been reached, there is the prize of a rapidly increasing profit figure to provide the incentive to achieve even greater volume. When total production capacity exceeds total demand, fierce price competition can erupt between firms of this type as they compete for volume. The companies with this cost profile are those with heavy fixed assets, such as steel and transport companies.</P>
<P>The second situation, with low operating leverage, is frequently found to exist in companies with smaller, flexible production systems and low fixed assets. These companies tend to have less risk, but also less reward, attached to them.</P></DIV></DIV>

However one extra calculation has been added. The contribution figure of $80 is expressed as a percentage of the selling price of $200 to give the answer 40 percent.</P>
<P>This is a very important percentage and a very important ratio. It has several different names in financial literature, such as, profit to volume (PV) ratio. As we have used the term &#8216;contribution per unit&#8217; (CPU) when dealing with units, we will for consistency adopt the term &#8216;contribution percentage of sales&#8217; (CPS) for this value.</P></DIV>

<P>The selling prices of products are determined not by cost but by the market-place. Most companies do not have the luxury of fixing prices to give secure margins, they must accept or reject, within a range, the generally accepted price. For some products, the prices will be more satisfactory than for others.</P>
<P>A single product can have more than one price as discounts are given to bulk purchasers and so on. Therefore, the &#8216;contribution to sales percentage&#8217; will vary widely for different products and in different markets. The overall contribution to sales percentage is a weighted average of the individual CPSs of the separate products and markets.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;15.12.&nbsp;Overall contribution to sales percentage as a weighted average for a mix of sales</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>The contribution for sales through the direct channel is $150 per unit, to yield a CPS of 30 percent. Sales through agents give a contribution of only $50, to yield a CPS of 12.5 percent.</P>
<P>As shown in Box 3, with revenues budgeted at $300,000 for direct sales and at $100,000 for agent sales the average CPS for all sales amounts to 25.6 percent.</P>
<P>In Box 4 it is shown what happens when sales to agents increase substantially. The average CPS falls to 19 percent. A change in the mix of sales has brought on a dramatic fall in the weighted CPS. The result in this exaggerated example is that a significant increase in sales volume has not produced a corresponding increase in profit.</P>
<P>Many companies work on the basis of average values. This can be dangerous. The average is determined by the mix of high and low contribution products and this mix must be managed. This point is illustrated more fully in the next section.</P></DIV>

There are, therefore, six product-market segments as shown in the matrix in the top right-hand corner. The contribution to sales percentage for each segment is shown in the matrix in the upper right-hand corner.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;15.13.&nbsp;Product mix</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>Budgeted and actual sales of the product market segments are shown. Beneath these, the contributions from the two sets of data have been calculated.</P>
<P>As shown by the arrows, the sales value in each segment is multiplied by its corresponding CPS to arrive at its contribution. The contributions from the individual segments are accumulated to give the total contribution.</P>
<P>Fixed costs are $75,000 for both budgeted and actual results, and these are deducted to give the final budgeted and actual profit. A budgeted profit of $16,000 has turned into an actual loss of $1,000.</P>
<P>In comparing budgeted with actual figures, note the following:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>total revenue of $300,000 is unchanged</P>
<LI class=listitem>

<P>budgeted profit is converted into an actual loss.</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>The sole reason for this adverse turnaround is to be found in the mix of products.</P>
<P>The bulk of sales has moved from high to low contribution segments. For example, in the bottom right-hand last segment, which has the lowest CPS value (product C sold through agents), sales have increased from a budgeted $20,000 to an actual $60,000. This increase has been offset by reductions in the better segments. Similar other adverse movements can be identified. The overall product mix has been diluted and the company has suffered grievously.</P>

It is difficult to exaggerate the importance to a company&#8217;s financial health of directing sales away from low to high contribution areas.</P>
<P>However this is not the end of the story. This technique alone will not always succeed in maximizing contribution. There are situations in which the promotion of sales of products with high CPS is not to the advantage of the company.</P>
<P>This is often true when a company is working close to maximum capacity and when different products are competing for this capacity. In such situations, additional output of one product means a reduction in the output of another. So a gain from one product may be more than offset by loss from the other.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="A Step beyond contribution to sales percentage" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>Consider a manufacturing situation where a high-value machine is used to manufacture two products, each of which sells for $5,000 (see <A title="Figure&nbsp;15.14.&nbsp;Selling price to cost relationships of products A and B" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch15.html#ch15fig14"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 15.14</FONT></A>). Product A has a CPS of 30 percent while that of product B is 20 percent. The absolute contribution from product A is $1,500 and from product B is $1,000.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;15.14.&nbsp;Selling price to cost relationships of products A and B</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>From all that has been said so far, it would seem that management should always favor product A over product B. However, it is possible for product B to be more profitable than product A. How can this be?</P>
<P>When a company is operating at, or close to, maximum capacity, a further calculation beyond CPS is necessary. We extract a value that we call &#8216;contribution per unit of capacity&#8217; or &#8216;contribution per unit of the limiting factor&#8217;. It can be a great identifier of sources of profit to a company, and so it will be explored in the next section.</P></DIV>

We will assume that the machine can (after allowing for downtime, maintenance, cleaning and so on) deliver 2,000 productive hours per annum.

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;15.15.&nbsp;Contribution per machine hour of products A and B</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>We start our analysis by looking at what proportion of this capacity is used by each product, and we then relate this usage of capacity to the total contribution of each product.</P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Product A</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P>One unit of product A takes 10 hours of machine capacity. The total contribution of this unit is $1,500. Therefore, the contribution per hour (CPH) of this product is $150. The capacity of the machine, remember, is 2,000 hours per annum, so, at $150 per hour, the maximum contribution attainable from the machine for this product in one year is $300,000.</P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Product B</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P>One unit of product B takes four hours of machine capacity. The total contribution of this unit is $1,000. Therefore, the CPH of this product is $250. At $250 per hour, the maximum contribution attainable from the machine for this product in one year is $500,000.</P>
<P>Product B is by far the more profitable product in this situation, even though it has a lower CPS.</P>
<P>The determining conditions for these circumstances to exist is that capacity is limited, and there is competition between products for this capacity. In this situation contribution will be maximized &#8211; and, therefore, so will profit &#8211; when activity is directed into those products that have, not the highest contribution to sales percentage, but the highest contribution per hour value.</P>
<P>We have discussed here a specific instance of the more general case referred to as &#8216;contribution per unit of the limiting factor&#8217;. The limiting factor is the constraint that puts a ceiling on output. Machine hours are the most common limitation, but there can be others, such as raw materials, or working capital.</P>
<P>Errors are frequently made in pricing products without reference to this concept.</P></DIV></DIV>

<P><A id=iddle1616 class=indexterm></A>The need for a company to earn a return on its investment has been covered in detail. It is clear that this return must meet market expectations if the standing and value of the company is not to suffer.</P>
<P>One of management&#8217;s critical functions is planning the future of the business to ensure that an adequate rate of return is maintained. Essential to this is adequate new productive investment, as it is the return on this new investment that will provide the ongoing profits on which the company depends. Therefore a careful selection process needs to be applied to competing investment proposals so that only the best qualify.</P>
<P>In the past, many approaches have been adopted to assist managers in this selection. One very well tried and tested one that is still in use, is &#8216;pay-back&#8217;. Simply calculate the number of years that the project will take to pay back the money invested in it. As a rule of thumb it can provide a useful &#8216;fix&#8217; on a project. However, it is not a mathematically sound approach. Some accounting-type measures have also been used in the past that are mathematically suspect.</P>

The investor hopes that the in-flows will both repay the initial investment and yield an adequate surplus. The problem has been how to relate the immediate cash outlay with the stream of future repayments so as to determine the true rate of return.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;16.1.&nbsp;Investment profiles</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>In section B of <A title="Figure&nbsp;16.1.&nbsp;Investment profiles" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch16.html#ch16fig01"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 16.1</FONT></A>, the financial numbers are given for Investment &#8216;X&#8217;. The investment is $1,000 and the stream of repayments over five years add up to $2,000. What, then, is the rate of return on the investment (ROI)? The increase in value over the five years is 100 percent, which could be interpreted as 20 percent per annum. Is this a correct interpretation? Is the return adequate and how is it affected by inflation? These are the questions investors commonly ask. Before answering them, let us look at one more example.</P>
<P>Section C of <A title="Figure&nbsp;16.1.&nbsp;Investment profiles" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch16.html#ch16fig01"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 16.1</FONT></A> shows the cash flows of Investment &#8216;Y&#8217;. The investment here of $1,000 and total repayments of $2,000 is the same as before. However, the pattern of repayments is quite different. For each of the first four years the cash in-flows are $200 but in Year 5 the initial investment of $1,000 is repaid in addition to the annual amount of $200. In other words an investment of $1,000 gives an annual return of $200 and, at the end of its life, the original investment of $1,000 is also repaid in full. This is the pattern of cash flows we would realize if we were to invest in a fixed interest security yielding 20 percent. The true return on this project is 20 percent.</P>
<P>When we look back at Investment X, we see that we do not get our investment back in one lump at the end of the period &#8211; it is spread over each year. The yearly cash repayments, then, are both paying interest on the investments and repaying the principal. This is the pattern of returns given by a commercial investment such as a piece of equipment that wears out to nothing over a five year period. The return to the investor here cannot be assessed so easily.</P></DIV>

As already stated the cash flows tend to follow the pattern of a large cash out-flow followed by a stream of smaller cash in-flows over a series of future time periods.</P>
<P>We designate these periods as:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>Period 0: today</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>Period 1: one year hence</P>

<P>We know instinctively that money to be received at some distant time in the future has not the same worth as money in our hands now. This is the well-known principle referred to as &#8216;The time value of money&#8217;. Because of it we cannot make direct comparisons between sums of money that fall into different time periods.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Project appraisal &#8211; steps to a solution (1)" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>We have to use a mechanism to express the value of all cash flows at one specific time period. The period most often selected is Period 0.</P>
<P>This approach is illustrated in <A title="Figure&nbsp;16.2.&nbsp;Project appraisal &#8211; setting out the problem" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch16.html#ch16fig02"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 16.2</FONT></A>. Each of the future cash flows is converted into what is called its &#8216;present value&#8217; by the application of a &#8216;discount factor&#8217;. The means of calculating this discount factor is shown in the next section.</P>
<DIV class=figure-float style="FLOAT: left">

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;16.2.&nbsp;Project appraisal &#8211; setting out the problem</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>These present values are now directly comparable. They have been standardized. They are summed together to give a total present value of all future cash in-flows. This amount in turn can be directly compared with the investment&#8217;s initial cash out-flow. From this comparison we come to a conclusion about the worth of the investment project.</P></DIV>

But how much less?</P></DIV>
<P>We can approach this question by asking the question &#8216;If I had $100 available for deposit in the bank at an interest rate of 10 percent, what would it be worth one year from now?&#8217; The answer is of course $110.</P>
<P>Therefore $100 is the <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>present value</STRONG></SPAN> of $110 due in year 1 at a rate of 10 percent (expressed as a decimal = 0.1). We can bring any value back from the future to the present by applying a factor related to the interest rate. In this case we divide the future value by (1 + decimal interest rate), i.e. $110/ 1.1 = $100. <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>(It is mathematically identical to multiply by the discount factor .909, i.e., 1/1.1.)</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P>If the future cash flow was positioned in Period 2, then we would have to do the calculation twice, i.e. <SPAN class=inlinemediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/248equ01.gif" height=21></SPAN>.

<P>Centrally placed is the box showing $100 which is aligned with the Period 0. Periods going forward into the future and back into the past are shown on the right- and left-hand sides of zero respectively. An interest rate of 10 percent is used here to keep things simple. As we move to the right of the central zero point, the interest factors are 1.100, 1.210 and 1.331, which is 10 percent compounded for years +1, +2 and +3.</P>
<P>When applied to the sum of $100 they tell us that the equivalent is $133.1 at the end of Year 3.</P>
<P>To the left of the model, the factors are 0.909, 0.826 and 0.751. This last one tells us that $100 carried back three years has a present value of $75.1.</P>
<P>The investment appraisal technique relies mainly on the factors to the left of center, i.e. the discount factors.</P>

<P>To carry out our analysis we first select an appropriate interest rate. A higher rate would give a lower discount factor and vice versa. (See <A title="Appendix&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Discounting and compounding tables" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/apd.html"><FONT color=#0066cc>appendix 4</FONT></A> for relevant interest rate tables.) We can calculate the present or future value of any sum of money due in any period past or future by using such tables.</P></DIV></DIV>

<P><A id=iddle1568 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1678 class=indexterm></A>In <A title="Figure&nbsp;16.5.&nbsp;Project appraisal &#8211; calculating present value 2" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch16.html#ch16fig05"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 16.5</FONT></A> we have set up a schedule for a hypothetical bank loan that carries an interest rate of 10 percent. The amount of the loan is equal to the project NPV of $5,309. The loan repayment schedule shows payments that are equal to the project&#8217;s cash flows of $1,500, $3,500, and $1,400.</P>
<P>Over the period of the loan the bank charges annual interest at the rate of 10 percent on the outstanding balance. The schedule shows for each of the three years:</P>
<DIV class=orderedlist>
<OL class=orderedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>the interest charge</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>the repayment and</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>the closing balance.</P></LI></OL></DIV>
<P>At the end of Year 3 the balance on the loan is exactly zero. This shows that the three repayments have done two things:</P>
<DIV class=orderedlist>
<OL class=orderedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>they have repaid in full the initial loan of $5,309 and</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>they have also paid the bank 10 percent interest each year on the amount outstanding.</P></LI></OL></DIV>
<P>The column headed &#8216;Bank cash movements&#8217; will clarify the example further. The bank has had one cash out-flow of $5,309 followed by three cash in-flows of (1) $1,500, (2)$3,500 (3) $1,400 and it has earned exactly 10 percent on the whole operation. Note that the bank has not earned 10 percent interest on $5,309 for three years, but only on the outstanding balance each year.</P>

<P>This example establishes the meaning of &#8216;Present Value&#8217;. It is the sum of money today that exactly matches a future stream of income at a given rate of interest. It is obvious that the rate of interest used directly affects the present value. A higher rate of interest produces a lower present value and vice versa.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>We will now apply these principles to our example investment project. If the initial investment were $5,309 (as in the case of the bank) the return to the investor would have been exactly 10 percent. It follows that if we can get the same returns from a smaller initial sum, i.e. $5,000, then the return is greater than 10 percent.</P>
<P>The fact that the value derived for NPV (i.e. present value of cash flows less initial investment) has come out positive means that the project is delivering a rate of return greater than the interest rate used in the calculations. If the NPV were negative, it would mean the rate delivered was less than the interest rate used.</P></DIV></DIV>

<P><A id=iddle1452 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1475 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1675 class=indexterm></A>The previous example has shown that the investment of $5,000 earns more than 10 percent. We have established that when the present value of the future cash flows exceeds the investment amount, we know that the rate of return is greater than the interest rate used in the calculation.</P>
<P>However, we do not know what actual rate of return is being delivered by the project. Of course this is very important information and further calculations are needed to establish it.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there is no mathematical way of going directly to the answer. Instead we carry out a series of tests at various rates and by degrees work our way towards the answer.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Project appraisal &#8211; internal rate of return (IRR)" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>We see this approach in <A title="Figure&nbsp;16.6.&nbsp;Calculating the internal rate of return" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch16.html#ch16fig06"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 16.6</FONT></A>. On our first test we got a positive NPV of $309 which told us that the project was delivering a return greater than 10 percent. A second test is carried out using 11 percent discount factors. The present value here is $5,216, yielding an NPV of $216 positive. We conclude that the return is greater than 11 percent.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;16.6.&nbsp;Calculating the internal rate of return</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>In section B, a schedule shows calculations for interest rate values between 10 percent and 15 percent, as listed in column 1. In the second column the present values that correspond to these different rates are $5,309, $5,216, $5,126 and so on. Note how these amounts fall in value as higher interest rates are applied. The third column has the unchanged investment figure of $5,000 in all rows. The fourth column shows the result of deducting the investment from the present value.</P>
<P>The NPV at 10 percent is $309 (positive) and at 11 percent it is $216 (positive). Going down the column, the value remains positive as far as 13 percent. At 14 percent cent it becomes negative. It becomes even more negative at 15 percent. It can be concluded from these values, then, that the investment is earning more than 13 percent and less than 14 percent. At approximately 13.5 percent, the figure in the NPV column would equal zero.</P>
<P>This value of 13.5 percent is the rate of return being earned by the project. It is referred to as the <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</STRONG></SPAN>.</P>

<P>In this chapter we have merely considered how to apply a mathematical technique once the cash flows from a project have been established.</P>
<P>In real life this is the easy part of project appraisal. It requires considerably more effort and skill to arrive at the expected cash flows. Furthermore managers will never have to physically do the calculations themselves because computer programs are available to do this for them. However, a manager must understand the reasoning behind the calculations so that he can formulate a problem correctly and interpret the results produced by the computer. The various ratios produced by these programs can help him to make sound decisions in the field of investment appraisal.</P>

<DIV class=itemizedlist>

<LI class=listitem>
<P>annual returns from project</P>

<P>rate of interest.</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>A brief description of each is given. The area for which it is hardest to input reliable data is that of &#8216;annual returns&#8217;. There are no rules for this. Common sense and business acumen must apply here. It is normal to test a series of scenarios to examine the sensitivity of the project to small changes in input variables. Over time the accuracy of predictions can be monitored and suitable filtering mechanisms adopted.

<P>Global competition, worldwide recession, and complex financial instruments have shown up weaknesses in these traditional approaches. This has given rise to a search for more precise instruments of assessment. The search has not been in vain, and there are now exciting new developments in this area.</P>
<P>The most robust of these new techniques is that most commonly known as &#8216;shareholder value added&#8217; (SVA)<A id=ch17fn01 class=footnote href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch17.html#ftn.ch17fn01"><SUP class=footnote><FONT color=#0066cc>[*]</FONT></SUP></A>, but the terms &#8216;economic value added&#8217; (EVA), and &#8216;market value added&#8217; (MVA) are also used.</P>
<P>These systems all have the same underlying approach. They adopt an economic rather than an accounting stance, and they look to the future rather than the past.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt=Introduction src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/face.jpg" width=37></DIV>
<P><SPAN class=italic>One of the problems with the purely accounting approach is that it relies largely on values that are historic. Furthermore these values are derived from accounting statements that are produced according to various accounting conventions. Often these conventions are more useful for auditing purposes rather than for performance assessment or valuation.</SPAN></P>
<P>There are other issues that traditional approaches do not address explicitly such as risk measurement and future capital investment. There is no doubt that SVA methods provide a more comprehensive and philosophically sound basis for managerial decisions than those used in the past.</P></DIV>

Cash is invested today in order to get a surplus back in the future. This future cash flow must fully repay the initial investment and also cover the cost of the funds over the period of investment. This cash flow technique has been used for many years in the assessment of capital projects (see <A title="Chapter&nbsp;16.&nbsp;Investment ratios" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch16.html"><FONT color=#0066cc>chapter 16</FONT></A>).</P>

<P>Let us say that we are faced with a capital project decision on whether we should spend $1m on a particular piece of equipment. We estimate future revenues and costs over the life of the equipment. We convert these into the extra cash in-flow that the equipment will produce. We combine that in-flow with other cash movements arising from working capital etc. Then we discount the total cash flow back to a net present value (NPV). We use that figure to assess the financial value of the investment.</P>
<P>The shareholder value approach is to use the same technique to assess the value of a company&#8217;s operations either in whole or in part.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt=Description src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/tickmark.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>However in regard to a company special considerations apply:</P>
<DIV class=orderedlist>
<OL class=orderedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>The returns from a company cannot be so neatly packaged as those from a single piece of equipment. In a company there will be many different operations each giving rise to a separate cash flow.</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>With a single piece of equipment there is usually a very definite and limited life span, but not so with a company.</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>In straightforward project appraisal, a very pragmatic approach to the selection of a discount factor is common. But what discount factor should be applied to the cash flows of a company overall? This is a very important consideration because the factor chosen will have a major bearing on the assessment.</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>Companies can be funded in many different ways. Various mixtures of equity and loan capital are used. How can these differences be accommodated?</P></LI></OL></DIV>

<P>For this exercise we will assume that all of the items included in operating assets will respond spontaneously to changes in sales volume.</P>
<P>This assumption is reasonable for items in the &#8216;net working capital&#8217; category. There is a direct linear relationship between &#8216;Accounts receivable&#8217; and the level of sales.

These are the three principal items in the NWC category.</P>
<P>In the case of &#8216;Cash&#8217; we distinguish between the basic amount required for operating requirements and surpluses held for other purposes. This basic operating amount is a very small percentage of total assets and it can be loosely linked to volume of activity.</P>

<P>We will illustrate this for our example company using some very simple assumptions, such as a constant growth in sales of 10 percent.</P>
<P>There will be two main components to the cash flow:</P>

<P>We know that cash flow from a trading operation can be defined as net profit plus depreciation. Should we not therefore add back depreciation to our cash flows? Strictly speaking, the answer is &#8216;yes&#8217;.</P></DIV>
<P>However in our simple illustration, we ignore this adjustment both in the income statement and again when we come to look at investment in fixed assets. In the latter case by taking only the net increase we ignore the investment required to maintain a constant level of assets. This could be equated to the depreciation charge. Consequently these two items cancel out.<A id=iddle1564 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1581 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1604 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1635 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1793 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1846 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1848 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1898 class=indexterm></A></P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Tax:</STRONG></SPAN> We have charged tax at the full rate on operating profit.

<P>If our newly determined value is greater than the investment shown in the balance sheet, then value has been created.

<P>All the funds used to support the business have a cost. This cost is obvious in the case of loan funds. They carry a precise (but maybe varying) interest rate and their cost has always been charged against the profits of an operation.</P>
<P>In the case of common stock (equity) the cost is just as real but it has not always been so obvious. Indeed it is one of the main criticisms of more traditional methods of assessment that this cost has not been made more explicit and charged against operations. In the SVA method of assessment the cost of equity is fully assessed and charged. The method employed is to use a discount factor based on the weighted average cost of capital.</P>

<P>These four values are used to derive an appropriate cost of equity for a specific company. See section D of <A title="Figure&nbsp;17.10.&nbsp;Capital asset pricing model" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch17.html#ch17fig10"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 17.10</FONT></A>. The formula is:</P>
<P>Cost of equity (company k) = Risk-free rate + [Market premium &#215; beta-k] 13.6 % = 8 % + [ 4.5 % &#215; 1.25 ]</P>

This WACC figure is of crucial importance. It represents the long-term hurdle rate that a company must exceed for sustainable achievement.</P>
<P>We will here introduce the term ROIC (return on invested capital). (For a full description refer to <A title="Appendix&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Special items" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/apa.html"><FONT color=#0066cc>appendix 1</FONT></A>.)</P>
<P>This is another means of measuring performance that is similiar to ROTA. We use a new measure here because we must adopt a definition of assets that corresponds to the funds base used for calculating the cost of capital.</P>

<P>The relationship between a company&#8217;s ROIC and its WACC is the key variable that determines its success measured in SVA terms (see <A title="Figure&nbsp;17.12.&nbsp;Alternative scenarios: creating and destroying value" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch17.html#ch17fig12"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 17.12</FONT></A>).</P></DIV>

<P>If we were to look at a company that had a WACC of 10 percent and an ROIC of 12 percent we would know that value is being created. This excess value should be reflected in the company&#8217;s market capitalization.</P>
<P>With a zero growth expectation we could expect to see the market value of the company at 20 percent above its book value. However if we add growth to the equation this value increases rapidly (see <A title="Figure&nbsp;17.11.&nbsp;How value is affected when return on invested capital (ROIC) is greater than weighted average cost of capital (WACC)" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch17.html#ch17fig11"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 17.11</FONT></A>).</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;17.11.&nbsp;How value is affected when return on invested capital (ROIC) is greater than weighted average cost of capital (WACC)</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>The reason for the upward curve is as follows. Where there is zero growth, earnings are constant and each year they can be paid out in full. So the return is similiar to that of a high-yielding fixed interest bond. The price of such a bond is determined by its return relative to its required yield. There is a premium of 20 percent in this situation.</P>
<P>However where some of the earnings are not paid out but in order to achieve growth are re-invested at the premium rate the effect on value is compounded. The funds that are re-invested earn a higher rate of return than they would if they had been paid out. The higher the rate of retention and re-investment the greater will be the effect on value.</P>
<P>But all this assumes that the company can re-invest at the premium ROIC. For these conditions to apply, the company must have a strong strategic position in a high-growth market.<A id=iddle1433 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1787 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1889 class=indexterm></A></P></DIV>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;17.12.&nbsp;Alternative scenarios: creating and destroying value</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>In <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>section A</STRONG></SPAN> the chart, repeated from <A title="Figure&nbsp;17.11.&nbsp;How value is affected when return on invested capital (ROIC) is greater than weighted average cost of capital (WACC)" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch17.html#ch17fig11"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 17.11</FONT></A>, shows the interaction of growth with a high rate of return. We can see that the really successful company is one of high growth and an ROIC in excess of WACC.</P>
<P>A relatively small number of companies occupy this position for more than a short period of time. Such companies attract strong competition which almost invariably erodes their competitive advantage. There are economic laws that tend to push companies into a position where ROIC almost exactly equals WACC.</P>
<P>In <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>section B</STRONG></SPAN> we see the dramatic negative impact that growth has on the value of low profit companies. There are not many companies that persist with overall high growth and with low profitability, but within individual companies there are nearly always divisions, business units or single products that have these characteristics. They reduce the value of the total company. Very often this factor is not easily seen from the figures presented to management. The real worth of shareholder value analysis lies in the light that it throws on these situations.</P>
<P>In <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>section C</STRONG></SPAN> we have a situation where ROIC is exactly equal to WACC. Here growth has no effect on value. Intuitively it can be difficult to accept this concept.</P>
<P>The reason for this phenomenon is that growth almost always requires extra investment. The funds for this extra investment will have to be paid for at the WACC rate. Extra profits will be earned at the ROIC rate. Where these are exactly equal, they cancel one another out. Therefore no extra benefit accrues to the existing shareholders. Growth has not added value.</P>

<P><SPAN class=italic>In economics we are taught that extra increments of investment will continue to be made so long as the extra returns exceed the extra costs, but the return will be less with each increment. Equilibrium is reached only when the extra returns and costs are equal. We will use this concept to put a value on a company at a specific future time.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>

<P><A id=iddle1794 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1849 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1899 class=indexterm></A>The second important issue we did not fully deal with is the question of terminal value. We simply assumed this to be ten times the amount of profit in the final year.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Terminal (continuing) value" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>We need a more soundly based approach than this. We will use the ROIC &#8211; WACC relationship to direct us towards a logical solution.</P>
<P>Management&#8217;s objective is to implement strategies that will give their company a competitive advantage that will allow it to earn a return greater than WACC. Where they achieve this premium return they add value for the shareholders.</P>
<P>However this premium return will inevitably attract competition that will whittle away its advantage over time. Without some competitive advantage a company will not continue to earn premium profits, so its ROIC will fall back to the level of WACC. Of course, good management will continuously seek to put in place new strategies that will restore the advantage.</P>

<P>The valuation approach we use here is one that measures the value of the company as it now stands with its existing strategies.</P></DIV>
<P>In shareholder value analysis we assess the number of years forward for which current strategies will continue to add value. At the end of that &#8216;horizon period&#8217; there will be equality between ROIC and WACC. Further growth beyond that date will not add value. We make this the point where we assess the continuing or terminal value of the company.</P>
<P>To calculate the terminal value we simply take the cash flow in that final year and assess it as we would value an annuity. That is we divide the cash flow by the cost of capital. When we use this more logically sound approach in our example we produce a value somewhat in excess of the earlier shortcut approach. See <A title="Figure&nbsp;17.13.&nbsp;Calculating terminal value" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch17.html#ch17fig13"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 17.13</FONT></A>.</P>

<P>Alpha is a longstanding successful company with a large customer base. The main product that it supplies is high-quality aluminum and steel guttering. However, sales growth has been less than buoyant in recent years.</P>
<P>Beta is a newer company that supplies a largely similar product manufactured from a specialized polymer material originally developed for the automotive industry. For a number of years now it has shown good growth and has made considerable inroads into this general market segment.</P>
<P>The management of Alpha has made preliminary approaches to the Beta team regarding a possible link-up and these have not been rebuffed. Both parties agree that for a merger to be successfully negotiated it would have to be shown that both sets of shareholders would benefit.</P></DIV>

<P>Beta has 13.6 million shares on issue. Therefore, Alpha will have to issue (13.6/2.5) 5.44 million shares in exchange. Alpha shares have a value of $37.5 each, so the price offered for Beta Inc. amounts to (5.44 * $37.5) $204m, which is exactly equal to its current market capitalization.</P>

<P>This figure of $2.49 highlights the first major effect that the acquisition can have, i.e. a significant increase in EPS for the acquiring company. Alpha shareholders earned $2.14 per share prior to the merger but they would earn $2.49 per share if this proposal were to be implemented. If all other things were equal, this jump of 16 percent in EPS would drive up the market price of Alpha shares.</P>
<P>We will now explore the reasons behind this phenomenon.</P></DIV>

<H1 class=title><A id=ch18lev1sec5></A>Acquisition impact on EPS</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P><A id=iddle1549 class=indexterm></A>It is the relative price to earnings ratios of the two shares that are the key to understanding the increase in EPS of Alpha Inc.</P>

<P>When company A acquires company B by means of a straight exchange of shares and when that exchange is made exactly at the market prices of the two shares, then if company A has a higher price to earnings ratio than company B, company A gains an automatic increase in EPS.</P></DIV>
<P>The reasons are easy to explain. Prior to the acquisition, Alpha Inc. had EAT of $27m. Post-acquisition, these profits have risen to $45m, i.e. an increase of 66 percent. However, the increase in the number of shares has only been 5.44 million on the 12.6 million original issued shares in Alpha Inc., i.e. an increase of 43 percent.</P>

PE was 17.5 times, the corresponding number for Beta Inc. was 11.4 times, and it this difference in PE values that has enabled Alpha Inc. to acquire 66 percent extra profit for an increase of only 43 percent in the number of shares (see <A title="Figure&nbsp;18.6.&nbsp;Effects of merger on earnings per share" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch18.html#ch18fig06"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 18.6</FONT></A>).</P>

<P>Thus a company on a high PE has a great advantage in the acquisition process.</P>
<P>But we must also consider what has been the impact on Beta Inc. These shareholders have exchanged 2.5 old Beta shares for one new Alpha share.</P>
<P>We see in <A title="Figure&nbsp;18.3.&nbsp;Financial accounts 2001 &#8212; Beta Inc." class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch18.html#ch18fig03"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 18.3</FONT></A> that prior to the acquisition each Beta share commanded an EPS of $1.33. Accordingly for 2.5 shares they should expect to receive $3.3 (2.5 * $1.32) from each new Alpha share. In fact they receive only $2.49. This number translates back to $0.99 for each share that they have surrendered, which represents a loss of 24 percent.</P>
<P>Therefore, in terms of the important measure of EPS, Alpha shareholders have benefited to the extent of 16 percent, while Beta shareholders have suffered a loss of 24 percent.</P>
<P>There are other variables of interest to both sets of shareholders that are also affected by the merger, and these will now be explored.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=figure-float style="FLOAT: left">

<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Outcome to shareholders of original offer" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/c18nf010.gif" width=350></DIV></DIV>
<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;18.10.&nbsp;Outcome to shareholders of original offer</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>Apart from the prices per share which remain unchanged for both parties, all the financial gains from the acquisition accrue to the Alpha shareholders and all the losses to the Beta shareholders.</P>
<P>The sole reason for this outcome is that Alpha Inc. has a much higher PE (price earnings ratio) than Beta Inc. and the shares were exchanged on the basis of their relative market prices.</P>
<P>So a high PE is a very powerful weapon in a takeover contest. In fact it is pretty well impossible for a low PE company to acquire another using shares for all or part of the consideration.</P>
<P>But to return to our Alpha/Beta example, while all the gains go to the Alpha shareholders it is not likely that the Beta shareholders will buy into the proposal. First because there is a 20 per cent loss in dividend. The losses in the areas of earnings and assets (EPS and APS) may be of more interest to management, but to the investor the total market value of the shares and the annual dividend paid are the crucial issues.</P>
<P>So if Alpha Inc. really desires to acquire Beta Inc. an increased offer will be necessary. This new offer could be a mixture of shares and cash, all cash, or simply a greater number of shares.</P>
<P>The possible combinations are endless, but overleaf we have put together an increased offer of 6.5 million shares and an increase in the dividend that appears to give Beta shareholders what they would require, i.e. increased market value and no loss of dividend. At the same time, it gives to Alpha Inc. a very desirable increase in earnings per share.</P></DIV>

<P><A id=iddle1025 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1642 class=indexterm></A>Alpha has got a considerable advantage in share price and in order to reap the benefits of a merger it can afford to pass some gains in market value to the acquired company.</P>
<P>We have not yet gone into any detail about what the new share price will be. It will be determined by the investing community, who will decide on a new price to earnings ratio depending on how they view such matters as &#8216;goodness of fit&#8217;, etc.</P>
<P>We could consider four possible outcomes for this new PE:</P>
<DIV class=orderedlist>

<LI class=listitem>
<P>Equal to Alpha Inc.</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>Equal to Beta Inc.</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>Average of Alpha and Beta</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>Any number, probably falling between Alpha and Beta.</P></LI></OL></DIV>
<P>For this exercise we conservatively assume the average as in outcome 3 above.</P>
<P>This states that the post-merger market value of the combined company will simply equal the aggregate of the two separate companies prior to the merger. Our calculations below are based on this assumption.</P>
<P>The new offer proposed has the following two elements:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>Number of shares 6.5 million instead of 5.44 million</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>Increase in dividend payout of 17.5 percent</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>The effect of this new offer is shown in <A title="Figure&nbsp;18.11.&nbsp;Effects of new offer" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch18.html#ch18fig11"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 18.11</FONT></A>.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;18.11.&nbsp;Effects of new offer</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>Shareholders in Alpha Inc. would now own 66 percent of the combined company and Beta Inc. shareholders would have the remaining 34 percent. This new split is shown in the upper part of <A title="Figure&nbsp;18.11.&nbsp;Effects of new offer" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch18.html#ch18fig11"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 18.11</FONT></A> and the results for the shareholders in the lower part.</P>
<P>The main changes from the original offer are that Beta shareholders gain over 10 percent in share market values and their dividend losses have been more than wiped out.</P>
<P>Theoretically Alpha shareholders lose something on share price (based on the assumptions we made about the PE ratio). However, Alpha Inc. has gained significantly in terms of EPS and this growth should be reflected in a stronger PE.</P>

We have considered the question: &#8216;How much is Beta Inc. worth in terms of Alpha shares?&#8217;</P>
<P>But we now must try to estimate absolute values for both companies, and to do this we will use an SVA &#8211; discounted cash flow approach. We will come up with estimated future cash flows which we will discount to derive estimates of absolute value for both companies.</P>
<P>The model we will use is basic but very useful. We will use the information we have from the accounts of both companies, and we will make some simplifying assumptions about the future. For instance, we will assume that existing margin on sales and tax percentages will continue at their current levels.</P>
<P>We will use the growth rates that have been indicated for the two companies, i.e. 6 percent for Alpha Inc. and 12 percent for Beta Inc.</P>
<P>We will make one other important assumption, i.e. that both fixed assets and working capital will grow linearly with sales. For example, if sales were to grow by 10 percent then we assume that both groups of assets would grow by the same percentage.</P>
<P>This assumption is probably justified in the case of working capital, because the levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable tend to move closely in line with sales.</P>
<P>However, this is not true for fixed assets. A company that grows significantly over a period will at some time have to increase its fixed asset base, but this investment will probably not take place in small annual increments.

We can say that significant public companies typically have costs of between 7 percent and 9 percent. Beta Inc. is showing a balance sheet that is somewhat weaker than Alpha Inc. Accordingly a WACC at the high end of the range has been estimated for Beta Inc. and at the lower end of the range for Alpha Inc.</P>

<P>We have used the simple annuity formula. We have taken NOPAT (line-4), and added one year&#8217;s growth of 6 percent ($58 + $3.48 = $61.48). We then divide by WACC to get the capitalized value of the company at end of year 10, which sum then forms part of the net cash flow in line-8.</P></DIV></DIV>

<P>But how certain are we that the numbers shown in the accounts do in fact reflect reality and give us a true picture of the state of affairs in the organization concerned? The answer is that in the vast majority of cases we can be certain because of the great scrutiny that these numbers are subject to from the investment community, the banking fraternity and the various regulatory bodies that govern business affairs, for example, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the stock exchange, the accounting institutes, etc. These bodies have derived very detailed regulations governing the presentation of annual accounts and these regulations are constantly being updated to reflect changing circumstances.</P>
<P>Nevertheless because of the diversity of different business situations these regulations cannot be too prescriptive. A certain leeway is still permitted to managers and where companies do not wish to show the true state of affairs, where for various reasons their intent is to present a picture that is more optimistic than justified by the true operating performance, there is still scope for some creative accounting.</P>
<P>Accordingly accounts may be produced where some of the numbers have been manipulated. The purpose of this chapter is to show the more likely areas where such manipulations can occur, and to indicate how some of these may be detected.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt=Introduction src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>Occasionally a company will wish to present accounts that understate performance. This is a much less frequent occurrence and this chapter will concentrate on overstated accounts.</P>
<P>As the subject is constantly evolving, there are still areas in reported accounts where even the most diligent investigator can, at least for a short time, be deceived.</P></DIV>

<P>It is in one or more of these areas that numbers are most likely to be changed in order to give a false picture of the company. So we look to those areas in the financial statements that give information on these three factors, i.e. for profitability we examine the income statement, for a liquidity assessment we look to the balance sheet and cash flow statement and for an evaluation of growth we look to the revenue stream.</P></DIV>
<P>It is useful to remember at this stage that if a number anywhere in the accounts is altered or exaggerated then there has to be a balancing change somewhere else in the accounts. For instance if we show an exaggerated profit in the income statement the amount of the exaggeration will appear either as an enhanced asset or reduced liability in the balance sheet. We can therefore always look for a possible manipulation in two separate sections of the accounts.</P>
<P>The &#8216;notes to accounts&#8217; that always accompany the published statements are a very fertile source of information even if they are often written in tedious and obscure language. Nevertheless they must be read most diligently because each phrase is carefully constructed and designed to portray the information that regulations demand and often not one whit more than that information.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>Of particular interest should be the note on &#8216;accounting policies&#8217;. This is where many of the principles governing the accounts in question are specifically identified. A change in one of the policies, for example, depreciation policy, could be a strong warning signal and pointer towards the need for further investigation.</P>
<P>The next most fertile area of investigation lies with the various ratios that have been detailed in the early chapters in this publication.</P></DIV>

It is distinguished from non-operating revenue, for example, the once-off sale of a fixed asset that, because of its non-recurring nature, would not be considered to be an indicator of current or future business performance. We use the same distinction in relation to operating and non-operating income and operating and non-operating cost.</P>

<P>Operating revenue and its rate of growth are perhaps the two most important key variables to be considered in evaluating overall corporate financial performance. It is in the area of operating revenue taken from the profit and loss account and often referred to as the &#8216;top line&#8217;, that approximately two-thirds of all attempts to enhance a company&#8217;s performance are made.</P></DIV>

<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec1></A>Revenue recognition</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Therefore it is important to consider when revenue can be recognized in the books of account. The rules are very precise.</P>
<DIV class=blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE class=blockquote>
<P>Revenue is earned when a product or service is fully delivered<A id=ch19fn02 class=footnote href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch19.html#ftn.ch19fn02"><SUP class=footnote><FONT color=#0066cc>[*]</FONT></SUP></A> by arrangement to a customer at an agreed price and the customer unconditionally accepts the corresponding financial liability and will probably be able to meet this liability.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV>
<P>The most powerful way to affect disclosed profitability is to alter the figure for operating revenue. There are three ways in which this can be achieved, as shown overleaf.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Revenue recognition" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/tickmark.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>We can distinguish three methods by which operating revenue can be artificially inflated:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>By incorrectly moving revenue from one time period into another. This generally involves bringing revenue which should properly be shown in a future time period back to the current period &#8211; <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>premature revenue</STRONG></SPAN>.</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>By recording sales which do not exist &#8211; <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>fictitious revenue</STRONG></SPAN>.</P>

<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A id=ch19lev3sec1></A>Method 1 &#8211; backdating</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>The simplest way to move revenue into a current period from the succeeding one is simply to alter the cut-off date or backdate invoices and/or delivery notes. This may even involve changing the date in the computer. This, of course, has a very-short-term effect and if enhancement of revenue is required over a number of time periods the effect is cumulative and likely to become visible within a short time.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A id=ch19lev3sec2></A>Method 2 &#8211; stuffed revenue</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Sometimes a company will generate increased revenue for a period by offering customers special inducements, for example, major discounts or bonuses, to take product before they require it and in excess of any sales forecasts. This is called &#8216;stuffing the channel&#8217;. These sales appear to be genuine but they are not appropriate for the current time period. They give a false picture of company performance, they result in lower margins in the current period and much lower revenue in future periods.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A id=ch19lev3sec3></A>Method 3 &#8211; revenue invoiced but not shipped</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>

A company may invoice goods in one quarter when in fact these goods will not be shipped until the following quarter.</P>
<DIV class=sidebar><A id=ch19sb03></A>
<DIV class=titlepage>

<P class=title><STRONG></STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/questionmark.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>One such arrangement is referred to as a <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>bill and hold</STRONG></SPAN> transaction. In this the customer accepts an invoice for goods that have not been delivered, but are held in the supplier&#8217;s warehouse. This can be considered as a genuine sale only if there is a good business reason for the non-delivery and if ownership passes irrevocably to the customer. Furthermore, there must be an irrefutable commitment on the customer&#8217;s part to accept delivery and pay in due course. It is often true that these conditions do not exist and this revenue should not be recognized in the current period.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A id=ch19lev3sec4></A>Method 4 &#8211; revenue for goods shipped but not ordered</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Companies have been known to ship and invoice goods prior to a customer order. Again as no arrangement for this transaction exists with the customer this is not valid revenue. This practice is more common where an agent or dealer rather than a final customer is involved.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A id=ch19lev3sec5></A>Method 5 &#8211; revenue for long-term contracts</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Sometimes a supplier will receive cash up front for a contract that extends over a number of time periods. An example of this would be the sale of a five-year software licence or long-term lease of capital equipment. The supplier may or may not have continuing obligations relating to the contract. Either way the total initial cash receipt cannot be considered as revenue in the current period but in practice it may well be.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A id=ch19lev3sec6></A>Method 6 &#8211; consignment and instalment sales</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>These terms refer to types of sales agreements where the sale is not complete until the product is sold on to the ultimate customer. Such sales should not be recognized as revenue.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

Here sales are recorded that have no economic substance whatever and there is little or no hope that they will ever be converted into cash. Some of the more common ways of doing this are listed below.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec3></A>Method 1 &#8211; Side-letter</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>This is where a product is delivered, invoiced and accepted by the customer, but the customer is given a side-letter that gives him or her certain guarantees, such as full rights to return the goods.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec4></A>Method 2 &#8211; Contra agreement</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Sometimes a sale will be made that is offset by a contra purchase transaction such as, &#8216;If you buy my software I will take your hardware in return&#8217;.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec5></A>Method 3 &#8211; Conditional sale</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Here the customer will not be obliged to pay for goods unless some later condition is fulfilled, for example, no liability for payment unless the goods are ultimately sold or payment is conditional on funds being obtained from a third party.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec6></A>Method 4 &#8211; Vendor funds sale</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>In this case the vendor actually provides the funds to the customer to make the purchase.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec7></A>Method 5 &#8211; Purchaser unlikely to pay</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>This is where goods are invoiced to a customer who is not likely ever to be able to pay for them.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec8></A>Method 6 &#8211; Sales to associated companies</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Where the vendor company is closely related to or actually controls the purchasing company, sales between these are highly suspect.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec9></A>Method 7 &#8211; Pure bogus sales</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec10></A>Revenue recognition policies</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>At the start of this chapter we drew attention to the explanatory notes that accompany published annual accounts and drew particular emphasis to the &#8216;accounting policies&#8217; section. This will contain a statement setting out the company&#8217;s revenue recognition policy. A very careful reading will often identify anomalies.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Revenue recognition policies" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>An example from BMC Software&#8217;s annual report reads: Revenue from the licensing of software is recognised upon the receipt and acceptance of a signed contract or order.</P>

<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/exclamation.jpg" width=37></DIV>
<P>Note the unusual feature here that the product does not have to be delivered and accepted by the customer. In examining the revenue recognition policy take particular note of any comments on how part deliveries, discounts, bonuses, returns, consignment sales, etc. are accounted for. With a little experience the investigator will become familiar with the terminology used in this regard.</P></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec11></A>Accounts receivable days</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Enhanced or fictitious revenue will not generate cash and will therefore appear in the balance as accounts receivable. A surge in the value of accounts receivable or an unusual increase in account receivable days may indicate that something is amiss. An unusual increase in long-term accounts receivable would be even more significant. This could indicate that revenue is being currently recognized for cash flows that are more than one year away.</P></DIV>

<P>Sometimes a very blatant example of revenue enhancement can be detected simply by considering whether a commercial organization has the physical capacity in terms of plant and other assets to produce such a sales outcome. The sales to total assets or sales to fixed assets ratios compared to those of similar companies may throw light on this question.</P></DIV>

When these growth rates deviate significantly for an extended period a close investigation is called for to establish the cause.

<H1 class=title><A id=ch19lev1sec6></A>Operating cost</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Following on from revenue the next most fruitful area of investigation exists in the operating cost section of the profit and loss account. Despite the multitude of rules governing the presentation of accounts there are still quite a number of items where it is accepted that nobody from outside the company can give better answers to certain questions than the existing management. For this reason management has considerable discretion in deciding on some of the values that will be used in the financial accounts, for example:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P><STRONG><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Inventory &#8211;</STRONG></SPAN>.&nbsp;</STRONG>Will it in due course be used or sold on at full value?</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P><STRONG><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Fixed assets &#8211;</STRONG></SPAN>.&nbsp;</STRONG>What are the expected useful lives and what residual values will remain at the end of those lives?</P></LI></UL></DIV>

<P>We will look at the following areas where the accounts are particularly vulnerable:</P>

<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Depreciation</STRONG></SPAN> is a true cost over the life of an asset but in any particular time period the incidence of that cost is only an estimate. It is calculated by making forecasts of the number of years of future life and the residual values of fixed plant. <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Amortization</STRONG></SPAN> is similar to depreciation but it refers to intangible assets. It is even more difficult to quantify.</P></DIV>
<P>No specific guidance is given by the regulatory authorities as to the appropriate period over which fixed assets should be depreciated and companies vary widely in the approach they take. Even companies with similar types of plant and equipment show a great variation in the expected asset lives they report in the accounts, and of course the longer the anticipated lives assigned to plant, the lower the annual cost and the higher the reported profit.</P>
<P><A id=iddle1016 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1052 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1072 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1460 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1610 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1700 class=indexterm></A>Management, by taking either a conservative or aggressive approach to the charge for depreciation, can considerably influence the profitability statement. In this case however the reader has quite an amount of information available to help towards a reasonable assessment.</P>
<P>The notes section of the accounts will have a policy statement concerning the depreciation policy being pursued. Also, in a separate section of the notes to accounts, a considerable breakdown is given of the main categories of fixed assets and the corresponding depreciation amounts. One can use this information to compare the differing approaches of different companies and to take a common sense view of the adequacy of the depreciation charges.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>In particular one should pay very close attention to any indication of a change in depreciation policy or its implementation as this has been a method used historically to hide poor financial results.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec15></A>Capitalized costs</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Whenever a company makes a cash payment or incurs a liability a corresponding entry must be made in either the profit and loss account or the balance sheet.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Capitalized costs" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>For example, $100,000 paid out in operating wages will be reflected in the profit and loss account, whereas the same sum laid out to acquire a piece of equipment will be reflected in the balance sheet.</P>
<P>Every cost ends up either in the profit and loss account or the balance sheet. One way a company can show improved profitability is by moving cost out of the profit and loss account onto the balance sheet. We refer to this as <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>excessive capitalization</STRONG></SPAN>.</P>
<P>When can a cost be capitalized? The &#8216;matching principle&#8217; applies. A cost is correctly charged into the time period in which the corresponding benefit is received. Where the benefits from expenditure will occur in a future rather than in the current time period the cost can be carried forward in the balance sheet to the relevant period, i.e. it can be capitalized.</P>
<P>When inventory is purchased it goes first into the balance sheet and it is transferred to the profit and loss account only when the inventory is incorporated in goods sold. Likewise the purchase of a piece of equipment is first charged to the balance sheet and this initial cost is then transferred to the profit and loss account through the depreciation charge over the life of the asset.</P>
<DIV class=sidebar><A id=ch19sb07></A>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<P class=title><STRONG></STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/exclamation.jpg" width=37></DIV>
<P>A second principle must also be kept in mind here. A company can recognize an item as an asset only if it believes that it will bring some future benefit to the company. These two governing principles should ensure that items can be correctly classified into either the profit and loss account or balance sheet. However areas of difficulty still remain.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>

These millions of dollars spent up front, if treated as a purely operational cost, will have a devastating effect on the operating results for the current period. Management may argue that these heavy initial expenses will bring benefits over many future years and should therefore be capitalized, i.e. shown as an asset on the balance sheet.</P>
<P>Similar arguments can be used in relation to the heavy costs of recruiting subscribers to a service or members to a club. However, one cannot be certain of these future benefits, a considerable amount of judgement is involved as different companies take different approaches.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>Conservative companies will write off many costs to the profit and loss account that an aggressive company will capitalize to the balance sheet. Therefore, one needs to pay great attention to the capitalization policy as stated in the notes to accounts.</P></DIV>

<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec16></A>Use of reserves</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Companies create many kinds of reserves in order to cushion themselves against possible future losses. One obvious example is the reserve for doubtful debts which is offset against accounts receivable. Other common reserves are the inventory obsolescence reserve and the deferred tax reserve.</P>
<P>To create a new reserve or increase an existing reserve we make a charge to the profit and loss account. When a reserve is reduced we reverse that charge and credit the profit and loss account.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Use of reserves" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>By their very nature, reserves are only estimates and management has a lot of flexibility in deciding what reserves are appropriate and what the periodic charge to the profit and loss account should be. This is therefore an area where opportunity exists for some manipulation of the numbers and it merits particularly close attention.</P>
<P>The final balances in the reserve accounts and all movements in and out of reserves must be examined carefully. Particular attention must be paid when a reduction in a reserve is reported. Such a reduction can be used to boost reported profits.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Use of reserves" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>We can ask basic commonsense questions about the adequacy of reserves, for example, is the reserve for bad or doubtful debts increasing in line with accounts receivable? Why has the deferred tax reserve shown a major reduction.</P>
<P>One variant of the reserve manipulation technique is known as the &#8216;big bath&#8217;. A company going through a difficult period may decide to take a very heavy restructuring charge in the current period to provide for <A id=iddle1010 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1269 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1417 class=indexterm></A>future losses related to the closure of plants, redundancy of workers, disposal of bad inventories, etc. This charge will be viewed as a once-off non-recurring cost to the company. It will show up as a restructuring reserve in the balance sheet.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Use of reserves" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>Then in subsequent periods very heavy operating costs can be charged against this reserve and removed from the profit and loss account. The result can be an apparently much improved profit performance which may not be genuine. The time to be especially vigilant against the possibility of this occurring is when a new CEO has been appointed or after a major acquisition.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H1 class=title><A id=ch19lev1sec7></A>The balance sheet</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Sometimes an examination of various asset and liability amounts in the balance sheet will show up an earnings enhancement ploy that would not necessarily be evident in the profit and loss account.</P>
<P>If earnings have been enhanced artificially then the value of an asset will be overstated or a liability undervalued.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="The balance sheet" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/tickmark.jpg" width=30></DIV>

<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec17></A>Overvalued assets &#8211; accounts receivable</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Revenue that is boosted artificially through the recording of either premature or fictitious revenue will cause a corresponding increase in accounts receivable. Accordingly any unexplained surge in this account would call for investigation.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Overvalued assets &#8211; accounts receivable" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>One way to identify an abnormal increase in accounts receivable is to plot the percentage change in sales over a period against the percentage change in accounts receivable. A wide variation in the latter compared to the former would be a cause for alarm. A second way is to extract the &#8216;accounts receivable days&#8217; ratio. Both will show similar trends and pinpoint a possible difficulty.</P></DIV>

<DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec18></A>Overvalued assets &#8211; inventory</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Probably the most common method of increasing declared profit is simply to overvalue closing inventory. This can be achieved by overstating the <A id=iddle1106 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1481 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1590 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1614 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1727 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1730 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1836 class=indexterm></A>physical count, by putting excess value on individual items or by failing to write off stock shrinkages or obsolescence.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Overvalued assets &#8211; inventory" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>To investigate whether this has occurred we can track unusual movements in inventory using methods similar to those outlined under accounts receivable above, i.e. plot percentage change in inventory over time against percentage change in sales. Also extract the &#8216;inventory days&#8217; ratio.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Overvalued assets &#8211; inventory" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>Note that overvaluation of inventory has the further effect in that it will enhance the gross profit to sales percentage. Therefore an unexplained or abnormal increase in inventory combined with a similarly unexplained increase in the gross profit margin would be a major cause for concern.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec19></A>Overvalued assets &#8211; prepayments</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>The prepayments account identifies expenses that have been paid out in the current period but which are properly chargeable in the subsequent period, for example, insurance premiums paid in advance.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Overvalued assets &#8211; prepayments" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>The effect of stating that an item of expense is a prepayment is to remove the cost from the current profit and loss account into the subsequent one and thereby increase the reported profit for the current period. A company that is experiencing problems with its operating results may be tempted to conceal these problems for a short while by artificially creating prepayment amounts.</P></DIV>

<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Accruals</STRONG></SPAN> are liabilities for which invoices have not been received and processed through accounts payable. Examples are unpaid wages, employee vacation expenses and any services or products from an outside source for which invoices have not been received. Also warranty liabilities, where relevant, could be a major element in the accruals account.</P></DIV>
<P><A id=iddle1141 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1286 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1316 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1317 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1329 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1332 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1444 class=indexterm></A>If accruals are understated in a period then profits are correspondingly overstated. One would expect the trend in the value of this account to reflect the trend in sales over time. Over the short term there could be a good business case for divergence but in the longer term the total accruals in the balance sheet should track reasonably well with sales.</P>
<P>One effect of an understatement of this account could be an apparent reduction in administration and selling overhead in the profit and loss account. Therefore if these overhead costs showed a percentage decrease relative to sales at the same time that accruals showed an unusual decrease further investigation would be called for.</P></DIV>

<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec21></A>Undervalued liabilities &#8211; accounts payable</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>The principal debits to accounts payable relate to inventory purchases from suppliers. It has been known to happen in companies that invoices received late in the period have been ignored. This would result in an undervalued accounts payable amount. The effect of undervaluation is that the cost of goods sold will also be understated resulting in an increase in gross margin.</P>
<P>As with other short-term liabilities in the balance sheet, the total value in accounts payable could be expected to move roughly in line with sales. The checks that can be carried out are similar to those mentioned in respect of accounts receivable, i.e. accounts payable days and percentage change relative to percentage growth in sales.</P>

<P>The areas of investigation listed above affect both the profit and loss account and the balance sheet. However, there are certain issues that affect the balance sheet only. These relate mainly to the question of liquidity or balance sheet strength.</P>
<P>In <A title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Financial strength" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch10.html"><FONT color=#0066cc>chapter 10</FONT></A> the importance of the amount of debt relative to the amount of equity in the balance sheet was emphasized.

<P><SPAN class=italic>Accordingly, management in highly borrowed companies have an incentive to reduce the apparent amount of debt in the balance sheet. We could have some &#8216;off balance sheet&#8217; financing.</SPAN></P>

<P>Two ways this can be achieved are through:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>certain kinds of leases &#8211;operating leases and capital leases</P>
<LI class=listitem>

<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A id=ch19lev3sec7></A>Operating leases</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>When a company leases or hires a substantial piece of equipment for a limited period to carry out a particular operation (e.g. a heavy duty transporter to help with the sale and delivery of a unit of product), this is called an operating lease. Ownership of the leased item is not passed to the lessee and the lease cost is a proper charge against the profit and loss account.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A id=ch19lev3sec8></A>Capital leases</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>However, the company may decide that it will have a continued need for this equipment and accordingly it decides to lease it for five years at a total cost over that period that is almost equal to the full purchase price of the equipment. Furthermore, the company may have an agreement with the supplier that at the end of the lease period it will have the right to purchase the equipment at a fixed price.</P>
<DIV class=sidebar><A id=ch19sb10></A>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<P class=title><STRONG></STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/questionmark.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>In this situation what we have is in fact not a lease but a purchase of the equipment, and this purchase is in fact funded by the supplier. This is called a <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>capital lease</STRONG></SPAN>.</P></DIV>
<P>Even though in strictly legal terms ownership of the leased item is not transferred to the lessee, all the risks and the rights of ownership are transferred. Both the asset and the corresponding loan must be recognized in the balance sheet.</P>
<P>Declaring a transaction to be capital lease therefore has the effect of bringing onto the balance sheet additional borrowing related to the cost of the equipment.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>If a company is concerned about its overall debt situation it will be in the interest of management to so arrange matters that a lease that is really of a capital nature is classified as an operating lease.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section>

<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A id=ch19lev3sec9></A>Special purpose entity (SPE)</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>A special purpose entity is, as the title implies, an organizational entity, usually structured as a partnership, set up for some particular purpose such as ownership of a property. Usually there are very good business and financial reasons for using this instrument.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Special purpose entity (SPE)" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>For example, it could be advantageous for a company to have its property assets owned by an SPE. With various safeguards put in place the SPE could be construed to fall into a category of very low risk and it would be able to obtain borrowed money at a very good rate.</P>
<P><A id=iddle1158 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1166 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1307 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1607 class=indexterm></A>Furthermore, by observing the many regulations that govern the structure of SPEs the company can ensure that the accounts of the SPE are not consolidated into the company&#8217;s own published accounts. In this manner both the asset in question, i.e. the property, and the amount of borrowing against that property will appear in the balance sheet of the SPE and not in that of the parent company. Provided that the whole transaction is transparent and is disclosed fully in the notes to the published accounts it would simply be considered a good financial structure.</P>
<P>However the whole subject of SPEs achieved notoriety during the investigation of the financial affairs of ENRON. There were up to 400 separate SPEs related to these accounts. Their purpose, justification and control was non-transparent and indeed was extraordinarily complex. Through them they succeeded in hiding the true state of the company&#8217;s affairs from many skilled and experienced investors.<A id=ch19fn03 class=footnote href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch19.html#ftn.ch19fn03"><SUP class=footnote><FONT color=#0066cc>[*]</FONT></SUP></A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<P><A id=iddle1835 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1868 class=indexterm></A>In comparison with the profit and loss statement and the balance sheet practically no latitude exists in the production of the cash flow statement. Simply stated: when money is received by a company it is a cash in-flow, when a payment is made it is a cash out-flow. For this reason many analysts give greater weight to it than to the profit and loss account. They believe that it gives a more accurate reflection of the true state of the company affairs than either of the other two statements.</P>

<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Cash flow categories &#8211; see figure 19.1" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>We remind ourselves that this term represents the cash flow that arises solely from the trading account. Furthermore when non-recurring items are removed it is considered to be the cash flow from trading that is sustainable into the future.</P>
<P>However there are other flows generated by the operations of the company that are not identified at EBITDA level. First the working capital needs (accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory) of the business must be provided for. Then we remove interest and tax payments, to arrive at CFFO.</P></DIV>

<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec24></A>Cash flow from operations (CFFO)</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>This is a very important number and it is one that features prominently in many analysts&#8217; reports. (Also referred to as &#8216;operating cash flow&#8217;.)</P>

<P>It is crucial because it is a renewable source of cash. Under normal circumstances it will repeat itself year after year and can be expected to grow over time. Furthermore, it represents cash that can be used largely at management&#8217;s discretion. Investment in new plant would be one possible use of these funds; repayment of loans would be another.</P></DIV>

<P>To repeat: cash flow from operations is a truly significant number. If we can imagine the company&#8217;s production and selling operations as an electric generator, the cash flow from operations is the electrical power output from this generator that is both continuous and sustainable. The other forms of cash flow, i.e. investing and funding, do not have these powerful characteristics. Much of a company&#8217;s value therefore lies in the strength of its CFFO.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H2 class=title><A id=ch19lev2sec25></A>CFFO versus net income</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>We would expect over time to see a relationship between CFFO and net earnings. They should show similar rates of growth over time. If this relationship is solid it tends to be a sign of good health. However, if a significant divergence emerged between the trends in these two variables it could indicate that the reporting of earnings is being artificially inflated, that aggressive accounting measures are being used to cover up fundamental problems.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="CFFO versus net income" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>One way to inflate earnings is to create premature or fictitious revenue. However, neither of these kinds of revenue generate any extra cash. Therefore even though a company can report extra revenue it cannot report extra cash in-flow.</P>
<P>Similarly when a company indulges in aggressive cost capitalization it moves items of expense from the profit and loss account onto the balance sheet, thereby reporting extra profit. Cash however has been paid out in respect of these expenses and whereas moving the expense to the balance sheet will result in increased profit it will not result in increased cash flow. Likewise we can boost declared profit by reducing a reserve account, but this again will not boost cash flow, and so on.</P>

<P>In the figure for CFFO therefore we have a further tool to test the integrity of financial accounts.</P></DIV></DIV>
