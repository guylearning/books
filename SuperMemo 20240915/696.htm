<P>Passively processed ideas in the form of sentences rarely leave a durable trace in your memory even if they are reviewed regularly. Very often, as soon as after 2-3 months, you will notice that at review time, you actually do not seem able to recall that you have ever had a given sentence in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="877" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection">collection</A>. You will quickly discover that you need <B>active recall</B> in order to remember. Active recall is a process in which you must answer questions. For example, you may be presented with a picture of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_darwin">Charles Darwin</A> and be asked to recognize his face. In the long run, you need to replace <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Passive_review" data-hasqtip="878" oldtitle="Glossary:Passive review">passive review</A> with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Active_recall" data-hasqtip="879" oldtitle="Glossary:Active recall">active recall</A>. Otherwise, your memory of the fact will not be permanently consolidated. </P>
<P>The fastest way of converting simple sentences into <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Active_recall" data-hasqtip="880" oldtitle="Glossary:Active recall">active recall</A> material is to use a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="881" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletion</A>. Using <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="882" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletion</A>, you work with simple declarative sentences like: </P>

<P>Antioxidants may slow aging process, study says April 5, 1999 Web posted at: 9:39 p.m. EDT (0139 GMT) From Correspondent Linda Ciampa -- Research at Tufts University indicates that a healthy diet fortified with certain fruits and vegetables may slow down and even reverse the aging process. Foods rich in antioxidants -- such as blueberries, strawberries, spinach and broccoli -- have what doctors call high ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity) levels. Middle-aged rats who were fed a high ORAC diet in the USDA-sponsored study experienced less memory loss than those given a normal diet. Some of the older, slower rats became as lively as their younger peers after taking antioxidants. "We prevented both some brain and some behavioral changes that one normally sees in these rats when they hit 15 months of age," said USDA researcher Jim Joseph. Antioxidants are effective in destroying free radicals -- cell-damaging compounds that can help cause cancer and heart disease and speed the aging process. "It's pretty well accepted that aging is due to the production of free radicals. So anything we can do nutritionally to provide additional antioxidants is likely to protect us in the process of aging," Joseph said. That fact already has prompted many to eat a diet rich in antioxidants. "I look at it as sort of a savings account. I'm benefiting today from eating right, but I'm also going to have it in the future," said 30-year-old Cori Alcock. "As I age and grow older, I'll have good health as well." </P>

<P>Once you extract important fragments from an article, you may need to reformulate individual fragments to make sure they are fully context independent, free of redundant information, easy to read, and formulated in such a way that the beginning of the fragment serves as the introduction to the latter phrases and not vice versa. Please have a look at the <A href="#Extracting_the_essence_from_the_article">example from the healthy diet article</A>. We selected four important fragments and these fragments (presented on the left in the table) were reformulated to become fully-independent pieces of information (on the right).

<P>For example, the following texts puzzled a user as it appeared to be hard to process incrementally: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease, even after being passed through a porcelain filter known to retain all bacteria, contained an agent that could infect other tobacco plants.</I></P>
<P><I>In 1900 a similarly filterable agent was reported for foot-and-mouth disease of cattle.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Before you begin learning, you can save lots of time by looking for articles that are properly structured and written in a concise language that will help you save lots of time. For example, <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> is an excellent source. As it is edited by many people in an incremental manner, it is highly context-independent. In comparison, <A class="external text" href="http://britannica.com">Britannica</A> is wordy, full of pronouns, definite clauses, and various context references. </P>
<P>Where <A class="external text" href="http://britannica.com">Britannica</A> might say (fictitious example): "<I>Over the next five years, he struggled to obtain a patent for his invention</I>", <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> might say explicitly "<I>In the years 1883-1889, Edison struggled to obtain a patent for a filament of carbon of high resistance</I>". This context-independent style can save you hours of parsing and re-editing. </P>
<P>In the presented example, the first sentence is causing trouble because the author tried to tell you far more than you might wish to process in one go. </P>
<P>One strategy is to start with monster <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="915" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">clozes</A>, and simplify them incrementally while learning. However, you could save lots of time with another strategy, in which you split the sentences into more manageable portions. Unfortunately, in this case, some editing will be necessary in the beginning. You will also need to carefully parse the meaning of the passage. You could, for example, separate <I>who</I> and <I>what</I> components of the sentence </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>who</B>: In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent smaller than bacteria.</P>

<OL>
<LI>Imagine that you find an article on the net, e.g. <I>The criticism of global capitalism</I>, and you decide to read it and remember it for ever 
<LI>You import the article to SuperMemo 
<LI>You read the article (e.g. once its turn comes up in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="926" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>) 
<LI>While reading, you extract most important paragraphs. One of these, let us say, refers to <I><A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve">Kuznets hypothesis</A></I> 
<LI>The extracted paragraphs will live separate lives in SuperMemo and will be scheduled for separate review, i.e. independent of the review of the parent article. The extracted paragraphs in the parent article will be marked as <SPAN class=extract>processed</SPAN>. Once all paragraphs in the parent article are processed, you will terminate the review of the parent article and keep on reviewing only its components (e.g. selected paragraphs) 
<LI>Upon the first review, usually after a few days, you read the extracted paragraph again and analyze it as to how it should be processed further. You may decide to <A title=Postpone href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Postpone">postpone</A> it, remove it from the learning process, shorten it or extract the most important sentences that you want to remember 
<LI>If you decide to extract a single statement in reference to <I>Kuznets hypothesis</I> it will again be marked as <SPAN class=extract>processed</SPAN> in the original <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="927" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extract</A> and will assume a separate review cycle in SuperMemo 
<LI>Upon the first review of the extracted sentence, you make further decisions as to its further life in SuperMemo. Let us say, this is the wording of the Kuznets sentence: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Acc to Kuznets hypothesis, growth (from the low income levels associated with predominantly agrarian societies) would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>In order to capture the essence, you would probably decide to shorten the above sentence to the following form: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Acc to Kuznets hypothesis, growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>At the same time, other parts of the same parent article might establish a memory trace that would say that <I>Kuznets hypothesis</I> has been based on relatively weak empirical data. Moreover, recent research clearly indicates that the hypothesis is false (growth actually seems to equally benefit both the poor and the rich). You could then enhance the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="928" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract">extract</A> with words <I>controversial</I> or even <I>recently falsified</I>. For example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Recently falsified Kuznets hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Upon the next review of the same sentence, you may decide to convert it into a number of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="929" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletions</A>. This conversion will be incremental, i.e. you may decide to first create a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="930" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletion</A> asking about the name of the controversial hypothesis and only later ask about its actual meaning (the meaning is relatively easier to remember and shall survive longer in your memory without <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Active_recall" data-hasqtip="931" oldtitle="Glossary:Active recall">active recall</A>). Your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="932" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletion</A> could then look like this: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question:</B> Recently falsified <SPAN class=cloze>[...](name)</SPAN> hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality<BR><B>Answer</B>: Kuznets </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="933" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletion</A> would again assume a separate life from the original sentence in which the keyword <I>Kuznets</I> will again be marked as <SPAN class=clozed>processed</SPAN>. This is the original Kuznets sentence with one keyword marked as processed: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Recently falsified <SPAN class=clozed>Kuznets</SPAN> hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>The same sentence will generate a few separate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="934" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletions</A> that will be processed independently. Upon the first review of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="935" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletion</A> created in the previous point, you may decide to simplify it in accordance with the <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">rules of formulating knowledge in learning</A>: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question</B>: Recently falsified <SPAN class=cloze>[...](name)</SPAN> hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase in income inequality<BR><B>Answer</B>: Kuznets </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Upon the next review, you can, but you do not have to, convert the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="936" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletion</A> into a standard question-answer <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="937" oldtitle="Glossary:Item">item</A>: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question</B>: What is the name of the hypothesis that falsely claims that income inequality initially increases with growth?<BR><B>Answer</B>: Kuznets hypothesis </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>The above question-answer pair is probably as simple as it can only be. Certainly, it is simple enough to be relatively easy to remember. This <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="938" oldtitle="Glossary:Item">item</A> will be repeated in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="939" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval">intervals</A> determined by SuperMemo. You can decide how well you want to remember it. By default, it will be remembered with 95% probability of recall and require 5-15 repetitions in lifetime. The establishment of durable memory traces in your memory, completes the life cycle of this particular piece of knowledge. The only thing that remains is the memory-sustaining review in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="940" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval">intervals</A> ranging from months to years (as determined by SuperMemo)

<P>It is not unusual to generate a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="944" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze</A> that will keep causing problems. It is not the subject in question, but the complexity of the sentence that seems to send the brain into a panic mode. You may keep re-reading bad <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="945" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">clozes</A> and get the impression that at each re-reading the understanding decreases (instead of growing). </P>
<P>Here is an example of a bad <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="946" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze</A> taken from a real learning process. It caused 5 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Lapse" data-hasqtip="947" oldtitle="Glossary:Lapse">lapses</A> in succession, and needed special treatment to make it palatable and useful. </P>

<P><B>Question</B>: Companies or other groups are issued emission permits and are required to hold an equivalent number of <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> (or <I>credits</I>) which represent the right to emit a specific amount<BR><B>Answer</B>: allowances </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>With some experience, you will quickly notice that the problem resides in the poor quality of the chosen text. Your first red flag should come with "<I>companies or other groups</I>". Unless you are an insider to the subject, you will instantly wonder what "<I>other groups</I>" means. If you look at the essence of your question, you will notice that "<I>other groups</I>" does not add to the core of the question and can easily be skipped. After some analysis, you can make an effort to formulate a straightforward question, however, it is easier and more cost-effective to take an incremental approach (as long as you keep understanding the question, which may not be the case with you). </P>
<P>As soon as you notice that "<I>other groups</I>" are out of place, you can simplify the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="948" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze</A>: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question</B>: Companies are issued emission permits and are required to hold an equivalent number of <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> (or <I>credits</I>) which represent the right to emit a specific amount<BR><B>Answer</B>: allowances </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You may also notice that <I>allowances</I> and <I>credits</I> are synonymous (acc. to that particular question), and you may not need to tax your memory with both terms. You can therefore make the question easier: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question</B>: Companies are issued emission permits and are required to hold an equivalent number of <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> which represent the right to emit a specific amount<BR><B>Answer</B>: allowances/credits </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>During the next repetition you may wish to simplify the question further. You can now start feeling confident that the question will stick to your memory. If that makes you feel better, you will have made a big step towards better recall:</P>
<P class=mw-empty-elt></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question</B>: Companies hold a number of <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> which represent the right to emit a specific amount<BR><B>Answer</B>: allowances/credits (emission permits) </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Some time in the future, you might take yet another incremental step: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question</B>: <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> represent the right to emit a specific amount (by companies)<BR><B>Answer</B>: allowances/credits (emission permits) </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Finally, you may realize that you question is actually a definition of a term (<I>credit/allowance</I>). As such, it does not even need the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="949" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze</A>. You may also notice that the definition misses an important context point. The original question spoke of carbon emissions (which is probably indicated by the <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> references that provide the context of the question). </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question</B>: (What is the name of) the right to emit a specific amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> (by companies)?<BR><B>Answer</B>: (carbon) permits/allowances/credits </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>With the above definition, learning should finally be easy and fun. Remember that it is a frequently used standard to separate synonyms or equivalent answers with a slash ("/"). This means that any answer will do <I>permits</I>, <I>allowances</I>, or <I>credits</I>. You do not need to list them all and you do not need to remember about semi-obvious <I>carbon</I> prefix. </P>
<P>Interestingly, it can easily be found that the text comes from May 7, 2010 version of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>. It was red-flagged with "clarification needed", which instantly tells you that you are not the only one who got an issue with the paragraph. In such cases blame the author and search for better texts. In this particular example, the <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> text was improved just 2 weeks later, and the current version of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> holds a better version (Aug 2013).

<P>Not all texts are suitable or easy to process with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="950" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>.

You may still prefer to read it on paper in a bathtub. Examples of texts that are difficult to process are: flowery materials, materials rich in explanations and metaphors, programming code, case studies, mathematical derivations, experimental research documentation, etc. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="952" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">Incremental reading</A> is easiest for encyclopedic materials. Materials that are not suitable will often include a valuable message; however, you will often be better off by phrasing it on your own and processing your summary with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="953" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>. For example, you would not want to memorize the Linux source code. However, you could find some specific facts or regularities in the code, describe them shortly and then learn the description incrementally (perhaps with snippet code illustrations). </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Example_1:_Texts_that_are_too_general class=mw-headline>Example 1: Texts that are too general</SPAN></H3>
<P>Here is an example paragraph that caused learning problem to a user of SuperMemo: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>A good enterprise architect should enable the right balance between the needs of the organization for an integrated IT strategy, permitting the closest possible synergy across the extended enterprise, and allowing individual business units to innovate safely in their pursuit of competitive advantage.</I> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The user wrote: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>I have no problem understanding this phrase (synergy across business units must be balanced against freedom to innovate within business units), and I constructed two <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="954" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletions</A> from it for either side of the balance, and when presented with either question I can fill in the blanks. Yet, I was in a discussion recently defending a synergy position, not realizing that it might jeopardize innovation, not even realizing I had this SuperMemo question pointing it out to me. In other words, even though I can answer the question in SuperMemo, it is not something that stuck in my memory, i.e. the synergy is not associated with freedom-to-innovate and vice versa (maybe it will after this mail). So, I suspect that I am only able to answer the question based on recognition of the question or some such, and not on recognition of the association. I figure that a better way to associate the two would be to ask something like "what must be balanced against each other" but this question would be so general in nature that it would create serious interference with other questions that deal with other aspects of enterprise architecture that need to be balanced against each other. Or I would have to make it more specific, again risking to give away the answer in the question, which would also not cause the association to form.</I> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Can you identify a problem here? </P>
<P>In similar cases, you need to pause to ponder what kind of questions you want to be able to answer having read the passage. If the questions are too general or too obvious, you just need to trust your own intelligence and creativity to be able to answer them on the basis of your experience and more specific questions in the given area of knowledge. </P>
<P>In this case, keywords such as "synergy" or "innovate" might provide a hazy way to capture the meaning of the passage. However, very general texts are not suitable for treatment with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="955" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletions</A>. You may waste unnecessary time on re-reading the entire passage at question time, or waste time on simplifying the passage to capture the essence. In school jargon, you might call similar passages "waffle". They may carry an important message, they may help the flow of text, they might be explanatory, but they do not yield material suitable for memorization. In the extreme case you can juxtapose Wikipedia-like "IT = Information Technology" with obvious "waffle" that cannot be clozed: <I>We should be nice for other people</I>. </P>
<P>In all sorts of exams, you will always need to tackle lots of "waffle". You will also meet teachers who demand fluent "waffle" performance. However, this is not the type of knowledge that will make you a better expert or a better person. If you meet "waffle", pause to think if there are questions that truly flow from the text, or if the text is too general to be handled with SuperMemo. In your case, you might do better by perhaps adding some meatier passages on enterprise synergy or constraints on innovation or... Actually, you are the best person to find supplementary material that will help you better understand the underlying issues. </P>
<P>If waffle bothers you, try to find a <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> equivalent. Due to the nature of crowdsourcing, <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> lends itself perfectly to incremental processing. Once you get the hang and feel the benefit, you will quickly learn to spot text and passages that are less suitable and provide less benefit when processed with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" data-hasqtip="956" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading">incremental reading</A>. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Example_2:_Unsuitable_text_from_super-memory.com class=mw-headline>Example 2: Unsuitable text from super-memory.com</SPAN></H3>
<P>Here is another example that comes from <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com">super-memory.com</A>. The text itself is not bad, but it resorts to metaphors that should serve as explanations, not as learning material suitable for generating <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" data-hasqtip="957" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion">cloze deletions</A>. </P>

<P><I><B>Intelligence as processing power</B>: the raw nimbleness and agility of the human mind. When you see a smart student quickly learn new things, think logically, solve puzzles and show uncanny wit, you may say: This guy is really intelligent! See how fast his brain reacts! The student has a fast processor installed and his RAM has a lightning access time. He may though still need a couple of years to "build" good software through years of study. IQ tests attempt to measure this sort of intelligence in abstraction of knowledge. The difficulty of improving processing power by training comes for similar reasons as the fact that programming cannot speed up the processor</I> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The above text is metaphorical. It reiterates the same message a few times using different words in an attempt to find a metaphor that will strike a cord with the reader. Consequently, it is enough you extract only the core message. For example: </P>
