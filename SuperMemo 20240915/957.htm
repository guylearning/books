Profit is the lifeblood of every business. If your business isn&#8217;t profitable, you&#8217;re taking business from others and you will eventually fade away. You either have to be profitable or have an endless amount of capital to throw at your business. To keep it simple, when I say <SPAN class=cmitalic>profit</SPAN>, I&#8217;m talking about pretax profit. This is the profit you make after you take all your sales minus all your costs, before you pay taxes.

If you can&#8217;t pay yourself a market-based wage, the first thing to focus on is getting your business profitable. Remember the cow analogy in chapter 1? You can keep your cow healthy and milk it every day, or you can have one big barbecue dinner. Think of the milk as profit. It eventually turns into cash flow, but you have to be profitable first.

Pretax profit is your earnings before taxes. That is the revenue-generating activity that your business produces for your benefit. In most of the businesses I work with, interest, depreciation, and amortization are real numbers, so it&#8217;s important to understand that you should ignore EBITDA and focus on your pretax profit.

As I said in chapter 1, revenue is for show, and profit is for dough. I couldn&#8217;t care less how much revenue you have. It&#8217;s an important number in terms of cash turnover, but we need to focus primarily on your gross profit before we can fix your pretax profit. Gross profit is revenue less cost of goods sold. Contrary to many other accountants, I recommend that you not include any labor costs in getting to gross profit. By keeping labor out of the equation, my definition of gross profit gets you to the number that is the true economic engine of the business.

<P class=indent><A id=page_20>Cost of goods sold typically includes pass-through costs like finished <A id=page_21>goods, materials, and subcontractors. These costs will vary dramatically among businesses and industries. By focusing on gross profit instead of revenue, most businesses from any industry can be compared side to side. For instance, I can take a service-based business and compare it to a retailer, and then I can compare the retailer to a building contractor. I can compare the building contractor to a government contractor because when I sell materials, I&#8217;m really selling the services of the people who deliver the materials. If I have labor that I want to account for as direct labor (that is, labor that is directly responsible for product or service delivery), I show it on a separate line below gross profit. Gross profit minus your direct labor is then what I refer to as your contribution margin before you pay for your general operating expenses. Don&#8217;t think of subcontractors as your labor that you make money from. If I hire a subcontractor, I have to leave profit in the equation for the subcontractor&#8217;s business since I am offloading my downtime risk to the subcontractor. Therefore, I am just passing through some of my revenue to the subcontractor. You can show the world all the expanded financials you want, but you have to come back to reality and filter out the cost of goods sold.</A>
