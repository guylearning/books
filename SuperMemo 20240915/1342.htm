<P class=indent>You have to keep your business going during these times. Your cash reserves will cover it to a point, but this situation can become disruptive in a hurry. This is when you should use your line of credit. You&#8217;re not using a line of credit to fund a losing business. That&#8217;s what your capital reserves are for, should you choose to use them for that purpose. This is a significant distinction. You should rely on debt only in extraordinary circumstances.</P></A>

Do not confuse debt with capital. Capital is the cash you leave in the business to fund your receivables and inventory for normal business conditions, and debt is financing for special cases. Once you start financing normal receivables with debt, you are lowering the odds of your business being able to survive a downturn.
