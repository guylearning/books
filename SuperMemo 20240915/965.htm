<P class=indent>A coach has a set amount of money to spend. He can have a great quarterback, but if he doesn&#8217;t also spend money on a really good left tackle, that quarterback is going to be dead by the third or fourth game of the season. So he has to spend enough money on that left tackle. But wait&#8212;now he has to find somebody for his great quarterback to throw to. And he needs a running back to hand the ball to. What about the defense? It has to play well enough to stop the other team. See how interconnected these decisions are?</P>
<P class=indent>While looking at some news reports on the Patriots, I found a really interesting example that highlights my point. Back in 2003, the Patriots had Lawyer Milloy, a free safety who was holding out for a new contract. Milloy had a great career with the Patriots. His agent was asking for a contract worth about $4 million, which at the time was the market value of someone with Malloy&#8217;s skill set. Instead of extending his contract, the Patriots decided to cut him. Milloy&#8217;s market value wasn&#8217;t disputed in the marketplace. He got picked up by the Buffalo Bills at that price. That year the Patriots drafted a rookie, Eugene Wilson, and paid him the league minimum: $400,000 for four years. Essentially, the Patriots swapped a known commodity (Milloy, who was a Pro Bowl safety) for a rookie they thought they could develop into an effective player. Wilson didn&#8217;t start the first game, but he did play during the first game. After that, Wilson started every game for the next four years. The first year that Wilson was the Patriots&#8217; free safety, they won the Super Bowl. At the end of Wilson&#8217;s contract, he was a free agent and the Patriots didn&#8217;t re-sign him.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_40><A id=page_41>The Patriots pride themselves on their ability to maximize output for every dollar they spend on labor. Their success is based on knowing when to hire veteran talent and when to develop new talent. They have been effective at both. I stress the story of developing talent here because most entrepreneurs want quick success and resist training as a viable option for growth.</A>
