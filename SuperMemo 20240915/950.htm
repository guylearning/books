But for now, it&#8217;s important to understand that if you are underpaying yourself, your business is sick. I like to say that a business is like a cow. Until you pay yourself a market-based wage&#8212;and make a profit on top of that&#8212;you have a sick cow on your hands. Your goal is to keep the cow healthy so you can milk it every day. Or you can have one barbecue. Take your pick. In other words, your goal should be to create a business that generates income for you every day rather than killing your business by taking out too much income at one time. But don&#8217;t worry&#8212;I&#8217;ll show you how to keep your business (your cash cow) healthy.
