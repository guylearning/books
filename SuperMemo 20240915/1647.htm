<DIV class=section-content>
<P>Images (and other media asset types) you find on the web are released under various license types. Before you use an image on a site you are building, ensure you own it, have permission to use it, or comply with the owner's licensing conditions.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION aria-labelledby=understanding_license_types>
<H3 id=understanding_license_types><A href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML#understanding_license_types"><FONT color=#0066cc>Understanding license types</FONT></A></H3>
<DIV class=section-content>
<P>Let's look at some common categories of licenses you are likely to find on the web.</P>
<H4 id=all_rights_reserved>All rights reserved</H4>
<P>Creators of original work such as songs, books, or software often release their work under closed copyright protection. This means that, by default, they (or their publisher) have exclusive rights to use (for example, display or distribute) their work. If you want to use copyrighted images with an <EM>all rights reserved</EM> license, you need to do one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Obtain explicit, written permission from the copyright holder. 
<LI>Pay a license fee to use them. This can be a one-time fee for unlimited use ("royalty-free"), or it might be "rights-managed", in which case you might have to pay specific fees per use by time slot, geographic region, industry or media type, etc. 
<LI>Limit your uses to those that would be considered <A class=external href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>fair use</FONT></A> or <A class=external href="https://copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p27_work_of_others" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>fair dealing</FONT></A> in your jurisdiction.</LI></UL>
<P>Authors are not required to include a copyright notice or license terms with their work. Copyright exists automatically in an original work of authorship once it is created in a tangible medium. So if you find an image online and there are no copyright notices or license terms, the safest course is to assume it is protected by copyright with all rights reserved.</P>
<H4 id=permissive>Permissive</H4>
<P>If the image is released under a permissive license, such as <A class=external href="https://mit-license.org/" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>MIT</FONT></A>, <A class=external href="https://opensource.org/license/BSD-3-clause" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>BSD</FONT></A>, or a suitable <A class=external href="https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>Creative Commons (CC) license</FONT></A>, you do not need to pay a license fee or seek permission to use it. Still, there are various licensing conditions you will have to fulfill, which vary by license.</P>
<P>For example, you might have to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Provide a link to the original source of the image and credit its creator. 
<LI>Indicate whether any changes were made to it. 
<LI>Share any derivative works created using the image under the same license as the original. 
<LI>Not share any derivative works at all. 
<LI>Not use the image in any commercial work. 
<LI>Include a copy of the license along with any release that uses the image.</LI></UL>
<P>You should consult the applicable license for the specific terms you will need to follow.</P>
<DIV id=sect10 class="notecard note">
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> You may come across the term "copyleft" in the context of permissive licenses. Copyleft licenses (such as the <A class=external href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>GNU General Public License (GPL)</FONT></A> or "Share Alike" Creative Commons licenses) stipulate that derivative works need to be released under the same license as the original.</P></DIV>
<P>Copyleft licenses are prominent in the software world. The basic idea is that a new project built with the code of a copyleft-licensed project (this is known as a "fork" of the original software) will also need to be licensed under the same copyleft license. This ensures that the source code of the new project will also be made available for others to study and modify. Note that, in general, licenses that were drafted for software, such as the GPL, are not considered to be good licenses for non-software works as they were not drafted with non-software works in mind.</P>
<P>Explore the links provided earlier in this section to read about the different license types and the kinds of conditions they specify.</P>
<H4 id=public_domaincc0>Public domain/CC0</H4>
<P>Work released into the public domain is sometimes referred to as "no rights reserved" &#8212; no copyright applies to it, and it can be used without permission and without having to fulfill any licensing conditions. Work can end up in the public domain by various means such as expiration of copyright, or specific waiving of rights.</P>
<P>One of the most effective ways to place work in the public domain is to license it under <A class=external href="https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>CC0</FONT></A>, a specific creative commons license that provides a clear and unambiguous legal tool for this purpose.</P>
<P>When using public domain images, obtain proof that the image is in the public domain and keep the proof for your records. For example, take a screenshot of the original source with the licensing status clearly displayed, and consider adding a page to your website with a list of the images acquired along with their license requirements.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION aria-labelledby=searching_for_permissively-licensed_images>
<H3 id=searching_for_permissively-licensed_images><A href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML#searching_for_permissively-licensed_images"><FONT color=#0066cc>Searching for permissively-licensed images</FONT></A></H3>
<DIV class=section-content>
<P>You can find permissive-licensed images for your projects using an image search engine or directly from image repositories.</P>
<P>Search for images using a description of the image you are seeking along with relevant licensing terms. For example, when searching for "yellow dinosaur" add "public domain images", "public domain image library", "open licensed images", or similar terms to the search query.</P>
<P>Some search engines have tools to help you find images with permissive licenses. For example, when using Google, go to the "Images" tab to search for images, then click "Tools". There is a "Usage Rights" dropdown in the resulting toolbar where you can choose to search specifically for images under creative commons licenses.</P>
<P>Image repository sites, such as <A class=external href="https://flickr.com/" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>Flickr</FONT></A>, <A class=external href="https://www.shutterstock.com/" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>ShutterStock</FONT></A>, and <A class=external href="https://pixabay.com/" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>Pixabay</FONT></A>, have search options to allow you to search just for permissively-licensed images. Some sites exclusively distribute permissively-licensed images and icons, such as <A class=external href="https://picryl.com/" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>Picryl</FONT></A> and <A class=external href="https://thenounproject.com/" target=_blank><FONT color=#0066cc>The Noun Project</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>Complying with the license the image has been released under is a matter of finding the license details, reading the license or instruction page provided by the source, and then following those instructions. Reputable image repositories make their license conditions clear and easy to find.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION aria-labelledby=annotating_images_with_figures_and_figure_captions>

<P>We've seen that static images can be displayed using the <A href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img"><CODE><FONT color=#0066cc>&lt;img&gt;</FONT></CODE></A> element, or by setting the background of HTML elements using the <A href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image"><CODE><FONT color=#0066cc>background-image</FONT></CODE></A> property. You can also construct graphics on-the-fly, or manipulate images after the fact. The browser offers ways of creating 2D and 3D graphics with code, as well as including video from uploaded files or live streamed from a user's camera. Here are links to articles that provide insight into these more advanced graphics topics:</P>

<DT id=svg><A href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG"><FONT color=#0066cc>SVG</FONT></A>
