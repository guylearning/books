In the search for a company with a durable competitive advantage the lower the company&#8217;s SGA expenses, the better. If they can stay consistently low, all the better. In the world of business anything under 30% is considered fantastic. However, there are a number of companies with a durable competitive advantage that have SGA expenses in the 30% to 80% range.

Warren has learned to steer clear of companies cursed with consistently high SGA expenses. He also knows that the economics of companies with low SGA expenses can be destroyed by expensive research and development costs, high capital expenditures, and/or lots of debt. He avoids these kinds of businesses regardless of the price, because he knows that their inherent long-term economics are so poor that even a low asking price for the stock will not save investors from a lifetime of mediocre results.
