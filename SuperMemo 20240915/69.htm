<li>Deferred Income Tax is tax that is due but hasn’t been paid. This figure tells us little about whether or not the company has a durable competitive advantage. (see <a href="#467">below)</a>
<li>The Minority Interest entry on a balance sheet is far more interesting. When the company acquires the stock of another, it books the price it paid for the stock as an asset . (see <a href="#468">below)</a>
<li>“Other Liabilities” is a catchall category into which businesses pool their miscellaneous debt. It includes such liabilities as judgments against the company, non-current . (see <a href="#469">below)</a>

The Minority Interest entry on a balance sheet is far more interesting. When the company acquires the stock of another, <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=121 id=page_121></SPAN>it books the price it paid for the stock as an asset under &#8220;long-term investments.&#8221; But when it acquires more than 80% of the stock of a company, it can shift the acquired company&#8217;s entire balance sheet onto its balance sheet. The same with the income statement. An example: Berkshire&#8217;s acquisition of 90% of the Nebraska Furniture Mart. Because it acquired more than 80% of the NFM, Berkshire could book 100% of NFM&#8217;s income onto Berkshire&#8217;s income statement, and it could add 100% of NFM&#8217;s assets and liabilities to its balance sheet. What the Minority Interest entry represents is the value of the 10% of NFM that Berkshire does not own. This shows up as a liability to balance the equation, since Berkshire booked 100% of NFM&#8217;s assets and liabilities, even though it owns only 90% of NFM. So what does this have to do with identifying a company with a durable competitive advantage? Not much, but it is interesting to know what matters and what doesn&#8217;t in our search for the company with a durable competitive advantage.

&#8220;Other Liabilities&#8221; is a catchall category into which businesses pool their miscellaneous debt. It includes such liabilities as judgments against the company, non-current benefits, interest on tax liabilities, unpaid fines, and derivative instruments. None of these helps us in our search for the durable competitive advantage.
