It is a frequent case that a SuperMemo beginner, amazed with results obtained by a friend who used the method, embarks on an exceedingly ambitious program of gaining new knowledge. The thing (s)he usually overestimates is his or her own learning ability and perseverance. SuperMemo does not guarantee an immediate success. It requires some skills and strategy that develop over a longer period of time. The fact that a student can memorize a myriad of items in a short time does not necessarily mean that the same student will have enough perseverance to continue repetitions of the newly memorized material. Nor does it indicate that the learned items are properly structured and will be kept in memory as easily as they have been memorized.

<OL>
<LI><B>You slow down in the beginning: </B>The speed of learning decreases substantially during the first few months of learning as a result of a pile up of repetitions (the decline is most visible in the first few weeks)
