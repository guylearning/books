A company must maintain sufficient cash resources to pay all legitimate bills as they arise. A company that cannot do so has run out of liquidity and is in a very serious financial condition. Ironically, this is so even if it is currently generating good profits. 
<P>When cash runs out, the company&#8217;s management has lost the power to make independent decisions. An outside agency, such as an unpaid creditor or a bank whose loan is in default, will decide the fate of the company.</P>
<P>That fate could be bankruptcy, a forced reconstruction, an involuntary takeover, or the company could be allowed to continue in some altered form. The reality is that management has lost its authority. It is also likely that the owners have lost their entire investment.

One may well ask, &#8216;How can this happen if profits are good?&#8217; The answer is that it does happen and for reasons that will become clearer later.</P>
<P>Loss of profits is often the immediate cause of the disaster, but as we have said, it can happen even when companies are making good profits. Indeed, profitable and rapidly growing small companies very often run out of cash. They then pass out of the hands of the original owner or entrepreneur who is left with nothing, while others reap the benefits of his enterprise.
