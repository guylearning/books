If you&#8217;re not paying yourself a market-based wage, you really don&#8217;t know what it means from a financial standpoint to bring in another general manager. You&#8217;ll have to pay your replacement a market-based wage, and this will negatively impact your business&#8217;s net income. But if you&#8217;re already paying yourself a market-based wage, it&#8217;s easier to step out of the role of being an active manager and into the role of being only a shareholder. You can hire your replacement with no negative impact on your net income. Not only that, you have a methodology in place that reflects the true profitability of your business.

<P class=indent>Instead of retiring, you might consider a part-time role that pays less than your CEO salary, such as being a finance person or a customer advocate. I recommend easing out slowly, because stepping out of a business abruptly usually creates a vacuum. This approach allows you to effectively transition out of the business in phases. You&#8217;ll also know if your business will produce, for example, $500,000 a year of pretax profit no matter who&#8217;s running it. And if you give your replacement a market-based wage while you stay on in a lesser role, then you can hold that new person accountable.</P>
<P class=indent>You can even set up an incentive program to motivate the new CEO. Tell the new person, &#8220;I&#8217;ll share a percentage of anything you get above my baseline profit number. Your baseline could be what the business was doing before you hired on as the new CEO or it could even be a higher target. But if you don&#8217;t get what I was getting when I was CEO, you&#8217;d better give me a good reason. Is the market causing lower revenue and profitability, or is it because you can&#8217;t make it happen?&#8221;
