In choosing facts and rules to remember, you should primarily use the criterion of applicability. Lots of items may seem worth knowing, but because of the limited capacity of memory, only a small fraction of them may actually be remembered, and the choice should favor items of the highest applicability in day-to-day situations. You will not waste much time if you include items that you would remember anyway just because of their regular use. Therefore, you better always err on the safe side and include all important items you are not sure you would remember.

Concerning the selection of the material to learn, another general principle is that you should first master the most fundamental aspects of the learned subject and get into details at later stages. Meticulous dismembering of textbooks page by page is bound to produce excess of details at the cost of principal knowledge. An important psychological aspect of the general-to-specialized approach is that you can soon discover great profits coming from the perfect knowledge of the most fundamental facts. With amazement, you will notice how new facts and rules excellently slot in in what you have already learned.</P>
<P>Good foundations make it easier to slot in new knowledge, provide additional encouragement to work, and free you from the unhealthy impression that you are acquiring knowledge for the knowledge's sake.
