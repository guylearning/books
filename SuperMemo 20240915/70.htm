<P class=indent>The debt to shareholders&#8217; equity ratio has historically been used to help us identify whether or not a company is using debt to finance its operations or equity (which includes retained earnings). The company with a durable competitive advantage will be using its earning power to finance its operations and therefore, in theory, should show a higher level of shareholders&#8217; equity and a lower level of total liabilities. The company without a competitive advantage will be using debt to finance its operations and, therefore, should show just the opposite, a lower level of shareholders&#8217; equity and a higher level of total liabilities.</P><BR>
<P class=indent>The equation is: Debt to Shareholders&#8217; Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities &#247; Shareholders&#8217; Equity.

The problem with using the debt to equity ratio as an identifier is that the economics of companies with a durable competitive advantage are so great that they don&#8217;t need a large amount of equity/retained earnings on their balance sheets to get the job done; in some cases they don&#8217;t need any. Because of their great earning power they will often spend their built-up equity/retained earnings on buying back their stock, which decreases their equity/retained earnings base. That in turn increases their debt to equity ratio, often to the point that their debt to equity ratio looks like that of a mediocre business&#8212;one without a durable competitive advantage.

It is easy to see the contrast between companies with a durable competitive advantage and those without it when we look at the treasury share-adjusted debt to shareholders&#8217; equity ratio. Durable competitive advantage holder Procter &amp; Gamble has an adjusted ratio of .71; Wrigley, meanwhile, has a ratio of .68&#8212;which means that for every dollar of shareholders&#8217; equity Wrigley has, it also has 68 cents in debt. Contrast P&amp;G and Wrigley with Goodyear Tire, which has an adjusted ratio of 4.35, or Ford, which has an adjusted ratio of 38.0. This means that for every dollar of shareholders&#8217; equity that Ford has, it also has $38 in debt&#8212;which equates to $7.2 billion in shareholders&#8217; equity and $275 billion in debt.

The simple rule here is that, unless we are looking at a financial institution, any time we see an adjusted debt to shareholders&#8217; equity ratio below .80 (the lower the better), there is a good chance that the company in question has the coveted durable competitive advantage we are looking for.
