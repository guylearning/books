As mentioned above, I'm usually doing such reading as part of the background research for some project. I will find a new article (or set of articles), and typically spend a few minutes assessing it. Does the article seem likely to contain substantial insight or provocation relevant to my project &#8211; new questions, new ideas, new methods, new results? If so, I'll have a read. 
<P></P>
<P>This doesn't mean reading every word in the paper. Rather, I'll add to Anki questions about the core claims, core questions, and core ideas of the paper. It's particularly helpful to extract Anki questions from the abstract, introduction, conclusion, figures, and figure captions. Typically I will extract anywhere from 5 to 20 Anki questions from the paper. It's usually a bad idea to extract fewer than 5 questions &#8211; doing so tends to leave the paper as a kind of isolated orphan in my memory. Later I find it difficult to feel much connection to those questions. Put another way: if a paper is so uninteresting that it's not possible to add 5 good questions about it, it's usually better to add no questions at all.

How to avoid Ankifying misleading work? 
<P></P>
<P>As an example, let me describe how I Ankified a paper I recently read, by the economists Benjamin Jones and Bruce Weinberg*<SPAN class=marginnote 72%? LEFT: 148px; WIDTH:>* Benjamin F. Jones and Bruce A. Weinberg, <A href="https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Jones2011a.pdf">Age Dynamics in Scientific Creativity</A>, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2011).</SPAN>. The paper studies the ages at which scientists make their greatest discoveries. </P>
<P>I should say at the outset: I have no reason to think this paper is misleading! But it's also worth being cautious. As an example of that caution, one of the questions I added to Anki was: &#8220;What does Jones 2011 claim is the average age at which physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery, over 1980-2011?&#8221; (Answer: 48). Another variant question was: &#8220;Which paper claimed that physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery at average age 48, over the period 1980-2011?&#8221; (Answer: Jones 2011). And so on. </P>
<P>Such questions qualify the underlying claim: we now know it was a claim made in Jones 2011, and that we're relying on the quality of Jones and Weinberg's data analysis. In fact, I haven't examined that analysis carefully enough to regard it as a fact that the average age of those Nobelists is 48. But it is certainly a fact that their paper claimed it was 48. Those are different things, and the latter is better to Ankify.

<CENTER><img src="https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Jones_figure2011a.png"> </CENTER>
<P>I have an Anki question which simply says: &#8220;Visualize the graph Jones 2011 made of the probability curves for physicists making their prizewinning discoveries by age 30 and 40&#8221;. The answer is the image shown above, and I count myself as successful if my mental image is roughly along those lines. I could deepen my engagement with the graph by adding questions such as: &#8220;In Jones 2011's graph of physics prizewinning discoveries, what is the peak probability of great achievement by age 40 [i.e., the highest point in the blue line in the graph above]?&#8221; (Answer: about 0.8.) Indeed, one could easily add dozens of interesting questions about this graph. I haven't done that, because of the time commitment associated to such questions. But I do find the broad shape of the graph fascinating, and it's also useful to know the graph exists, and where to consult it if I want more details.

I said above that I typically spend 10 to 60 minutes Ankifying a paper, with the duration depending on my judgment of the value I'm getting from the paper. However, if I'm learning a great deal, and finding it interesting, I keep reading and Ankifying. Really good resources are worth investing time in. But most papers don't fit this pattern, and you quickly saturate. If you feel you could easily find something more rewarding to read, switch over. It's worth deliberately practicing such switches, to avoid building a counter-productive habit of completionism in your reading. It's nearly always possible to read deeper into a paper, but that doesn't mean you can't easily be getting more value elsewhere. It's a failure mode to spend too long reading unimportant papers.
