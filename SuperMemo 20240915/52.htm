Current Assets is made up of &#8220;cash and cash equivalents,&#8221; &#8220;short-term investments,&#8221; &#8220;net receivables,&#8221; &#8220;inventory,&#8221; and a general slush fund called &#8220;other assets.&#8221; These are called current assets because they are cash, or they can be or will be converted into cash in a very short period of time (usually within a year). As a rule, they are listed on the balance sheet in order of their liquidity (which means how quickly they can be turned into cash). Historically, current assets have also been called quick, liquid, or floating assets. What is important about them is their availability to be turned into cash and spent should the business economics of the enterprise start to erode and other sources of day-to-day operating capital start to evaporate. (If you can&#8217;t imagine sources of operating capital evaporating overnight, just think Bear Stearns.)
