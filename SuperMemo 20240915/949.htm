<A id=page_10>Because my practice has worked with so many companies in so many industries, we have a pretty good idea of what a CEO should get paid. If you&#8217;re doing $1 million in revenue, it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;ll make $200,000 as the CEO. We typically look at ranges to determine a CEO&#8217;s salary. You probably have one or two people in four or five key functional roles in your business, so you should take a blended approach to setting salary levels. A great example of this is a business where the CEO is also responsible for sales. The CEO function of a business with $1 million of revenue is not a full-time role and accounts for only 20 percent of the owner&#8217;s time. The remainder of the owner&#8217;s time is spent on sales. If the owner takes a salary of $125,000 per year, $25,000 is the CEO salary, and $100,000 is the VP of sales salary. You can see the problem that arises when the CEO decides to hire a VP of sales. The CEO would have to take a salary cut. The solution is that the CEO continues to sell along with the VP of sales, and the business grows faster so it can eventually justify a full-time CEO. In a single-shareholder business, there are times when the shareholder can decide not to take a market-based wage and remain within the IRS guidelines of reasonable pay. But I still believe the profit card should always trump a tax strategy.</A>
