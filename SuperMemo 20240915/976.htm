<P class=noindent>Before you take that money out as a distribution, ask yourself this question: Is there something you can spend $100,000 on for the business that will get you more than $100,000 back? Don&#8217;t even consider spending $100,000 just to save 40 cents on the dollar in taxes. That&#8217;s just a dumb idea.</P>
<P class=indent>If the answer is no, then is there something you should build toward that costs <SPAN class=cmitalic>more</SPAN> than $100,000? Maybe you want to buy a competitor, spin off a new business, or purchase a big piece of equipment that would really change the markets you can get into. Whatever it is, you can keep saving until you hit the number that will help you reach a big goal.

If you’re not saving for a big goal, then take the $100,000 distribution and look at your personal life. Do you have any debt or owe any taxes? If not, then what’s your liquidity target? Most entrepreneurs who have businesses between $1 million and $5 million need to build up about $2 million of liquid, safe, core assets that give them stability no matter what they’re doing in life. When you reach $2 million, you can set your sights even higher. Build a solid foundation first, and then you can enjoy taking some risks.
