<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>S</SPAN>hort-term debt is money that is owed by the corporation and due within the year. This includes commercial paper and short-term bank loans. Short-term money historically has been cheaper than long-term money. This means that it is possible <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=110 id=page_110></SPAN>to make money borrowing short-term and lending it long-term. We borrow short-term money at 5% and lend it long-term for 7%&#8212;sounds easy enough. But the problem with this strategy is that the money we borrowed is short-term money. That means that we have to pay it back within the year, which is easy enough to do&#8212;we just borrow more money short-term to pay back the short-term debt that is coming due. In the financial world, this is called &#8220;rolling over the debt.&#8221; And it all works well until short-term rates jump above what we lent the money long at, which was 7%. Sure, it seemed like a great idea when short-term rates were 5%, but now that they have jumped to 8%, we have to refinance our short-term debt at a rate in excess of what we loaned it out at. And that does not make us happy.</P>
<P class=indent>Another part of the short-term borrowing disaster equation is what happens if we lend all this money long-term, but our creditors decide not to loan us any more money short-term. Suddenly we have to pay back all that money we borrowed short-term and lent long-term. But we don&#8217;t have it, because we lent it long-term, which means that we won&#8217;t get paid back for many, many years.

In troubled financial times it is the stable conservative banks like Wells Fargo that have the competitive advantage over the go-go aggressive banks that have gotten themselves into trouble. The &#8220;durability&#8221; equates with the stability that comes with being conservative. It has money when the others have losses, which creates opportunity. Aggressive borrowers <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=112 id=page_112></SPAN>of short-term money are often at the mercy of sudden shifts in the credit markets, which puts their entire operation at risk and equates with a loss of any kind of durability in their business model. And in the business world durability of a competitive advantage is a lot like virginity&#8212;easier to protect than it is to get back.
