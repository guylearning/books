Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Other Debts can tell us a lot about the current situation of a business, but as stand-alone entries they tell us little about the long-term economic nature of the business and whether or not it has a durable competitive advantage. However, the amount of short- and long-term debt that a company carries can tell a great deal about the long-term economics of a business and whether or not it has a durable competitive advantage.
