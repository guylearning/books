<SPAN class=stickup>O</SPAN>ne of the first things Warren does is to look at the assets to see how much cash and cash equivalents a company has. This asset is exactly what it says it is&#8212;cash&#8212;or it is the equivalent of cash, such as a short-term CD at the bank, <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=78 id=page_78></SPAN>three-month Treasuries, or other highly liquid assets. A high number for cash or cash equivalents tells Warren one of two things&#8212;that a company has a competitive advantage that is generating tons of cash, which is a good thing, or that it has just sold a business or a ton of bonds, which may not be a good thing. A low amount or the lack of a stockpile of cash usually means that the company has poor or mediocre economics.

The money comes in the door, and if it comes in faster than operating costs can spend it, it starts to pile up; as it piles up, the company has to decide what to do with it. Traditionally, companies have used excess cash to expand operations, buy entirely new businesses, invest in partially owned businesses via the stock <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=79 id=page_79></SPAN>market, buy back their shares, or pay out a cash dividend to shareholders. But quite often they simply sock it away for a rainy day. One can never be too financially prepared in our constantly changing and challenging world.

A company basically has three ways of creating a large stockpile of cash. It can sell new bonds or equity to the public, which creates a stockpile of cash before it is put to use. It can also sell an existing business or other assets that the company owns, which can also create a stockpile of cash before the company finds other uses for it. Or it has an ongoing business that generates more cash than the business burns. It is this scenario of a large stockpile of cash created by an ongoing business that really grabs Warren&#8217;s attention. Because a company that has a surplus of cash as the result of ongoing business is often a company that has some kind of durable competitive advantage working in its favor.

So here is the rule: If we see a lot of cash and marketable securities and little or no debt, chances are very good that the business will sail on through the troubled times. But if the company is hurting for cash and is sitting on a mountain of <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=80 id=page_80></SPAN>debt, it probably is a sinking ship that not even the most skilled manager can save.

A simple test to see exactly what is creating all the cash is to look at the past seven years of balance sheets. This will reveal whether the cash hoard was created by a one-time event, such as the sale of new bonds or shares, or the sale of an asset or an existing business, or whether it was created by ongoing business operations. If we see lots of debt, we probably aren&#8217;t dealing with an exceptional business. But if we see a ton of cash piling up and little or no debt, and no sales of new shares or assets, and we also note a history of consistent earnings, we&#8217;re probably seeing an excellent business with the durable competitive advantage that Warren is searching for&#8212;the kind of company that will make us rich over the long-term.
