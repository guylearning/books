<P class=indent>Like most entrepreneurs, they think the solution to the problem of their lack of pretax profit is to grow. They make it all the way up to $4 million in revenue in the next two years. But look at their pretax profit. It didn&#8217;t go up along with the revenue. See where the revenue flattens out in Years 3 and 4? This is where I started working with the clients. I told them we had to fix their profitability before we could fix their lack of cash and their excess debt.</P>
<P class=indent>They made the classic mistake of adding labor to support their growth, but they failed to get enough of an increase in gross profit to drive toward profitability. They had to go back, fix the functional areas that weren&#8217;t working, and look at the business anew. They had inefficient field labor that was taking too long on simple tasks, people on payroll who were not billable, and sales people who were constantly close to, but never above, the sales goal because they were wasting time by chasing the wrong customers.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_36>Company A set out to improve their profitability so the profit curve would mirror the income curve. In addition, they focused on making the slope of the equity curve equal to the slope of the revenue curve. To accomplish this, they drove the revenue back down to $3 million and <A id=page_37>then started working their way back up. They examined unprofitable customers and stopped taking on customers that produced low gross profit. Since their revenue declined, it gave them an opportunity to trim the staff and retain the core employees they felt were keepers.</A></P><A id=page_37>
<P class=indent>Notice in the graph that their equity went up at the same rate as their pretax profit. Even though their revenue increased, they kept their pretax profit in the business and turned it into equity by reinvesting it in the business.</P></A>
