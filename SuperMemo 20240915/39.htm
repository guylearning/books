Gross profit is how much money the company made off of total revenue after subtracting the costs of the raw goods and the labor used to make the goods. It doesn&#8217;t include such categories as sales and administrative costs, depreciation, and the interest costs of running the business.

<P class=indent>The equation for determining gross profit margin is:</P>
<P class=centerx>Gross Profit &#247; Total Revenues = Gross Profit Margin</P>
<P class=indent>Warren&#8217;s perspective is to look for companies that have some kind of durable competitive advantage&#8212;businesses that he can profit from over the long run.

In the tech world&#8212;a field Warren stays away from because he doesn&#8217;t understand it&#8212;Microsoft shows a consistent gross profit margin of 79%, while Apple Inc. comes in at 33%. These percentages indicate that Microsoft produces better economics selling operating systems and software than Apple does selling hardware and services.

What creates a high gross profit margin is the company&#8217;s durable competitive advantage, which allows it the freedom to price the products and services it sells well in excess of its cost of goods sold. Without a competitive advantage, companies have to compete by lowering the price of the product or service they are selling. That drop, of course, lowers their profit margins and therefore their profitability.

<P class=indent>As a very general rule (and there are exceptions): Companies with gross profit margins of 40% or better tend to be companies with some sort of durable competitive advantage. Companies with gross profit margins below 40% tend to be companies in highly competitive industries, where competition is hurting overall profit margins (there are exceptions here, too). Any gross profit margin of 20% and below is usually a <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=35 id=page_35></SPAN>good indicator of a fiercely competitive industry, where no one company can create a sustainable competitive advantage over the competition. And a company in a fiercely competitive industry, without some kind of competitive advantage working in its favor, is never going to make us rich over the long run.

While the gross profit margin test is not fail-safe, it is one of the early indicators that the company in question has some kind of consistent durable competitive advantage. Warren strongly emphasizes the word &#8220;durable,&#8221; and to be on the safe side we should track the annual gross profit margins for the last ten years to ensure that the &#8220;consistency&#8221; is there. Warren knows that when we look for companies with a durable competitive advantage, &#8220;consistency&#8221; is the name of the game.
