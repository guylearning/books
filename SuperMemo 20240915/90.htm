<P>As a child, I had a goofy recurring daydream: maybe if I type just the right sequence of keys, the computer would beep a few times in sly recognition, then a hidden world would suddenly unlock before my eyes. I&#8217;d find myself with new powers which I could use to transcend my humdrum life.</P>
<P>Such fantasies probably came from playing too many video games. But the feelings I have when using spaced repetition systems are strikingly similar. At their best, these systems feel like magic.<SPAN class="sidenote inline">This guide assumes basic familiarity with spaced repetition systems. For an introduction, see Michael Nielsen, <A href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html"><FONT color=#0066cc>Augmenting Long-term Memory</FONT></A> (2018), which is also the source of the phrase &#8220;makes memory a choice.&#8221;</SPAN> Memory ceases to be a haphazard phenomenon, something you hope happens: spaced repetition systems make memory a choice. Used well, they can accelerate learning, facilitate creative work, <A href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Spaced_repetition_systems_can_be_used_to_program_attention"><FONT color=#0066cc>and more</FONT></A>. But like in my childhood daydreams, these wonders unfold only when you press just the right sequence of keys, producing just the right incantation. That is, when you manage to write good prompts&#8212;the questions and answers you review during practice sessions.</P>
<P>Spaced repetition systems work only as well as the prompts you give them. And especially when new to these systems, you&#8217;re likely to give them mostly bad prompts. It often won&#8217;t even be clear which prompts are bad and why, much less how to improve them. My early experiments with spaced repetition systems felt much like my childhood daydreams: prodding a dusty old artifact, hoping it&#8217;ll suddenly spring to life and reveal its magic.</P>
<P>Happily, prompt-writing does not require arcane secrets. It&#8217;s possible to understand somewhat systematically what makes a given prompt effective or ineffective. From that basis, you can understand how to write good prompts. Now, there are many ways to use spaced repetition systems, and so there are many ways to write good prompts. This guide aims to help you <EM>create understanding</EM> in the context of an informational resource like an article or talk. By that I mean writing prompts not only to durably internalize the overt knowledge presented by the author, but also to produce and reinforce understandings of your own, understandings which you can carry into your life and creative work.</P>
<P>For readers who are new to spaced repetition, this guide will help you overcome common problems that often lead people to abandon these systems. In later sections, we&#8217;ll cover some unusual prompt-writing perspectives which may help more experienced readers deepen their practice.<SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>If you don&#8217;t have a spaced repetition system, I&#8217;d suggest downloading </FONT><A href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>Anki</FONT></A><FONT size=3> and reading </FONT><A href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>Michael&#8217;s aforementioned essay</FONT></A><FONT size=3>.</FONT></SPAN> Our discussion will focus on high-level principles, so you can follow along using any spaced repetition system you like. Let&#8217;s get started.</P>
<H2 id=retrieval>The central role of retrieval practice</H2>
<P>No matter the application, it&#8217;s helpful to remember that when you write a prompt in a spaced repetition system, you are giving your future self a recurring task. Prompt design is task design.</P>
<P>If a prompt &#8220;works,&#8221; it&#8217;s because performing that task changes you in some useful way. It&#8217;s worth trying to understand the mechanisms behind those changes, so you can design tasks which produce the kind of change you want.</P>
<P>The most common mechanism of change for spaced repetition learning tasks is called <I>retrieval practice.</I> In brief: when you attempt to recall some knowledge from memory, the act of retrieval tends to reinforce those memories.<SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>For more background, see Roediger and Karpicke, </FONT><A href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Roediger2006.pdf"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>The Power of Testing Memory</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (2006). Gwern Branwen&#8217;s </FONT><A href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>article on spaced repetition</FONT></A><FONT size=3> is a good popular overview.</FONT></SPAN> You&#8217;ll forget that knowledge more slowly. With a few retrievals strategically spaced over time, you can effectively halt forgetting. The physical mechanisms are not yet understood, but hundreds of cognitive scientists have explored this effect experimentally, reproducing the central findings across various subjects, knowledge types (factual, conceptual, procedural, motor), and testing modalities (multiple choice, short answer, oral examination).</P>
<P>The value of fluent recall isn&#8217;t just in memorizing facts. Many of these experiments tested students not with parroted memory questions but by asking them to make inferences, draw concept maps<SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>See e.g. Karpicke and Blunt, </FONT><A href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Karpicke2011.pdf"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>Retrieval Practice Produces More Learning than Elaborative Studying with Concept Mapping</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (2011); and Blunt and Karpicke, </FONT><A href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Blunt2014.pdf"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>Learning With Retrieval-Based Concept Mapping</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (2014).</FONT></SPAN>, or answer open-ended questions. In these studies, improved recall translated into improved general understanding and problem-solving ability.</P>
<P><I>Retrieval</I> is the key element which distinguishes this effective mode of practice from typical study habits. Simply <I>reminding</I> yourself of material (for instance by re-reading it) yields much weaker memory and problem-solving performance. The learning produced by retrieval is called the &#8220;testing effect&#8221; because it occurs when you explicitly test yourself, reaching within to recall some knowledge from the tangle of your mind. Such tests look like typical school exams, but in some sense they&#8217;re the opposite: retrieval practice is about testing your knowledge to <I>produce</I> learning, rather than to assess learning.</P>
<P>Spaced repetition systems are designed to facilitate this effect. If you want prompts to reinforce your understanding of some topic, you must learn to write prompts which collectively invoke retrieval practice of all the key details.</P>
<P>We&#8217;ll have to step outside the scientific literature to understand how to write good prompts: existing evidence stops well short of exact guidance. In lieu of that, I&#8217;ve distilled the advice in this guide from my personal experience writing thousands of prompts, grounded where possible in experimental evidence.</P>
<P><SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>For more background on the mnemonic medium, see Matuschak and Nielsen, </FONT><A href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>How can we develop transformative tools for thought?</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (2019).</FONT></SPAN>This guide is an example of what Michael Nielsen and I have called a <EM>mnemonic medium</EM>. It exemplifies its own advice through spaced repetition prompts interleaved directly into the text. If you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;ve probably already used a spaced repetition system. This guide&#8217;s system, <A href="https://withorbit.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>Orbit</FONT></A>, works similarly.<SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>If you have an existing spaced repetition practice, you may find it annoying to review prompts in two places. As Orbit matures, we&#8217;ll release import / export tools to solve this problem.</FONT></SPAN> But it has a deeper aspiration: by integrating expert-authored prompts into the reading experience, authors can write texts which readers can deeply internalize with relatively little effort. If you&#8217;re an author, then, this guide may help you learn how to write good prompts both for your personal practice and also for publications you write using <A href="https://withorbit.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>Orbit</FONT></A>. You can of course read this guide without answering the embedded prompts, but I hope you&#8217;ll give it a try.</P><ORBIT-REVIEWAREA><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="Spaced repetition prompts reinforce your memory through {retrieval} practice (cognitive science term)."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="How do your actions differ in retrieval practice versus studying by re-reading?" answer="Retrieval practice involves actively recalling information from memory."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="What distinguishes retrieval practice from typical school tests?" answer="Its purpose is to *produce* learning, not assess it."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="In general, writing an SRS prompt amounts to giving your future self a recurring {task}."></ORBIT-PROMPT></ORBIT-REVIEWAREA>
<P>These embedded prompts are part of an ongoing research project. The first experiment in the mnemonic medium was <EM><A href="https://quantum.country/"><FONT color=#0066cc>Quantum Country</FONT></A></EM>, a primer on quantum computation. Quantum Country is concrete and technical: definitions, notation, laws. By contrast, this guide mostly presents heuristics, mental models, and advice. The embedded prompts therefore play quite different roles in these two contexts. You may not need to memorize precise definitions here, but I believe the prompts will help you internalize the guide&#8217;s ideas and put them into action. On the other hand, this guide&#8217;s material may be too contingent and too personal to benefit from author-provided prompts. It&#8217;s an experiment, and I invite you to <A>tell me about your experiences</A>.</P>
<P>One important limitation is worth noting. This guide describes how to write prompts which produce and reinforce understandings of your own, going beyond what the author explicitly provides. Orbit doesn&#8217;t yet offer readers the ability to remix author-provided prompts or add their own. Future work will expand the system in that direction.</P>
<H3 id=properties>Properties of effective retrieval practice prompts</H3>
<P>Writing good prompts feels surprisingly similar to translating written text. When translating prose into another language, you&#8217;re asking: which words, when read, would light a similar set of bulbs in readers&#8217; minds? It&#8217;s not a rote operation. If the passage involves allusion, metaphor, or humor, you won&#8217;t translate literally. You&#8217;ll try to find words which recreate the experience of reading the original for a member of a foreign culture.</P>
<P>When writing spaced repetition prompts meant to invoke retrieval practice, you&#8217;re doing something similar to language translation. You&#8217;re asking: which tasks, when performed in aggregate, require lighting the bulbs which are activated when you have that idea &#8220;fully loaded&#8221; into your mind?</P>
<P>The retrieval practice mechanism implies some core properties of effective prompts. We&#8217;ll review them briefly here, and the rest of this guide will illustrate them through many examples.</P>
<P>These properties aren&#8217;t laws of nature. They&#8217;re more like rules you might learn in an English class. Good writers can (and should!) strategically break the rules of grammar to produce interesting effects. But you need to have enough experience to understand <EM>why</EM> doing something different makes sense in a given context.</P>
<P>Retrieval practice prompts should be <B><FONT color=#3a3a3a>focused.</FONT></B> A question or answer involving too much detail will dull your concentration and stimulate incomplete retrievals, leaving some bulbs unlit. Unfocused questions also make it harder to check whether you remembered all parts of the answer and to note places where you differed. It&#8217;s usually best to focus on one detail at a time.</P>
<P>Retrieval practice prompts should be <B><FONT color=#3a3a3a>precise</FONT></B> about what they&#8217;re asking for. Vague questions will elicit vague answers, which won&#8217;t reliably light the bulbs you&#8217;re targeting.</P>
<P>Retrieval practice prompts should produce <B><FONT color=#3a3a3a>consistent</FONT></B> answers, lighting the same bulbs each time you perform the task. Otherwise, you may run afoul of an interference phenomenon called &#8220;retrieval-induced forgetting&#8221;<SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>This effect has been produced in many experiments but is not yet well understood. For an overview, see Murayama et al, </FONT><A href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Murayama2014.pdf"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>Forgetting as a consequence of retrieval: a meta-analytic review of retrieval-induced forgetting</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (2014).</FONT></SPAN>: what you remember during practice is reinforced, but other related knowledge which you <I>didn&#8217;t</I> recall is actually inhibited. Now, there is a useful type of prompt which involves generating new answers with each repetition, but such prompts leverage a different theory of change. We&#8217;ll discuss them briefly later in this guide.</P>
<P><SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>SuperMemo&#8217;s algorithms (also used by most other major systems) are tuned for 90% accuracy. Each review would likely have a larger impact on your memory if you targeted much lower accuracy numbers&#8212;see e.g. Carpenter et al, </FONT><A href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Carpenter2012.pdf"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>Using Spacing to Enhance Diverse Forms of Learning</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (2012). Higher accuracy targets trade efficiency for reliability.</FONT></SPAN>Retrieval practice prompts should be <B><FONT color=#3a3a3a>tractable</FONT></B>. To avoid interference-driven churn and recurring annoyance in your review sessions, you should strive to write prompts which you can almost always answer correctly. This often means breaking the task down, or adding cues.</P>
<P>Retrieval practice prompts should be <B><FONT color=#3a3a3a>effortful</FONT></B>. It&#8217;s important that the prompt actually involves retrieving the answer from memory. You shouldn&#8217;t be able to trivially infer the answer. Cues are helpful, as we&#8217;ll discuss later&#8212;just don&#8217;t &#8220;give the answer away.&#8221; In fact, effort appears to be an important factor in the effects of retrieval practice.<SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>For more on the notion that difficult retrievals have a greater impact than easier retrievals, see the discussion in Bjork and Bjork, </FONT><A href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Bjork1992.pdf"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>A New Theory of Disuse and an Old Theory of Stimulus Fluctuation</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (1992). Pyc and Rawson, </FONT><A href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Pyc2009.pdf"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>Testing the retrieval effort hypothesis: Does greater difficulty correctly recalling information lead to higher levels of memory?</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (2009) offers some focused experimental tests of this theory, which they coin the &#8220;retrieval effort hypothesis.&#8221;</FONT></SPAN> That&#8217;s one motivation for spacing reviews out over time: if it&#8217;s too easy to recall the answer, retrieval practice has little effect.</P>
<P>Achieving these properties is mostly about writing tightly-scoped questions. When a prompt&#8217;s scope is too broad, you&#8217;ll usually have problems: retrieval will often lack a focused target; you may produce imprecise or inconsistent answers; you may find the prompt intractable. But writing tightly-scoped questions is surprisingly difficult. You&#8217;ll need to break knowledge down into its discrete components so that you can build those pieces back up as prompts for retrieval practice. This decomposition also makes review more efficient. The schedule will rapidly remove easy material from regular practice while ensuring you frequently review the components you find most difficult.</P>
<P>Now imagine you&#8217;ve just read a long passage on a new topic. What, specifically, would have to be true for you to say you &#8220;know&#8221; it? To continue the translation metaphor, you must learn to &#8220;read&#8221; the language of knowledge&#8212;recognizing nouns and verbs, sentence structures, narrative arcs&#8212;so that you can write their analogues in the translated language. Some details are essential; some are trivial. And you can&#8217;t stop with what&#8217;s on the page: a good translator will notice allusions and draw connections of their own.</P>
<P>So we must learn two skills to write effective retrieval practice prompts: how to characterize exactly what knowledge we&#8217;ll reinforce, and how to ask questions which reinforce that knowledge.</P><ORBIT-REVIEWAREA><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="Focus: Prompts with too much detail tend to {dull} your {concentration}."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="Precision: Vague questions will elicit {vague} answers."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="When prompts produce inconsistent answers, what happens to the memories which aren't retrieved?" answer="They're inhibited."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="How often do spaced repetition systems expect you to be able to answer a given prompt in review sessions?" answer="Almost always."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="How does question scope impact spaced repetition scheduler efficiency?" answer="Tightly-scoped prompts allow easy and difficult elements to be scheduled at different rates."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="Focus: Prompts with too much detail tend to stimulate {incomplete} retrievals."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="Why is it important that you can't infer a prompt's answer from the question?" answer="Retrieval practice depends on recalling the answer from memory."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="(This guide's) properties of effective prompts: {focused}, {precise}, {consistent}, {tractable}, {effortful}"></ORBIT-PROMPT></ORBIT-REVIEWAREA>
<H2 id=recipe>A recipe for chicken stock</H2>
<P>Our discussion so far has been awfully abstract. We&#8217;ll continue by analyzing a concrete example: a recipe for chicken stock.</P>
<P>A recipe may seem like a fairly trivial target for prompt-writing, and in some sense that&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s a conveniently short and self-contained example. But in fact, my spaced repetition library contains hundreds of prompts capturing foundational recipes, techniques, and observations from the kitchen. This is itself an essential prompt-writing skill to build&#8212;noticing unusual but meaningful applications for prompts&#8212;so I&#8217;ll briefly describe my experience.</P>
<P>I&#8217;d cooked fairly seriously for about a decade before I began to use spaced repetition, and of course I naturally internalized many core techniques and ratios. Yet whenever I was making anything complex, I&#8217;d constantly pause to consult references, which made it difficult to move with creativity and ease. I rarely felt &#8220;flow&#8221; while cooking. My experiences felt surprisingly similar to my first few years learning to program, in which I encountered exactly the same problems. With years of full-time attention, I automatically internalized all the core knowledge I needed day-to-day as a programmer. I&#8217;m sure that I&#8217;d eventually do the same in the kitchen, but since cooking has only my part-time attention, the process might take a few more decades.</P>
<P>I started writing prompts about core cooking knowledge three years ago, and it&#8217;s qualitatively changed my life in the kitchen. These prompts have accelerated my development of a deeply satisfying ability: to show up at the market, choose what looks great in that moment, and improvise a complex meal with confidence. If the sunchokes look good, I know they&#8217;d pair beautifully with the mustard greens I see nearby, and I know what else I need to buy to prepare those vegetables as I imagine. When I get home, I already know how to execute the meal; I can move easily about the kitchen, not hesitating to look something up every few minutes. Despite what this guide&#8217;s lengthy discussion might suggest, these prompts don&#8217;t take me much time to write. Every week or two I&#8217;ll trip on something interesting and spend a few minutes writing prompts about it. That&#8217;s been enough to produce a huge impact.</P>
<DIV class=recipe>
<P>At a decent restaurant, even simple foods often taste much better than most home cooks&#8217; renditions. Saut&#233;ed vegetables seem richer; grains seem richer; sauces seem more luscious. One key reason for this is <I>stock</I>, a flavorful liquid building block. Restaurants often use stocks in situations where home cooks might use water: adding a bit of steam to saut&#233;ed vegetables, thinning a pur&#233;e, simmering whole grains, etc. Stocks are also the base of many sauces, soups, and braises.</P>
<P>Stock is made by simmering flavorful ingredients in water. By varying the ingredients, we can produce different types of stock: chicken stock, vegetable stock, mushroom stock, pork stock, and so on. But unlike a typical broth, stock isn&#8217;t meant to have a distinctive flavor that can stand on its own. Instead, its job is to provide a versatile foundation for other preparations.</P>
<P>One of the most useful stocks is chicken stock. When used to prepare vegetables, chicken stock doesn&#8217;t make them taste like chicken: it makes them taste more savory and complete. It also adds a luxurious texture because it&#8217;s rich in gelatin from the chicken bones. Chicken stock takes only a few minutes of active time to make, and in a typical kitchen, it&#8217;s basically free: the primary ingredient is chicken bones, which you can naturally accumulate in your freezer if you cook chicken regularly.</P>
<H3>Recipe</H3>
<UL>
<LI>2lbs (~1kg) chicken bones </LI>
<LI>2qt (~2L) water </LI>
<LI>1 onion, roughly chopped </LI>
<LI>2 carrots, roughly chopped </LI>
<LI>2 ribs of celery, roughly chopped </LI>
<LI>4 cloves garlic, smashed </LI>
<LI>half a bunch of fresh parsley </LI></UL>
<OL>
<LI>Combine all the ingredients in a large pot. </LI>
<LI>Bring to a simmer on low heat (this will take about an hour). We use low heat to produce a bright, clean flavor: at higher temperatures, the stock will both taste and look duller. </LI>
<LI>Lower heat to maintain a bare simmer for an hour and a half. </LI>
<LI>Strain, wait until cool, then transfer to storage containers. </LI></OL>
<P>Chicken stock will keep for a week in the fridge or indefinitely in the freezer. There will be a cap of fat on the stock; skim that off before using the stock, and deploy the fat in place of oil or butter in any savory cooking situation.</P>
<P>This recipe can be scaled up or down to the quantity of chicken bones you have. The basic ratio is a pound of bones to a quart of water. The vegetables are flexible in choice and ratio.</P>
<H3>Variations</H3>
<P>For a more French flavor profile, replace the celery with leeks and add any/all of bay leaves, black peppercorns, and thyme. For a deeper flavor, roast the bones and vegetables first to make what&#8217;s called a &#8220;brown chicken stock&#8221; (the recipe above is for a &#8220;white chicken stock,&#8221; which is more delicate but also more versatile).</P>
<H3>What to do with chicken stock</H3>
<P>A few ideas for what you might do with your chicken stock:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cook barley, farro, couscous and other grains in it. </LI>
<LI>Pur&#233;e with roasted vegetables to make soup. </LI>
<LI>Wilt hearty greens like kale, chard, or collards in oil, then add a bit of stock and cover to steam through. </LI>
<LI>After roasting or pan-searing meat, deglaze the pan with stock to make a quick sauce. </LI></UL></DIV>
<P>To organize our efforts, it&#8217;s helpful to ask: what would it mean to &#8220;know&#8221; this material? I&#8217;d suggest that someone who &#8220;knows&#8221; this material should:</P>
<UL>
<LI>know how to make and store chicken stock </LI>
<LI>know what stock is and (at least shallowly) understand why and when it matters </LI>
<LI>know the role and significance of chicken stock, specifically </LI>
<LI>know some ways one might use chicken stock, both generally and with some specific examples </LI>
<LI>know of a few common variations and when they might be used </LI></UL>
<P>Some of this knowledge is factual; some of it is procedural; some of it is conceptual. We&#8217;ll see strategies for dealing with each of these types of knowledge.</P>
<P>But understanding is inherently personal. Really &#8220;knowing&#8221; something often involves going beyond what&#8217;s on the page to connect it to your life, other ideas you&#8217;re exploring, and other activities you find meaningful. We&#8217;ll also look at how to write questions of that kind.</P>
<P><SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>If you&#8217;re a vegetarian, I hope you can look past the discussion of bones: choosing this example involved many trade-offs.</FONT></SPAN>In this guide, we&#8217;ll imagine that you&#8217;re an interested home cook who&#8217;s never made stock before. Naturally, if you&#8217;re an experienced cook, you&#8217;d probably need only a few of these prompts. And of course, if you don&#8217;t cook at all, you&#8217;d write none of these prompts! Try to read the examples as demonstrations of how you might internalize a resource deeply without much prior fluency.</P>
<P>To demonstrate a wide array of principles, we&#8217;ll treat this material quite exhaustively. But it&#8217;s worth noting that in practice, you usually won&#8217;t study resources as systematically as this. You&#8217;ll jump around, focusing only on the parts which seem most valuable. You may return to a resource on a few occasions, writing more prompts as you understand what&#8217;s most relevant. That&#8217;s good! Exhaustiveness may seem righteous in a shallow sense, but an obsession with completionism will drain your gumption and waste attention which could be better spent elsewhere. We&#8217;ll return to this issue in greater depth later.</P>

<H3>Chicken stock</H3>
<P>At a decent restaurant, even simple foods often taste much better than most home cooks&#8217; renditions. Saut&#233;ed vegetables seem richer; grains seem richer; sauces seem more luscious. One key reason for this is <I>stock</I>, a flavorful liquid building block. Restaurants often use stocks in situations where home cooks might use water: adding a bit of steam to saut&#233;ed vegetables, thinning a pur&#233;e, simmering whole grains, etc. Stocks are also the base of many sauces, soups, and braises.</P>

<P>We&#8217;ll begin with the &#8220;recipe&#8221; section of this passage, which describes how to make and store chicken stock. It&#8217;s interesting to contrast this section&#8217;s text with the more conceptual initial paragraphs. As a form, recipes already involve a somewhat more explicit knowledge structure than you&#8217;d find in ordinary prose. This will give us a bit of a scaffold to get started.</P>
<P>To know how to make chicken stock, you must know what ingredients to collect. We&#8217;ll begin there.</P>
<P>This type of knowledge is mostly <EM>factual</EM>. There aren&#8217;t a lot of concepts or relationships here: it&#8217;s mostly just a bunch of raw information you need to know.</P>
<H3 id=simple-facts>Simple facts</H3>
<P>We could write a prompt which simply asks: &#8220;What do you need to make chicken stock?&#8221; But this isn&#8217;t <I>precise</I> enough: should we recall the quantities or just the names of the ingredients? How much chicken stock are we making? This isn&#8217;t <I>focused</I> enough: because it&#8217;s asking for so many details simultaneously, it&#8217;s unlikely to sharply activate all the memories you want to reinforce. And because it&#8217;s asking for so much, it&#8217;s liable to lead to <I>inconsistency</I> and <I>intractability</I>: each time you answer, you&#8217;ll remember some details and forget others. The inconsistent activations will tend to erode your memory.</P>
<P>We&#8217;ll need to break the ingredients list down into the elements which must actually be learned.</P>
<P>The first line is about the chicken component. If you&#8217;d never heard of stock before, you could begin by simply clarifying what kind of chicken we use:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. What type of chicken parts are used in stock?</P>
<P>A. Bones.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This question focuses on just one detail. It&#8217;s precise about what it wants (&#8220;What type of chicken parts&#8230;?&#8221;), and it should produce a consistent answer over time. It&#8217;s plenty tractable, but it still demands the effort of retrieving the answer from memory.</P>
<P>Writing a simple factual prompt like that naturally tickles a neighbor you might consider adding: the <I>explanation</I> prompt. I write prompts like this when a detail seems likely to be challenging or when the explanation itself is interesting. A more experienced cook likely wouldn&#8217;t bother with the first question, but they might still find this one useful.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Why do we use bones to make chicken stock?</P>
<P>A. They&#8217;re full of gelatin, which produces a rich texture.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The explanation question will reinforce the knowledge captured by the factual question. Perhaps more importantly, explanations make facts more meaningful. A prompt like this offers a hook to connect the fact to other ideas you may pick up in later cooking adventures. For instance, a Chinese dish of jellied chicken feet might inspire you to try using feet as some of the bones in your stock (as in fact, they&#8217;re the most gelatin-rich part).</P>
<P>Note that the answer is found in a different section of the text! Writing prompts often involves hopping around as you work to identify the puzzle pieces and put them together.</P>
<P>Now, this explanation prompt is a good first try, but it could be more precise. It would be reasonable to answer &#8220;Why do we use bones to make chicken stock?&#8221; with &#8220;Because bones are economical.&#8221; You want to write questions which cause you to unambiguously retrieve the information you have in mind. This more precise prompt is better:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. How do bones produce a chicken stock&#8217;s rich texture?</P>
<P>A. They&#8217;re full of gelatin.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><ORBIT-REVIEWAREA><ORBIT-PROMPT question='Why is this an example of a "focused" prompt?&#10;    &#10;*What type of chicken parts are used in stock?*' answer="It's about just one detail."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="You can often reinforce and add meaning to factual prompts by adding prompts about {why that fact is true}."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="Create an explanation prompt for this factual prompt:&#10;    &#10;Q.

It's full of gelatin from the bones."></ORBIT-PROMPT></ORBIT-REVIEWAREA>
<P>You may notice that one of the prompts in this review set doesn&#8217;t satisfy the consistency property. That prompt isn&#8217;t trying to engage retrieval practice, at least not like we&#8217;ve seen so far. Perhaps it doesn&#8217;t work very well&#8212;such prompts are a bit of an experiment! We&#8217;ll discuss them more later.</P>
<H3 id=lists>Lists</H3>
<P>Back to the ingredients list. Chicken stock obviously involves chicken and water: that follows from the definition of stock (which we&#8217;ll handle later). But then there are all the aromatic flavorings, which are more variable and depend somewhat on application. Understanding the ingredients in terms of functional grouping will help us internalize the structure of the recipe:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Chicken stock is made with chicken, water, and what other category of ingredients?</P>
<P>A. Aromatics.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>From here, we might ask:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. What are typical aromatics used in chicken stock?</P>
<P>A. onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>But unless you&#8217;re an experienced cook, you&#8217;ll probably find this prompt intractable, or you may remember ingredients inconsistently. Unordered lists like this can be challenging to translate into good prompts.</P>
<P>One good strategy is to create a set of questions which require you to fill in a missing element of the list:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Typical chicken stock aromatics: 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#3a3a3a>???</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI>carrots</LI>
<LI>celery</LI>
<LI>garlic</LI>
<LI>parsley</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>A. Onion</P>
<P>Q. Typical chicken stock aromatics: 
<UL>
<LI>onion</LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#3a3a3a>???</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI>celery</LI>
<LI>garlic</LI>
<LI>parsley</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>A. Carrots</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&#8230; and so on. Note that I keep the list in the same order. When each element has a consistent (though arbitrary) location, you&#8217;ll end up learning the list&#8217;s visual &#8220;shape&#8221; to some extent as you repeat these prompts. That will help your recall.</P>
<P>Most spaced repetition software has a special function which can rapidly generate sets of fill-in-the-blank prompts like this. In the software interfaces, these prompts are often called &#8220;cloze deletions.&#8221; In each review session, the software will only ask you to fill in one blank. This behavior is important because without it, one variant would &#8220;give away&#8221; the answer to another.</P>
<P>Ultimately, of course, you want to be able to recall all the ingredients on demand, not just one. Much of the time, these single-element deletions will be enough to achieve that goal. But with complex ideas, you may find you need to add integrative prompts after you&#8217;ve thoroughly practiced their discrete components. In the case of lists, you can imagine that the system could ask you to fill in more blanks simultaneously as your memory of the individual entries improves. I don&#8217;t know of any general memory system which does that, but it seems worth trying. This is one example of a general opportunity to incorporate more sophisticated knowledge modeling into these systems.</P>
<P>Another way to help yourself understand lists like this is to write explanation prompts for each of the components: <SPAN class=sidenote>A quick answer: carrot provides vegetal sweetness; like salt, this sugar brightens other flavors.</SPAN><EM>why</EM> is carrot a good aromatic for chicken stock? If you know the answer to this question for each ingredient, you&#8217;ll have an easier time generating the list on demand, perhaps without any of the cloze deletions. And as with simple facts, explanations make knowledge more meaningful. In this case, the recipe doesn&#8217;t say, so you&#8217;d need to do some research to write questions of this kind.</P><ORBIT-REVIEWAREA><ORBIT-PROMPT question="What mechanical operation transforms an unordered list into a set of focused prompts?" answer="Create a prompt for each item, showing the list with that item as a blank to be filled in."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="What name do many spaced repetition systems use for fill-in-the-blank prompts?" answer='"Cloze deletion"'></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="Why maintain list order across fill-in-the-blank prompts for unordered lists?" answer="You'll learn a consistent 'shape' of the list; the visual may help your recall."></ORBIT-PROMPT></ORBIT-REVIEWAREA>
<H3 id=cues-and-elaborative-encoding>Cues and elaborative encoding</H3>
<P>If you find yourself struggling with these prompts, it can be helpful to add a cue, like this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Typical chicken stock aromatics: 
<UL>
<LI>onion</LI>
<LI>carrots</LI>
<LI>celery</LI>
<LI>garlic</LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#3a3a3a>??? (herb)</FONT></STRONG></LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>A. Parsley</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>But make sure the cue doesn&#8217;t render the prompt trivial: it&#8217;s important that you exert some effort to retrieve the answer from memory. Consider this prompt:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Typical chicken stock aromatics: 
<UL>
<LI>onion</LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#3a3a3a>??? (rhymes with parrots)</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI>celery</LI>
<LI>garlic</LI>
<LI>parsley</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>A. Carrots</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This prompt doesn&#8217;t require you to retrieve any knowledge about chicken stock: there&#8217;s only one vegetable which rhymes with &#8220;parrots.&#8221; You could answer this without having ever read the recipe. By contrast, the previous prompt&#8217;s cue&#8212;&#8220;herb&#8221;&#8212;leaves your memory with work to do. There are many herbs, and you&#8217;ll still need to remember which one the recipe specified.</P>
<P>That said, &#8220;rhymes with parrots&#8221; may be a useful mnemonic device to add to the <I>answer</I>, offering an association to help you in the future:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Typical chicken stock aromatics: 
<UL>
<LI>onion</LI>
<LI><STRONG><FONT color=#3a3a3a>???</FONT></STRONG></LI>
<LI>celery</LI>
<LI>garlic</LI>
<LI>parsley</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>A. carrots (rhymes with &#8220;parrots&#8221;: picture a flock of parrots flying with carrots in their mouths, dropping them into a pot of stock)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Such cues engage another memory phenomenon cognitive scientists have explored experimentally: you make information easier to recall when you connect it to other memories. This process is called <I>elaborative encoding</I><SPAN class=sidenote>See e.g. Bradshaw and Anderson, <A href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Bradshaw1982.pdf"><FONT color=#0066cc>Elaborative Encoding as an Explanation of Levels of Processing</FONT></A> (1982).</SPAN>. The members of an ingredient list can be difficult to relate to anything meaningful. In such cases, you can still leverage elaborative encoding by fabricating an association as a mnemonic device. Vivid associations work best, so it&#8217;s helpful to find relationships involving visuals, meaningful personal experiences, or emotions like humor and disgust.</P>
<P>Putting these mnemonic devices in the answer field is a useful general trick when the information you&#8217;re trying to remember seems relatively arbitrary or isolated. By putting the association in parentheses, you&#8217;re making it clear that the focus of the prompt is on remembering the answer: the association is an extra tidbit you might engage with, or not.</P>
<P>This particular prompt is unlikely to require any extra help, but if you really find yourself struggling, you can add a prompt specifically intended to reinforce the association:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Mnemonic device for carrots in chicken stock?</P>
<P>A. rhymes with &#8220;parrots&#8221;: picture a flock of parrots flying with carrots in their mouths, dropping them into a pot of stock</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Instead of fabricating a mnemonic device, you can also leverage elaborative encoding by adding imagery to your prompts. The same fill-in-the-blank idea applies quite well to images. You&#8217;d probably find this prompt much easier to remember over time than its textual equivalent:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">A. Carrots</P><img src="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/aromats.jpg"> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Of course, cues and elaborative encoding add extra effort. You don&#8217;t need to use them all the time: you&#8217;d probably find that exhausting. But they&#8217;re useful techniques to deploy if you suspect a prompt will prove difficult to remember, or if you&#8217;ve noticed yourself struggling in practice.</P><ORBIT-REVIEWAREA><ORBIT-PROMPT question="If a focused prompt feels intractable, what text might you add to the question (parenthetical)?" answer="A cue."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="Add a cue to this prompt's question:&#10;    &#10;Q.

<H3 id=interpretation>Interpretation; the &#8220;more than you think&#8221; rule of thumb</H3>
<P>Now we&#8217;ve covered the ingredients which go into the stock. What about quantities?</P>
<P>Well, you could try something like: &#8220;How much chicken bone is in a batch of chicken stock?&#8221; But what&#8217;s a &#8220;batch&#8221;? This question isn&#8217;t precise enough. We could appeal to the particular recipe, asking &#8220;How much chicken bone is in Andy&#8217;s recipe for chicken stock?&#8221; But that&#8217;s not actually what we want to know: the recipe notes that you&#8217;ll want to adjust the recipe for the quantity of chicken bones you&#8217;re using. Writing good prompts often involves interpretation, a first step to creating understanding beyond what&#8217;s explicitly written.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. What&#8217;s the ratio of chicken bones to water in chicken stock?</P>
<P>A. A quart of water per pound of bones</P>
<P>Q. How much onion to use in chicken stock per pound of chicken bones?</P>
<P>A. Half an onion per pound</P>
<P>Q. How much carrots/celery to use in chicken stock per pound of chicken bones?</P>
<P>A. 1 carrot/celery rib per pound</P>
<P>Q. How much garlic to use in chicken stock per pound of chicken bones?</P>
<P>A. 2 smashed cloves per pound</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What about the parsley? Here&#8217;s another instance of interpretation: &#8220;a bunch&#8221; of parsley is not a consistent unit anyway. So I won&#8217;t bother writing prompts about parsley&#8217;s quantity; I&#8217;ll just grab a handful.</P>
<P>Notice how I&#8217;ve broken the ingredient list down into many questions here, each focused and precise. I&#8217;ve noticed that people often feel a compulsion to economize on the number of prompts they write. Prompts seem to carry a per-unit &#8220;price,&#8221; so people naturally try to write fewer questions which cover more ground. But that&#8217;s counter-productive. Unless you explicitly decide to exclude certain information, the number of &#8220;units of raw knowledge&#8221; is fixed, a constant of the territory. When you write coarser prompts in smaller quantity, you&#8217;re not reducing the amount you have to learn. You&#8217;re just making the material harder to review.</P>
<P>Prompts are cheaper than you probably imagine. An easy prompt will consume 10&#8211;30 seconds across the entire first year of practice, and much less in each subsequent year. Until you&#8217;ve internalized that observation, try to adopt this rule of thumb: write more prompts than feels natural.</P>
<P>Now, prompts are cheap, but they&#8217;re not <I>free.</I> Besides their time cost, they have an emotional cost: no one wants to spend time reviewing a bunch of boring material they already know. So if you&#8217;re writing prompts for a subject that&#8217;s already quite familiar, you should use fewer prompts&#8212;not because it&#8217;s always safe to write coarser questions for familiar topics, but because there&#8217;s less marginal knowledge you need to capture.</P>
<P>For example, you may notice that I haven&#8217;t written prompts about how the ingredients are to be prepared before they&#8217;re added to the stock. No need, I feel: roughly chopping vegetables and smashing garlic before using those ingredients as aromatics is the natural inference for most cooks who are serious enough to make stock. But if that&#8217;s not a trivial inference for you, prompt away.</P>
<P>Relatedly, the appropriate scale of a &#8220;focused&#8221; prompt depends on the scale of the concepts you&#8217;ve internalized. This particular set of aromatics is so deeply familiar as a group that I&#8217;d write prompts which treat it as a unit (&#8220;Italian aromatics&#8221;) instead of memorizing individual ingredients and quantities.</P>
<P>As you build fluency in increasingly complex concepts, you can write increasingly complex prompts while keeping each focused on what feels like a single detail. In fact, the ability to think in terms of increasingly complex &#8220;chunks&#8221; appears to be a significant part of what expertise actually is.<SPAN class=sidenote>For a compelling demonstration, see Chase and Simon, <A href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Chase1973.pdf"><FONT color=#0066cc>Perception in chess</FONT></A> (1973), which experimentally demonstrates how chess masters operate in terms of larger chunks.</SPAN> Viewed through this lens, one role for memory systems is to accelerate the process of increasing your effective chunk size in a topic.</P><ORBIT-REVIEWAREA><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="Writing good prompts often involves {interpretation}: extracting information which isn&#8217;t explicitly written."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="In our chicken stock example, how did we interpret ingredient quantities?" answer="Wrote prompts in terms of ratios, not absolute amounts."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="Prompt-writing rule of thumb: how many prompts should you write?" answer="More than feels natural."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="An easy prompt will typically consume [a few / tens of] [seconds / minutes] in the first [unit time]" answer="Tens of seconds in the first year"></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="Adding too many prompts has not only a time cost but a(n) {emotional} cost."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="What cognitive factor does the appropriate scale of a 'focused' prompt depend on?" answer="The scale of the concepts you've internalized (aka 'chunk size')"></ORBIT-PROMPT>. </ORBIT-REVIEWAREA>
<H3 id=procedural-knowledge>Procedural knowledge</H3>
<P>Now that we&#8217;ve got prompts for the ingredients, let&#8217;s look at the steps of the recipe. This is <EM>procedural</EM> knowledge&#8212;knowledge needed to perform specific tasks, more knowing how than knowing what.</P>
<P>In some sense, procedures are lists. So we can start by using the cloze-deletion method we used for the ingredient list:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: 
<OL>
<LI>???</LI>
<LI>Bring to a simmer on low heat (this will take about an hour). We use low heat to produce a bright, clean flavor: at higher temperatures, the stock will both taste and look duller.</LI>
<LI>Lower heat to maintain a bare simmer for an hour and a half.</LI>
<LI>Strain, wait until cool, then transfer to storage containers.</LI></OL>
<P></P>
<P>A. Combine all the ingredients in a large pot.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&#8230; and so on, for each of the four steps.</P>
<P>This is an awfully unfocused prompt. It includes many unimportant details which distract from the knowledge you actually intend to retrieve. In my experience, wordy prompts like these tend to dull my concentration and produce vague, distracted answers.</P>
<P>We can improve this prompt somewhat by simply removing words. If necessary, we can add extra prompts to cover any details we removed.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: 
<OL>
<LI>???</LI>
<LI>Slowly bring to a simmer</LI>
<LI>Maintain bare simmer for 90m</LI>
<LI>Strain, wait until cool, then store</LI></OL>
<P>A. Combine all ingredients</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is better. But editing down the procedure helps us make a few observations about this knowledge. First: a few keywords (or word groups) carry the critical details of the procedure: <B><FONT color=#3a3a3a>slowly</FONT></B> bring to a <B><FONT color=#3a3a3a>simmer</FONT></B>, then maintain <B><FONT color=#3a3a3a>bare simmer</FONT></B> for <B><FONT color=#3a3a3a>90m.</FONT></B> If you know those four bolded phrases, you basically know this procedure. The other words are just a skeleton. Which brings us to a second observation: the first and fourth steps aren&#8217;t worth writing prompts about. If you know what stock is (and we&#8217;ll get to that), you know you&#8217;re simmering a bunch of ingredients in a pot. When the stock is finished simmering, the final step is common sense. What else would you do?</P>
<P>After highlighting keywords in this way, prompt-writing often feels like playing Jeopardy: can you phrase that in the form of a question? Here&#8217;s a revised set of questions which capture my understanding of this procedure.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. At what speed should you heat a pot of ingredients for chicken stock?</P>
<P>A. Slowly.</P>
<P>Q. When making chicken stock, when should you lower the heat? </P>
<P>A. After the pot reaches a simmer.</P>
<P>Q. When making chicken stock, what should you do after the pot reaches a simmer?</P>
<P>A. Lower the temperature to a bare simmer.</P>
<P>Q. How long must chicken stock simmer?</P>
<P>A. 90m.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Procedures can often be broken down into keywords like this. What are the important verbs, and when should you move between them? What are the key adjectives, adverbs, subjects, objects?</P>
<P>In our stock recipe, the verbs aren&#8217;t very important: &#8220;bring,&#8221; &#8220;lower,&#8221; &#8220;strain.&#8221; You&#8217;re cooking ingredients in water at various temperatures, so those actions are obvious. But conditions or heuristics describing when to move between verbs are important: first when the water reaches a simmer, then after ninety minutes passes. And while it&#8217;s not worth capturing the fact that you&#8217;re heating the pot, the adverb &#8220;slowly&#8221; is indeed important.</P>
<P>The recipe is quite linear, but more complex procedures may branch, including conditions or special cases which could trigger some alternate path in the flowchart. Such predicate structures are usually worth capturing. If the branching is sufficiently complex, you might consider drawing a flowchart and using that in your prompt.</P>
<P>Is the keyword-based approach better than the list-based approach? That depends on how important the discrete details are and how intuitive they are for you. The keyword-based approach emphasizes the individual knowledge components more strongly, which is a good idea if precision is important. Also, I usually find focused questions like these more pleasant to answer. But if an outline is all you need, then the list approach is probably simpler.</P>
<P>It&#8217;s worth noting that in our editing, we&#8217;ve left behind a few useful details from the original recipe. Let&#8217;s re-add them with separate prompts:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. How long should it take to heat a batch of chicken stock (with 2lbs of bones)?</P>
<P>A. About an hour</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This knowledge isn&#8217;t essential, but &#8220;heads-up!&#8221;-type information can be quite useful when learning procedures. If you know this detail, you&#8217;ll leave yourself enough time when making stock, you won&#8217;t be confused when your pot takes forever to heat up, and you might notice that you&#8217;re using too high a temperature if the pot boils in fifteen minutes.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Why does Andy&#8217;s recipe claim we should prepare chicken stock over low heat?</P>
<P>A. &#8220;Brighter, cleaner&#8221; flavor.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Explanation-type prompts are especially valuable when studying procedures: they can help you avoid rote learning and build a deeper understanding. Note that in this particular case, we were only able to traverse one level of &#8220;why.&#8221; Why low heat? A cleaner flavor, says the recipe. Why does low heat produce a cleaner flavor? It doesn&#8217;t say. You might find yourself wondering what &#8220;brighter&#8221; or &#8220;cleaner&#8221; really even means. Writing this prompt revealed a gap in our understanding: how useful! We could dig into this question, but we&#8217;ll choose to keep moving for the moment. We indicate that by explicitly phrasing the answer as tentative, reliant on an external claim.</P>
<P>It&#8217;s helpful to add similar caveats to your prompts whenever you&#8217;re working with subjective, provisional, or incomplete information. In some sense, most of the prompts we&#8217;ve been writing are provisional: other recipes will probably do things somewhat differently. So we could phrase everything more tentatively, but in practice that&#8217;s more distracting than it&#8217;s worth. It&#8217;s usually enough to record where the information came from. Most spaced repetition systems have metadata fields you could use to link these prompts to the original chicken stock recipe.</P><ORBIT-REVIEWAREA><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="Simple procedures can be mechanically translated into a single set of prompts by treating the steps like a {list.}"></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="To emphasize discrete details of procedures in prompts, what should you identify?" answer="Keywords (important verbs, conditions, adjectives, adverbs, subjects, objects)"></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="What must you know to move between the steps of a procedure?" answer="Conditions/heuristics for when to stop doing one thing and start doing another."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="What should you do when writing prompts about provisional knowledge?" answer="Frame the prompt tentatively (e.g. through caveats, phrasing)"></ORBIT-PROMPT></ORBIT-REVIEWAREA>

<P>We&#8217;ve written prompts about how to make chicken stock. Now it&#8217;s your turn. Use what we&#8217;ve learned so far to write prompts representing your understanding of this paragraph on storage notes:</P>
<P class=recipe>This will yield about 1.5 qt. Chicken stock will keep for a week in the fridge or indefinitely in the freezer. Once chilled, there will be a cap of fat on the stock; skim that off before using the stock, and deploy the fat in place of oil or butter in any savory cooking situation.</P>

<DIV class=epigram>

<P class=author>&#8212; Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations</P></DIV>
<P>Now we turn our attention to the first few paragraphs of that recipe. Definitions seem like the simplest things to write prompts for: after all, isn&#8217;t that how flashcards are most commonly used in school?</P>
<P>For instance, what about a pair of definition prompts, like this?:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. What is stock?</P>
<P>A. A flavorful liquid building block.</P>
<P>Q. Culinary term for flavorful liquid building block?</P>
<P>A. Stock.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Leaving aside quibbles about focus, precision, and consistency, we could probably memorize the verbatim answer to the first question. The reverse definition can help you remember the name for this term, which is often useful. But the ability to parrot these answers isn&#8217;t at all the same as knowing <I>what stock is.</I></P>
<P>Stock is a concept. Knowing the meaning of a concept like &#8220;stock&#8221; is different from high school flashcard knowledge&#8212;for instance knowing that &#8220;correre&#8221; in Italian means &#8220;to run.&#8221; To internalize a concept, you need to understand its components and relationships. Your goal is to design a set of prompts which collectively trace the edges of &#8220;stock.&#8221;</P>
<P>I&#8217;ll now introduce some useful lenses for understanding concepts. You won&#8217;t necessarily need to use every lens for each concept you encounter. Think of them as a toolkit for identifying elements which seem most important to you. Most of these example prompts are best suited to a novice cook.

<H3 id=exercise-chicken-conceptual>Exercise: what chicken stock is and why it matters</H3>
<P>As an exercise in modeling conceptual knowledge, try writing prompts representing your understanding of this paragraph introducing chicken stock and explaining its role:</P>
<P class=recipe>One of the most ubiquitous and useful stocks is chicken stock. Now, the point of chicken stock isn&#8217;t to make everything taste like chicken. When used to prepare vegetables, for example, chicken stock makes them taste more complete, adding background voices which harmonize with the primary flavors. It also adds a luxurious texture because it&#8217;s rich in gelatin extracted from the chicken bones. Chicken stock takes only a few minutes of active time to make, and in a typical kitchen, it&#8217;s basically free: the primary ingredient is chicken bones, which you can naturally accumulate in your freezer if you cook chicken regularly.</P>
<P class=exerciseTextAreaIntro>You can use this text box as a scratch area. What you write won&#8217;t be transmitted or saved.</P> 
<P>Here are some prompts I might write:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Q. Chicken stock doesn&#8217;t make vegetables taste like chicken; it makes them taste more ??? (according to Andy&#8217;s recipe)</P>

<P>Q. What should I do with the carcass of a roast chicken?</P>

<P>There was one prompt which I found I wanted to write but couldn&#8217;t, at least while using only the information in the recipe:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. When to use chicken stock versus other types of meat stock?</P>
<P>A. ???</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Prompt-writing can helpfully reveal such gaps in our understanding. You don&#8217;t need to stick with one resource: follow your nose; Google around; consult other references. Even if you don&#8217;t decide to follow up on the missing information immediately, you can guide future exploration by sensitizing yourself to feelings of curiosity and gaps in understanding.</P>
<P>How do these prompts compare to yours? Did I include any details you didn&#8217;t cover? Did you cover any details I missed? How do those differences strike you? How does the scope of your prompts compare to these?</P>
<P>You&#8217;ll notice that I don&#8217;t necessarily use all the lenses I introduced in the previous section. For instance, I didn&#8217;t feel there were any useful part/whole prompts to ask. And the most important attribute of chicken stock is that it&#8217;s made with chicken, but it would be silly to ask about that.</P>
<H2 id=using-chicken-stock>Using chicken stock: open lists and salience prompts</H2>
<P>There&#8217;s no sense in making a batch of chicken stock unless you know how to use it. The recipe includes a list of suggestions. How might we create understanding around this type of knowledge?</P>
<H3 id=open-lists>Open lists</H3>
<P>We learned some techniques for representing lists when we were writing prompts for our recipe&#8217;s ingredients. Could we use a similar technique here?</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Things to do with chicken stock: 
<UL>
<LI>???</LI>
<LI>wilt and steam hearty greens</LI>
<LI>make pur&#233;e soups</LI>
<LI>deglaze pans</LI></UL>
<P>A. Cook grains in it</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This prompt doesn&#8217;t work. Anything could reasonably go in that first slot. You might notice, too, that this list feels so much more arbitrary than the list of ingredients in chicken stock. The difference is that this is an <I>open</I> list. You don&#8217;t really mean to memorize this exact list, though it might be useful to name a few members on demand. No, if you keep cooking, you&#8217;ll be adding to this list your whole life. By contrast, the list of ingredients in our recipe has a fixed set of members: it&#8217;s a <I>closed</I> list.</P>
<P>I think of closed lists as a complex fact, almost an equation:</P>
<P>radius of earth = 6,371 km</P>
<P>chicken stock ingredients = onions, carrots, celery, garlic, parsley.</P>
<P><SPAN class=sidenote>In fact, if you&#8217;re an experienced cook, you probably think of the ingredients in chicken stock as an open list&#8212;if that&#8217;s true, it&#8217;d be better to represent them that way! This is a common fate for closed lists in human-scale concepts.</SPAN> I like to think of open lists like <I>tags</I>&#8212;like the tags you might use in a system for digital bookmarks. My mental filing cabinet has a tag called &#8220;way to use chicken stock,&#8221; and I&#8217;ve fastened that tag to some notes about making pur&#233;e soups.</P>
<P>When I encode this type of knowledge, I find three types of prompts consistently helpful. First I write prompts focused on each of the tagged items, linking from the instance to the tag. Then I might separately write prompts about the tag itself, perhaps inspired by patterns I notice in its instances. Finally, I often write a prompt which fuzzily links from the tag to its instances by asking for examples.</P>
<P>For example, this prompt links an instance to the tag:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. When pur&#233;eing vegetables to make soup, how can I produce a richer flavor without adding fat?</P>
<P>A. Thin the pur&#233;e with chicken stock instead of water.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>After we&#8217;ve written several prompts like this, a prompt about a pattern in the tag might suggest itself:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. What should I ask myself if I notice I&#8217;m using water in savory cooking?</P>
<P>A. &#8220;Should I use stock instead?&#8221;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It&#8217;s often useful to be able to summon examples of a tag on demand. We can write a prompt which fuzzily links the tag to instances:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Name two ways you might use chicken stock.</P>
<P>A. e.g. cooking grains, steaming hearty greens, making pur&#233;e soups, deglazing pans</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This type of prompt is easy to write, so it&#8217;s tempting to write something similar and be done with it. But prompts like this usually don&#8217;t work well without other prompts supporting it. You&#8217;ll probably find yourself giving the same examples each time. In the absence of additional prompts, you&#8217;ll likely forget about the other instances. If you <I>do</I> change your answer each time, the prompt won&#8217;t satisfy the consistency property we&#8217;ve introduced, and interference effects may leave your memory unreliable without other supporting prompts.</P>
<P>When you&#8217;ve just learned a particularly open-ended concept&#8212;one which could apply to many instances&#8212;you can turn example-generating prompts like the one above into creative prompts like this one:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Name a vegetable pur&#233;e soup which you might try making with chicken stock (give an answer you haven&#8217;t given before)</P>
<P>A. e.g. potato, parsnip, celeriac, sunchoke, salsify, squash, carrot, pepper, lentil&#8230;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The novelty admonition is an interesting trick: &#8220;give an answer you haven&#8217;t given before.&#8221; Sure, after a year or two, maybe you&#8217;ll re-use a vegetable without realizing it. That&#8217;s fine. But note that you probably can&#8217;t write a prompt like this one about contexts to use chicken stock, unless you have enough prior experience to generate plenty of different answers.</P>
<P>This isn&#8217;t really a retrieval prompt anymore. Creative prompts are more like a textbook exercise, asking you to apply what you&#8217;ve learned in a new way. Unlike the other prompts we&#8217;ve seen, the goal here is to <EM>avoid</EM> retrieving an answer from memory: you&#8217;re meant to think creatively for a few moments. Since your answer&#8217;s different each time, retrieval practice won&#8217;t consistently reinforce your memory of any particular response. Instead, it will reinforce whatever knowledge you consistently use when <EM>generating</EM> an answer. Your novel responses may also make meaningful associations which strengthen your memory through elaborative encoding. And those associations may be particularly sticky because of<SPAN class=sidenote>See Slamecka and Graf, <A href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Slamecka1978.pdf"><FONT color=#0066cc>The Generation Effect: Delineation of a Phenomenon</FONT></A> (1978).</SPAN> another memory phenomenon called the generation effect: you remember information better when you generated it yourself.</P>

<P>Besides their impact on memory and understanding, many of the prompts we&#8217;ve been discussing about have another important effect: they keep you in contact with an idea over time.</P>
<P>Have you ever heard about something for the first time, then suddenly noticed it everywhere? Maybe you learn an unusual word like &#8220;mellifluous,&#8221; then spot it several times in the following days. In 1994 a pseudonymous internet commenter <A href="https://www.twincities.com/2007/02/23/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon-or-the-joy-of-juxtaposition-responsorial-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23-23/"><FONT color=#0066cc>dubbed this</FONT></A> the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon (after being surprised to see two independent references to that terrorist group within a day). Stanford linguistics professor Arnold Zwicky <A href="https://web.stanford.edu/~zwicky/LSA07illude.abst.pdf"><FONT color=#0066cc>suggests</FONT></A> that this effect is a kind of selective attention: new ideas are particularly salient, so we notice them more readily. They haven&#8217;t really become more common&#8212;they just seem that way.</P>
<P>Sometimes this effect isn&#8217;t helpful. You can probably remember a time when a friend learned a new idea, and then everything became an (inappropriate) nail for their new hammer. But to really internalize a new idea, you need to bring it into your life and make meaning with it. In particular, if it&#8217;s a new skill, you probably haven&#8217;t really understood it until you&#8217;ve put it into practice several times on your own.</P>
<P>Salience typically fades over time. If you don&#8217;t soon have a chance to connect that new idea to something meaningful in your life, you may stop noticing opportunities so readily. The dynamic seems similar to the problem of forgetting knowledge over time. So one valuable use for spaced repetition prompts is to keep ideas salient, top of mind, over longer periods of time. <A href="https://www.gwern.net/index"><FONT color=#0066cc>Gwern Branwen</FONT></A> has pointed out*<SPAN class=sidenote>* In private communication.</SPAN> that such prompts are effectively trying to extend the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon and control it for a purpose.</P>
<P>We&#8217;ve already written a few prompts which focus on salience:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. What should I ask myself if I notice I&#8217;m using water in savory cooking?</P>
<P>A. &#8220;Should I use stock instead?&#8221;</P>
<P>Q. What should I do with the carcass of a roast chicken?</P>
<P>A. Freeze it and make chicken stock</P>
<P>Q. Name a vegetable pur&#233;e soup which you might try making with chicken stock (give an answer you haven&#8217;t given before)</P>
<P>A. e.g. potato, parsnip, celeriac, sunchoke, salsify, squash, carrot, pepper, lentil&#8230;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The point of those prompts isn&#8217;t really to &#8220;know&#8221; those answers intellectually. It&#8217;s to cue certain ideas, which in turn may prompt new thoughts or create new behaviors. Viewed in this way, the point of repeating these prompts over time is to keep the relevant ideas salient until they have a chance to connect to something meaningful in your life. As <A href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z39D31syJUE1gtNTREogSZiG6LDSuwygN5NDt"><FONT color=#0066cc>economist Brad DeLong suggests</FONT></A>, review sessions are surprisingly like a secular catechism.</P>
<P>Many of the Orbit prompts in this guide are of this kind. They&#8217;re meant to keep you in contact with these ideas until you can make sense of them as you write your own prompts. Odd as it may seem, I often write such prompts about my own ideas in the course of my creative work. They help me muse on an inkling or question over weeks and months, until it can hopefully grow into something more. This is one way prompt-writing can create understanding which extends beyond simply capturing knowledge from a text.</P>
<P>It&#8217;s often helpful to phrase salience prompts around contexts where those ideas might be meaningful in your life. For example, many cooks usually buy individual parts of a chicken instead of whole birds. Perhaps you&#8217;d like to start buying whole chickens so that you can use the bones for stock. This prompt demonstrates how you might target a specific situation:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. To help keep my freezer full of chicken stock, I&#8217;ll make sure to ??? instead of ??? when buying chicken.</P>
<P>A. buy whole birds; buying parts</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This example helps illustrate a broader issue. Just because you can answer a factual question about an idea, that doesn&#8217;t mean the idea will spontaneously occur to you when it&#8217;s useful.<SPAN class=sidenote>This is one facet of a broad problem in educational psychology called <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_learning"><FONT color=#0066cc>transfer of learning</FONT></A>: how do people transfer what they learn in one situation to a different one?</SPAN> I don&#8217;t have a well-grounded understanding of the difference, but in my experience, context-laden prompts (like this last example) help the leap from theory to practice. I suspect this is another reason it&#8217;s important to densely connect new ideas to old ones, as we did in the conceptual knowledge section: roughly speaking, more connections means more opportunities to trigger new knowledge.</P>
<P>What makes a spaced repetition prompt most likely to change your behavior or prompt new thoughts? What schedule should one use for repeating such prompts? If the objective isn&#8217;t memory, the schedule shouldn&#8217;t be tuned by &#8220;forgotten&#8221; and &#8220;remembered&#8221; buttons&#8212;so what should replace them? These remain open questions.</P><ORBIT-REVIEWAREA><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="Selective attention: we're more likely to notice occurrences of something when it's highly {salient.}"></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="Without intervention, how does salience tend to change over time?" answer="Fades."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="To integrate new ideas into your life, it's helpful to keep them salient until when?" answer="You can use them or connect them to something meaningful in your experience."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="How might spaced repetition prompts relate to the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon (when you hear something for the first time then suddenly notice it everywhere)?" answer="Prompts can extend that phenomenon by keeping ideas salient over time."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="When possible, phrase salience prompts around {contexts where those ideas might be meaningful in your life.}"></ORBIT-PROMPT></ORBIT-REVIEWAREA>
<H3 id=exercise-variations>Exercise: variations</H3>
<P>The chicken stock recipe includes a paragraph on variations, which are in some sense an open list. Write prompts representing your understanding of the knowledge in this paragraph:</P>
<P class=recipe>For a more French flavor profile, replace the celery with leeks and add any/all of bay leaves, black peppercorns, and thyme. For a deeper flavor, roast the bones and vegetables first to make what&#8217;s called a &#8220;brown chicken stock&#8221; (the original recipe is for a &#8220;white chicken stock,&#8221; which is more delicately flavored, making it versatile but less intense).</P>
<P class=exerciseTextAreaIntro>You can use this text box as a scratch area. What you write won&#8217;t be transmitted or saved.</P> </DIV>
<H2 id=prompts-in-practice>Writing prompts, in practice</H2>
<H3 id=iterative-prompts>Iterative prompt-writing</H3>
<P>This guide aspires to demonstrate a wide variety of techniques, so I&#8217;ve deliberately analyzed the chicken stock recipe quite exhaustively. But in practice, if you were examining a recipe for the first time, I certainly wouldn&#8217;t recommend writing dozens of prompts at once like we&#8217;ve done here. If you try to analyze everything you read so comprehensively, you&#8217;re likely to waste time and burn yourself out.</P>
<P>Those issues aside, it&#8217;s hard to write good prompts on your first exposure to new ideas. You&#8217;re still developing a sense of which details are important and which are not&#8212;both objectively, and to you personally. You likely don&#8217;t know which elements will be particularly challenging to remember (and hence worth extra reinforcement). You may not understand the ideas well enough to write prompts which access their &#8220;essence&#8221;, or which capture subtle implications. And you may need to live with new ideas for a while before you can write prompts which connect them vibrantly with whatever really matters to you.</P>
<P>All this suggests an iterative approach.</P>
<P>Say you&#8217;re reading an article that seems interesting. Try setting yourself an accessible goal: on your first pass, aim to write a small number of prompts (say, 5-10) about whatever seems most important, meaningful, or useful.</P>
<P>I find that such goals change the way I read even casual texts. When first adopting spaced repetition practice, I felt like I &#8220;should&#8221; write prompts about everything. This made reading a chore. By contrast, it feels quite freeing to aim for just a few key prompts at a time.<SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>As </FONT><A href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>Michael Nielsen notes</FONT></A><FONT size=3>, similar lightweight prompt-writing goals can enliven seminars, professional conversations, events, and so on.</FONT></SPAN> I read a notch more actively, noticing a tickle in the back of my mind: &#8220;Ooh, that&#8217;s a juicy bit! Let&#8217;s get that one!&#8221;</P>
<P>If the material is fairly simple, you may be able to write these prompts while you read. But for texts which are challenging or on an unfamiliar topic, it may be too disruptive to switch back and forth. In such cases it&#8217;s better to highlight or make note of the most important details. Then you can write prompts about your understanding of those details in a batch at the end or at a suitable stopping point. For these tougher topics, I find it&#8217;s best to focus initially on prompts about basic details you can build on: raw facts, terms, notation, etc.</P>
<P>Books are more complicated: there are many kinds of books and many ways to read them. This is true of articles, too, of course, but books amplify the variance. For one thing, you&#8217;re less likely to read a book linearly than an article. And, of course, they&#8217;re longer, so a handful of prompts will rarely suffice. The best prompt-writing approach will depend on how and why you&#8217;re reading the book, but in general, if I&#8217;m trying to internalize a non-fiction book, I&#8217;ll often begin by aiming to write a few key prompts on my first pass through a chapter or major section.</P>
<P>For many resources, one pass of prompt-writing is all that&#8217;s worth doing, at least initially. But if you have a rich text which you&#8217;re trying to internalize thoroughly, it&#8217;s often valuable to make multiple passes, even in the first reading session. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean doubling down on effort: just write another handful of apparently-useful prompts each time. <SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>For a vivid account of this process in mathematics, see Michael Nielsen, </FONT><A href="http://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>Using spaced repetition systems to see through a piece of mathematics</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (2019).</FONT></SPAN>With each iteration, you&#8217;ll likely find yourself able to understand (and write prompts for) increasingly complex details. You may notice your attention drawn to patterns, connections, and bigger-picture insights. Even better: you may begin to focus on your own observations and questions, rather than those of the author. But it&#8217;s also important to notice if you feel yourself becoming restless. There&#8217;s no deep virtue in writing a prompt about every detail. In fact, it&#8217;s much more important to remain responsive to your sense of curiosity and interest.</P>
<P><SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>Piotr Wozniak, a pioneer of spaced repetition, has been developing a system he calls </FONT><A href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>incremental reading</FONT></A><FONT size=3> which attempts to actively support this kind of iterative, incremental prompt writing.</FONT></SPAN>If you notice a feeling of duty or completionism, remind yourself that you can always write more prompts later. In fact, they&#8217;ll probably be better if you do: motivated by something meaningful, like a new connection or a gap in your understanding.</P>
<P>Let&#8217;s consider our chicken stock recipe again for a moment. If I were an aspiring cook who had never heard of stock before, I&#8217;d probably write a few prompts about what stock is and why it matters: those details seem useful beyond the scope of this single recipe, and they connect to happy dining experiences I&#8217;ve had. That&#8217;s probably all I&#8217;d do until I actually made a batch of stock for myself. At that point, I&#8217;d know which steps were obvious and which made me consult the recipe. If I found I wanted to make stock again, I&#8217;d write another batch of prompts to recall details like ingredient ratios and times. I&#8217;d try to notice places where I found myself straining, vaguely aware that I&#8217;d &#8220;read something about this&#8221; but unsure of the details. As I used my first batch of stock in subsequent dishes, I might then write prompts about those experiences. And so on.</P><ORBIT-REVIEWAREA><ORBIT-PROMPT question="What simplifying goal can you adopt to make prompt-writing feel less onerous while reading?" answer="Aim to write a small number of prompts on each pass through the text."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="When writing prompts about ideas in a challenging text, which details does Andy suggest you initially focus on?" answer="Basic details you can build on."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT cloze="If you notice a feeling of completionism when writing prompts about a text, remind yourself that {you can always write more prompts later.}"></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="Why might you be able to write better prompts from a text when you return to it later?

<H3 id=litmus>Litmus tests</H3>
<P>While you&#8217;re drafting prose, a spell checker and grammar checker can help you avoid some simple classes of error. Such tools don&#8217;t yet exist for prompt-writing, so it&#8217;s helpful to collect simple tests which can serve a similar function.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3a3a3a>False positives:</FONT></STRONG> How might you produce the correct answer without really knowing the information you intend to know?</P>
<P><EM>Discourage pattern matching.</EM> If you write a long question with unusual words or cues, you might eventually memorize the <I>shape</I> of that question and learn its corresponding answer&#8212;not because you&#8217;re really thinking about the knowledge involved, but through a mechanical pattern association. Cloze deletions seem particularly susceptible to this problem, especially when created by copying and editing passages from texts. This is best avoided by keeping questions short and simple.</P>
<P><EM>Avoid binary prompts.</EM> Questions which ask for a yes/no or this/that answer tend to require little effort and produce shallow understanding. I find I can often answer such questions without really understanding what they mean. Binary prompts are best rephrased as more open-ended prompts. For instance, the first of these can be improved by transforming it into the second:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Does chicken stock typically make vegetable dishes taste like chicken?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. How does chicken stock affects the flavor of vegetable dishes? (according to Andy&#8217;s recipe)</P>
<P>A. It makes them taste more &#8220;complete.&#8221; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Improving a binary prompt often involves connecting it to something else, like an example or an implication. The lenses in the conceptual knowledge section are useful for this.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3a3a3a>False negatives:</FONT></STRONG> How might you know the information the prompt intends to capture but <I>fail</I> to produce the correct answer? Such failures are often caused by not including enough context.</P>
<P>It&#8217;s easy to accidentally write a question which has correct answers besides the one you intend. You must include enough context that reasonable alternative answers are clearly wrong, while not including so much context that you encourage pattern matching or dilute the question&#8217;s focus.</P>
<P>For example, if you&#8217;ve just read a recipe for making an omelette, it might feel natural to ask: &#8220;What&#8217;s the first step to cook an omelette?&#8221; The answer might seem obvious relative to the recipe you just read: step one is clearly &#8220;heat butter in pan&#8221;! But six months from now, when you come back to this question, there are many reasonable answers: whisk eggs; heat butter in a pan; mince mushrooms for filling; etc.</P>
<P>One solution is to give the question extremely precise context: &#8220;What&#8217;s the first step in the Bon Appetit Jun &#8217;18 omelette recipe?&#8221; But this framing suggests the knowledge is much more provincial than it really is. When possible, general knowledge should be expressed generally, so long as you can avoid ambiguity. This may mean finding another angle on the question; for instance: &#8220;When making an omelette, how must the pan be prepared before you add the eggs?&#8221;</P>
<P>False negatives often feel like the worst nonsense from school exams: &#8220;Oh, yes, that answer is correct&#8212;but it&#8217;s not the one we were looking for. Try again?&#8221; <A href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/memory/designing-precise-cards/#allowing-correct-but-irrelevant-answers"><FONT color=#0066cc>Soren Bjornstad points out</FONT></A> that a prompt which fails to exclude alternative correct answers requires that you also memorize &#8220;what the prompt is asking.&#8221;</P><ORBIT-REVIEWAREA><ORBIT-PROMPT question="Prompt-writing litmus tests: what's a 'false positive'?" answer="You can produce the answer, but you don't know the information you intend to know."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="What false positive can arise when a prompt's question includes unusual words or cues?" answer="Pattern matching (knowing the answer by the shape of the question, without thinking about the words)"></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="What should you do with binary prompts?

<H3 id=revising>Revising prompts over time</H3>
<P>It&#8217;s often tough to diagnose issues with prompts while you&#8217;re writing them. Problems may become apparent only upon review, and sometimes only once a prompt&#8217;s repetition interval has grown to many months. Prompt-writing involves long feedback loops. So just as it&#8217;s important to write prompts incrementally over time, it&#8217;s also important to revise prompts incrementally over time, as you notice problems and opportunities.</P>
<P>In your review sessions, be alert to feeling an internal &#8220;sigh&#8221; at a prompt. Often you&#8217;ll think: &#8220;oh, jeez, this prompt&#8212;I can never remember the answer.&#8221; Or &#8220;whenever this prompt comes up, I know the answer, but I don&#8217;t really understand what it means.&#8221; Listen for those reactions and use them to drive your revision. To avoid disrupting your review session, most spaced repetition systems allow you to flag a prompt as needing revision during a review. Then once your session is finished, you can view a list of flagged prompts and improve them.</P>
<P><SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>The analogy to sentences is drawn from Matuschak and Nielsen, </FONT><A href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>How can we develop transformative tools for thought?</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (2019).</FONT></SPAN>Learning to write good prompts is like learning to write good sentences. Each of these skills sometimes seems trivial, but each can be developed to a virtuosic level. And whether you&#8217;re writing prompts or writing sentences, revision is a holistic endeavor. When editing prose, you can sometimes focus your attention on a single sentence. But to fix an awkward line, you may find yourself merging several sentences together, modifying your narrative devices, or changing broad textual structures. I find a similar observation applies to editing spaced repetition prompts. A prompt can sometimes be improved in isolation, but as my understanding shifts I&#8217;ll often want to revise holistically&#8212;merge a few prompts here, reframe others there, split these into finer details. <SPAN class=sidenote><FONT size=3>If you&#8217;ve attempted the exercises, you may notice that it&#8217;s easier to revise across question boundaries when composing multiple questions in the same text field. As an experiment, </FONT><A href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5ARNXtS5VxteskEW91S1yYTgAcLABNXsZuJE"><FONT color=#0066cc size=3>I&#8217;ve written</FONT></A><FONT size=3> almost all new prompts in 2020 as simple &#8220;Q. / A.&#8221; lines (like the examples in this guide) embedded in plaintext notes, using an old-fashioned text editor instead of a dedicated interface. I find I prefer this approach in most situations. In the future, I may release tools which allow others to write prompts in this way.</FONT></SPAN>Unfortunately, most spaced repetition interfaces treat each prompt as a sovereign unit, which makes this kind of high-level revision difficult. It&#8217;s as if you&#8217;re being asked to write a paper by submitting sentence one, then sentence two, and so on, revising only by submitting a request to edit a specific sentence number. Future systems may improve upon this limitation, but in the meantime, I&#8217;ve found I can revise prompts more effectively by simply keeping a holistic aspiration in mind.</P>
<P>In this guide, I&#8217;ve analyzed an example quite exhaustively to illustrate a wide array of principles, and I&#8217;ve advised you to write more prompts than might feel natural. So I&#8217;d like to close by offering a contrary admonition.</P>
<P>I believe the most important thing to &#8220;optimize&#8221; in spaced repetition practice is the emotional connection to your review sessions and their contents. It&#8217;s worth learning how to create prompts which effectively represent many different kinds of understanding, but a prompt isn&#8217;t worth reviewing just because it satisfies all the properties I&#8217;ve described here. If you find yourself reviewing something you don&#8217;t care about anymore, you should act. Sometimes upon reflection you&#8217;ll remember why you cared about the idea in the first place, and you can revise the prompt to cue that motivation. But most of the time the correct way to revise such prompts is to delete them.</P>
<P>Another way to approach this advice is to think about its reverse: what material <EM>should</EM> you write prompts about? When are these systems worth using? Many people feel paralyzed when getting started with spaced repetition, intrigued but unsure where it applies in their life. Others get started by trying to memorize trivia they feel they &#8220;should&#8221; know, like the names of all the U.S. presidents. Boredom and abandonment typically ensue. The best way to begin is to use these systems to help you do something that really matters to you&#8212;for example, as a lever to more deeply understand ideas connected to your core creative work. With time and experience, you&#8217;ll internalize the benefits and costs of spaced repetition, which may let you identify other useful applications (like I did with cooking). If you don&#8217;t see a way to use spaced repetition systems to help you do something that matters to you, then you probably shouldn&#8217;t bother using these systems at all.</P><ORBIT-REVIEWAREA><ORBIT-PROMPT question='What does Andy believe the most important thing to "optimize" in spaced repetition practice is?' answer="Your emotional connection to review sessions and their contents."></ORBIT-PROMPT><ORBIT-PROMPT question="What should you do if you find yourself reviewing something you don't care about anymore?" answer="Revise or delete the prompt."></ORBIT-PROMPT></ORBIT-REVIEWAREA>

<META content="Reviewing in Anki is easy:    all you have to do is answer the question    and press a button to indicate how well you remembered it.Creating the cards to review, however,    is a complex discipline of its own that&#8217;s both an art and a science,    and how well you do at designing your cards    can make the difference between        easy study sessions resulting in effective learning        and frustrating ones resulting in mediocre learning.Card design is thus the most fundamental skill of spaced-repetition use,    and it&#8217;s worth spending some time learning how to do it well." itemprop="description">

<P>Reviewing in Anki is easy: all you have to do is answer the question and press a button to indicate how well you remembered it. Creating the cards to review, however, is a complex discipline of its own that&#8217;s both an art and a science, and how well you do at designing your cards can make the difference between easy study sessions resulting in effective learning and frustrating ones resulting in mediocre learning. Card design is thus the most fundamental skill of spaced-repetition use, and it&#8217;s worth spending some time learning how to do it well.</P>
<P>Throughout the next couple of posts on creating cards for spaced-repetition systems, I&#8217;ll be frequently referencing SuperMemo&#8217;s <A href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge</FONT></A>. It would be hard to overstate the importance and influence of this document in the spaced-repetition community, and if you have not read it, you should do so now, or at least put it on your reading list. As a matter of fact, you should read it twice, consider memorizing the principles, and keep returning to and rereading it as you learn more about spaced repetition &#8211; it&#8217;s one of those resources you learn more from every time you read it.</P>
<H2 id=the-importance-of-asking-the-right-questions>The importance of asking the right questions</H2>
<P>An SRS does a fantastic job of helping you remember the information you put into it. However, it is a strongly garbage-in, garbage-out tool: if you put in material that isn&#8217;t useful or doesn&#8217;t test the things you want to know, you&#8217;ll remember it, but it won&#8217;t help you at all; you&#8217;ll just be wasting your time doing reviews. This poses a challenge for users, because seemingly small variations in how you ask a question can push it into not testing the thing you intended it to. The SRS is rather like the proverbial genie: describe what you want to get in the wrong way, and the genie will interpret your wish in the most ridiculous way possible and you&#8217;ll learn something that&#8217;s of no practical use. For instance, I recently found a card with an interval of several years in my own collection, asking what option to the <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</CODE> (copy) Unix command makes it ask for confirmation before overwriting existing files. I easily and correctly answered, &#8220;<CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp -i</CODE>,&#8221; but as I gave that answer, I realized that I had completely forgotten that <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</CODE> <EM>had</EM> such an option in the first place, so I would never have thought to use the option when it would have been useful, and this information was pretty much worthless to me. In other cases, you could end up memorizing a grammatical error on your card, or a learned response to a prompt which you would never encounter in real life.</P>
<P>To put it another way, SRS questions are prone to <EM>overfitting</EM>. <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting"><FONT color=#0066cc>Overfitting</FONT></A>, in statistical modeling and machine learning, occurs when a model gets &#8220;too good&#8221; at predicting the data you train it on &#8211; it starts to treat random noise present in the training data as a meaningful source of predictions. Of course, random noise does not represent any meaningful relationship that would be useful in predicting new information. Thus, overfitting improves the model&#8217;s accuracy rate on the training data but reduces it when it&#8217;s applied to new data, i.e., a real-world scenario. In a spaced-repetition context, because the SRS is so good at helping you learn things efficiently, it will optimize your memory of just about anything, but if you don&#8217;t phrase your question correctly, it will help you remember irrelevant information or random noise, rather than the information you actually wanted to know.</P>
<P>To avoid overfitting, the number-one rule when adding cards is this: every time you come across something you think you&#8217;d like to remember, <STRONG>identify exactly what you want to know</STRONG>, and be as precise about it as possible. Then, and only then, create one or more cards that ask about exactly that and nothing else. Doing this is more difficult and makes your initial learning process longer, compared to just dumping the information onto a flashcard, but it works much better! As a bonus, this process helps you understand and memorize the information, even before you start reviewing the cards: you&#8217;re forced to reflect on what exactly the information means to you, when you would need to use it, and how it relates to things you already know. This is an accidental form of the memory technique known as <EM>elaborative encoding</EM>, which has been consistently found to be one of the most effective ways to learn things &#8211; and you&#8217;re getting it for free while doing something you already needed to do to create your flashcards!</P>
<P>The remainder of this post will lay out some rules to help you ask the right questions on your cards. While I&#8217;ve made up one or two of the examples, the vast majority of them are real cards that came out of my personal collection today, just to demonstrate that most every spaced-repetition user has some of these skeletons in his closet (many of them are on my older cards, but several are much newer).</P>
<H2 id=questions-should-ask-exactly-one-thing>Questions should ask exactly one thing</H2>
<P>Rule #4 of the <A href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Twenty Rules</FONT></A> calls this the <EM>Minimum Information Principle</EM>: cards should never ask about more than one thing (techies might say that the card should be <EM>atomic</EM>). Violations of this rule may take obvious form, like literally asking two questions. However, most often they involve extremely general questions with a lot of content on the answer side:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: Give a description of the Python programming language.<BR>A: Python is a high-level, interpreted, multi-paradigm programming language written by Guido von Rossum and maintained by the Python Foundation. It is often used for system administration, data analysis, and rapid prototyping, and has been consistently named among the five most popular languages in recent years.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is a terrible card! Not that you shouldn&#8217;t want to know anything about Python, or that any of the information in it is explained poorly, but there is just far too much information. Unless you want to literally memorize the text of the answer by rote, you will never be able to correctly give all the information in it as an answer to that vague prompt. If you forget any part of the question, you&#8217;ll either have to fail it (thus dooming the card to come back practically every day since you can never satisfactorily learn all of it) or say you remembered it well when you didn&#8217;t. We could easily split this into a dozen questions, e.g.:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: Who designed the Python programming language?<BR>A: Guido von Rossum.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: What group maintains the Python programming language?<BR>A: The Python Foundation.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: Since 2015, Python has been ranked among the [&#8230;number] most popular programming languages.<BR>A: 5</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Et cetera.</P>
<P>It&#8217;s also worth pointing out there&#8217;s likely information in that initial &#8220;description&#8221; that we didn&#8217;t want to know in the first place and shouldn&#8217;t waste our time trying to learn. Splitting out what we&#8217;re learning into questions is a fantastic opportunity to decide what we need to remember so we can focus our efforts on the information that will be most valuable. Every piece of information you learn consumes study time that you could be using to learn other information. Choose wisely.</P>
<H2 id=questions-should-permit-exactly-one-answer>Questions should permit exactly one answer</H2>
<P>For efficient review, it must be immediately obvious both what is being asked and what single response will count as the correct answer; your thought process and your answer must be the same every time you review, in meaning if not in exact wording. This may seem straightforward, but most beginners frequently create cards that violate one or both of these rules. Heck, even experts do it from time to time. We can violate this rule in a wide variety of ways; let&#8217;s take a look at three common ones.</P>
<H3 id=allowing-correct-but-irrelevant-answers>Allowing correct but irrelevant answers</H3>
<P>Here&#8217;s a cloze deletion from my AP US History deck (9 years ago now!). In my notation for cloze deletions, the bit in {curly braces} shows up as a <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[...]</CODE> on the front of the card, asking you to fill in the blank; the whole sentence then shows up on the back.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Articles of Confederation had no power to regulate {commerce}.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is true, and an important point (the lack of regulation of commerce was an important problem that helped drive the creation of the U.S. Constitution, which followed the Articles). However, there are a practically infinite number of other correct answers we could give! The Articles of Confederation also had no power to regulate religious observances, taxation, bear hunting, the behavior of the British monarch, or the hours your neighbor can play the drums with her windows open. Obviously, some of these answers are more plausible than others, but the fact remains I could reasonably give an answer that was <EM>correct</EM> but not the answer on the back of the card.</P>
<P>If that happens during review, it&#8217;s unclear what I should do. I could fail the card, which seems wrong because I gave a correct answer. Or I could pass the card, which seems wrong because there&#8217;s no evidence that I remembered the piece of information I was trying to retain by making this card. Either way, I am not effectively reviewing the piece of information I set out to learn; I&#8217;m instead forcing myself to memorize, in addition to the actual answer, <EM>what this card is asking me</EM>. That means I&#8217;m effectively asking about two things and making it much harder to remember the card, for no benefit &#8211; in real life, knowing what one of my Anki cards was supposed to be asking is useless information.</P>
<P>The correct response, when you encounter this situation during review &#8211; and you will &#8211; is to stop reviewing for a moment and rewrite the card. We could do this in numerous ways, but here&#8217;s one possibility:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Economic and trade relations between states were difficult under the Articles of Confederation because the Articles granted no power to {regulate commerce}.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Of course, I could still come up with silly answers if I wanted to be contrary (I recommend being contrary &#8211; it&#8217;s fun). But, when reading the question in good faith, I can now be reasonably confident that if I don&#8217;t promptly remember the answer I intended, that means I&#8217;ve forgotten it.</P>
<H3 id=falling-into-the-example-trap>Falling into the &#8220;example&#8221; trap</H3>
<P>Beginners often write questions like this one:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: What&#8217;s an example of a non-combinatorial circuit?<BR>A: Memory.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is merely a special case of &#8220;allowing correct but irrelevant answers,&#8221; but I&#8217;ve seen it so frequently I want to call attention to it in particular. We have the same problem as before: not only do I have to remember that memory is a non-combinatorial circuit (the actual piece of information I wanted to know), I also have to remember that the specific example of a non-combinatorial circuit this card wants me to give is &#8220;memory&#8221;. An even worse version is &#8220;Give some examples of non-combinatorial circuits.&#8221; With this version, you can give different answers every time you see the card, including ones that aren&#8217;t on the card, and still have them be kind-of, sort-of, maybe correct!</P>
<P>Here&#8217;s another example. I perpetrated this one just a few days ago:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: OutSystems: Give an example of something you might use an input parameter for.<BR>A: In an edit screen, you would need to pass in the item to edit.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Fortunately, this question is trivial to recast into a useful form, once we&#8217;ve recognized that it&#8217;s problematic:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: OutSystems: How would you use an input parameter on an edit screen?<BR>A: To pass in the item you need to edit.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>However, the word <EM>example</EM> doesn&#8217;t in itself mean you&#8217;re doing something wrong; examples on your cards are fantastic when used correctly, like in the following question:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Asking why cats are unable to taste sweetness and humans are is an example of {functionalist} psychology.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Similarly, returning to the circuit question, we could write:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Memory is an example of a {non-combinatorial} circuit.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In essence, we&#8217;ve inverted the example. This kind of question is more targeted and easier to answer and also tends to be more useful knowledge. In the real world, we&#8217;re rarely called upon to offer examples of a textbook term, but we often benefit from being able to recognize that something is an example of that idea. And chances are, if you learn the idea well enough to easily answer questions of this form, you won&#8217;t have any trouble offering some examples of it if you need to.</P>
<P class=notice--info><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: The effectiveness of the two questions immediately above depends in great part on how complex your own taxonomy of those subjects is. Considering the memory question, I know relatively little about circuits, so I&#8217;m unlikely to get confused about what property of the memory circuit I&#8217;m being asked about. If I designed electronics for a living, on the other hand, I would likely need to rewrite that card with a hint or some additional context to be sure I knew which answer it was seeking. This is one of the many reasons that cards someone else makes will seldom be as effective as cards you make yourself: you&#8217;re the only one who knows what cues will get you the best results.</P>
<H3 id=allowing-multiple-interpretations-of-a-question>Allowing multiple interpretations of a question</H3>
<P>In this type of bad question, the creator didn&#8217;t clearly identify what they were trying to remember and consequently produced a vague question.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>APUSH: Americans moving to Texas [when it was under Mexican control] {did not adopt the ways of the region and remained Americans at heart}.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Is this the <EM>only</EM> thing I might have wanted to remember about Americans moving to Texas? Really? Now, no matter how bad this question is, I might be able to learn the answer (in fact, I have a nearly perfect, straight-3&#8217;s review history on this card), but the prompt is so vague that the only thing I&#8217;ve learned is &#8220;what to fill in the blank when I&#8217;m asked about Americans moving to Texas,&#8221; which is of little value in the real world.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: Why is the Earth&#8217;s rotation slowing down?<BR>A: Tidal deceleration.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This one&#8217;s a bit more subtle, but still problematic. The issue here is that the desired level of detail is unclear. Is it asking for the term that describes this phenomenon? (Is there even such a term? We wouldn&#8217;t know from the question.) Or did it want an explanation of the forces involved in tidal deceleration?</P>
<P>Here&#8217;s a better version:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: What gravitational effect is causing the Earth&#8217;s rotation to slow over time?<BR>A: Tidal deceleration.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If we didn&#8217;t know what tidal deceleration was, we&#8217;d also want to add a separate card, or maybe even several cards, explaining that process. That&#8217;s true even if we didn&#8217;t think we particularly wanted to know what tidal deceleration was. We don&#8217;t have a choice here: we <EM>have</EM> to know what tidal deceleration is for this card to be meaningful information. Even if we&#8217;re just trying to pass an exam which includes this exact question, the card will be much, much easier to remember when we know what it means. This is <A href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Rule #1</FONT></A>: <EM>Do not learn if you do not understand.</EM></P>
<P>Another important point is that having these cards may not remind us that Earth&#8217;s rotation <EM>is</EM> slowing down (see my anecdote about <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp -i</CODE> at the beginning of the post). Maybe we don&#8217;t care to recall that piece of information, and it would suffice to remember why it is, when we encounter a reference to the fact that it is. But if we do want to remember that it&#8217;s happening, we might also want to add a card to remind us, referencing the context in which we think we want to remember this information. For instance, maybe we care that the earth&#8217;s rotation is slowing down because it means <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second"><FONT color=#0066cc>leap seconds</FONT></A> are needed to keep our calendar in sync with the day/night cycle:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: Why are leap seconds periodically added to UTC time?<BR>A: Because the earth&#8217;s rotation is slowing over time, causing UTC to drift out of alignment with the sun.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In any case, as always, we have to take a moment to consider what we want to know in order to ask the right questions and get the information encoded in a useful way.</P>
<H2 id=questions-should-not-ask-you-to-enumerate-things>Questions should not ask you to enumerate things</H2>
<P>When you find a list of items in your reading, it&#8217;s often tempting to create a card asking what the members of the list are. Rules #9-10 of the <A href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Twenty Rules</FONT></A> call these <EM>sets</EM> (or <EM>enumerations</EM>, if they go in a specific order), and explain that they&#8217;re some of the most difficult and frustrating cards, so we want to avoid them when possible.</P>
<P>Usually people create sets because they don&#8217;t realize sets are problematic or because they seem like the most obvious thing to learn, rather than because the set is actually what they want to know. In fact, being able to name all examples or parts of something is rarely helpful. A nasty illusion may make it appear to be, however. Consider the internal combustion engine, a classic example of a complex machine in many ways defined by its many parts. Someone who can name all the parts of the ICE will seem to have a good understanding of it. But this is an effect, rather than a cause. If you can name all the parts of the ICE but don&#8217;t know what they do, you still understand nothing at all about how it works. In contrast, if you know what all the parts do and how they relate to each other, you will easily be able to visualize the engine layout or work your way through the parts by function and name and describe each of them, regardless of whether you sat down and learned to recite them in order.</P>
<P>Of course, once in a while it really is helpful to know a set of things. In this case, you can improve your performance markedly by (a) learning and fully understanding each individual member of the set through separate cards; and (b) ordering the set into an enumeration and developing a mnemonic device such as an acronym for the order. (I like to keep close to the minimum information principle by creating two cards for part (b), one asking what my mnemonic is and the other asking me to use the mnemonic to produce the answer.) The <A href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Twenty Rules</FONT></A> has a good example of using this approach to learn the countries in the EU (rule #9), although it doesn&#8217;t include a mnemonic. But before you learn a set, even in an effective way, spend some time reflecting on whether it&#8217;s truly helpful.</P>
<P>Memorizing verbatim texts like poems or speeches is a special case of enumerations. In this case, overlapping cloze deletions are helpful, testing one line per card in a way that leads you to eventually recite every line in its context. My popular Anki add-on <A href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2084557901"><FONT color=#0066cc>LPCG</FONT></A> (Lyrics/Poetry Cloze Generator) can help you create cards from such texts.</P>
<H2 id=questions-should-not-ask-for-yes-or-no-answers>Questions should not ask for yes or no answers</H2>
<P>Perhaps curiously, I find that questions whose answer is &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; are harder to remember than questions that contain more information. They also tend to be less useful. If you create and learn cards that ask deeper questions, you&#8217;ll likely still be able to give the correct &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; but also know additional information about why this is the case.</P>
<P>Here&#8217;s an example from my computer-hardware-design deck:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: Is segmentation used on modern processors?<BR>A: No, it was removed in the x86-64 platform.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Interestingly, you can see that I actually included the information needed to produce a better question in the answer. The answer is a terrible place for this kind of information, though: you&#8217;re never asked to actively recall it and you look at it for a fraction of the time you look at the question, so you&#8217;re unlikely to ever memorize it. Instead, we can rewrite the card:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Segmentation was common on older processors but was removed starting with the {x86-64} platform.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Notice that by learning this fact (in which processor platform was segmentation removed?), we are still aware that segmentation is no longer used in the most modern processors, but we also know exactly when it was removed and what sorts of processors we might expect to find it in (provided we know something about processors, which I don&#8217;t expect you to!).</P>
<P>We might also consider creating a card, in addition to or instead of the above card, asking <EM>why</EM> segmentation was removed in the x86-64 platform. It all depends on what exactly we want to know, but <EM>why</EM> questions are usually valuable additions.</P>
<P>All this said, I do still find myself writing yes/no questions on occasion, especially when I&#8217;m in the early stages of learning a topic. Sometimes you don&#8217;t know the <EM>why</EM> yet, and it&#8217;s better at the moment that you simply learn that something is or isn&#8217;t, rather than go look up and learn a bunch of details just to be able to improve one flashcard. Perhaps later, you&#8217;ll have the additional understanding to rewrite the card.</P>
<P>That brings up an important point: questions are not set in stone. You&#8217;ll often miss potential problems with your new questions until you start reviewing them, and still other times you&#8217;ll learn a card and realize weeks or months later after reading a completely different resource that you were missing some important context or your initial understanding was flat-out wrong. You should make liberal use of the edit button while reviewing (in Anki, press <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</CODE> to edit the current card, and Escape when you&#8217;re done). If you spot a problem with a card that you can&#8217;t fix right away &#8211; maybe you&#8217;re reviewing on your phone and you need to look something up in a book at home to fix it up &#8211; use the &#8220;mark&#8221; function, which will add the tag &#8220;marked&#8221; to your card. When you have a few free moments, and before you forget what the problem was &#8211; I like to do this once a week or so &#8211; search for <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tag:marked</CODE> in the browser and edit the cards appropriately, then unmark them again.</P>
<H2 id=questions-should-be-context-free>Questions should be context-free</H2>
<P><EM>Context-free</EM> here is meant in the sense of a <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar"><FONT color=#0066cc>context-free grammar</FONT></A>, that is, a grammar within which the correct interpretation of any statement is independent of its surroundings. Your questions, in other words, should be 100% comprehensible without any surrounding context; if you were to find one written on a slip of paper that somebody dropped in the street, you should be able to understand exactly what the question is asking. This design imperative takes two main forms.</P>
<P><STRONG>(1) The topic or context should be stated at the beginning or near the beginning of the question,</STRONG> to prime your memory to retrieve the right kind of information and to facilitate reviewing cards from different subjects intermixed, which many people believe improves creativity. For instance, in several of my questions above, you saw qualifiers at the start of the question like <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OutSystems:</CODE> or <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">APUSH:</CODE>. A word describing the topic worked into the sentence can work, too, although <A href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Rule #16</FONT></A> does recommend prefixes so you can be sure your brain gets started correctly.</P>
<P>If you don&#8217;t do this, you will often find yourself interpreting the question incorrectly &#8211; even if the question was clear in the context in which you were writing it, when you see it in the context of your reviews, it may not be so obvious. In fact, even if you <EM>don&#8217;t</EM> intermix questions from different disciplines, it&#8217;s possible to get confused. For example, I&#8217;ve long since lost count of the number of times I&#8217;ve given an answer in Latin to a card asking about German or English or my shorthand language, even when my last 30 cards had been in German!</P>
<P>My collection is full of thousands of cards that don&#8217;t have good context cues, and it will likely be years before I notice and fix all of the problem ones. Do yourself a favor and get in the habit right away. Even if you&#8217;re only studying, say, organic chemistry right now, ensure your questions can be comprehended within the context of a broader body of knowledge.</P>
<P><STRONG>(2) The question should not be built around a particular source.</STRONG> It&#8217;s okay to <EM>cite</EM> your sources on your cards (actually, it&#8217;s a fantastic idea to reference sources in one way or another, because sooner or later you&#8217;re going to have doubts about the veracity of some card, or simply want to find more information about the topic). However, questions like this one are to be avoided:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Statistics: One of the major focuses of our book&#8217;s introduction is that it is useful to measure {what you don&#8217;t know, or the uncertainty you have}.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>First of all, this violates principle 1, since it just refers to &#8220;our book.&#8221; I happen to know which textbook it refers to at the moment, but at a different time I might not! But as for principle 2, I will never go, &#8220;Hey, what did the introduction of that statistics textbook I used my junior year of college focus on?&#8221; The premise of this question &#8211; describing what the textbook says &#8211; simply is not useful, and the information I&#8217;m learning from this card won&#8217;t be relevant in real life.</P>
<P>Hopefully, having read this article through this far, you&#8217;ve started to internalize the &#8220;What do I want to know?&#8221; mindset and this question just looks bad to you. I know it does to me.</P>
<P>Not to leave an exercise for the reader, how about this version:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Statistics is not only about describing what you know but also about putting it in the context of {what you still don&#8217;t know}.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Be careful not to confuse this prohibition with a very useful pattern, namely that of asking what particular authors think about a topic, or qualifying information by saying that so-and-so said it. This other pattern uses the source information entirely differently: rather than making the question <EM>about</EM> the author&#8217;s book, it asks about the idea <EM>in</EM> the book while explaining where it came from. For example:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: Why, according to Cal Newport, are discoveries often made by multiple people at the same time?<BR>A: These things are part of the &#8220;adjacent possible&#8221; and were thus particularly easy to discover.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This becomes an especially valuable pattern once you get past the basic textbook knowledge and how-to rules in a field, where agreement can no longer be taken for granted. You don&#8217;t want to memorize opinions or nascent theories as facts!</P>
<H2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</H2>
<P>I hope these rules are helpful to you. Most spaced-repetition beginners vastly underestimate the importance of carefully worded questions, and I have yet to see anybody write about common issues in this level of detail. The rules are drawn from my own experience, but I&#8217;m the first to admit that I don&#8217;t know everything about writing cards; if anything, the longer I spend studying, the more things I realize I don&#8217;t understand! I would be interested to know if others have different experiences or have identified additional rules in the same vein.</P>
<P>Of course, rules are made to be broken, especially once you gain more experience, but if you start out by seeking to follow these, you&#8217;ll be kept out of many common traps that make spaced repetition less effective than it could or should be for many.</P></SECTION><FOOTER class=page__meta>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>The way we formulate knowledge in learning has a monumental impact on memory. Well-phrased questions make learning easy. Well-structured knowledge will help keep it in memory for life.
</p><p><b><a class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">Effective learning: 20 rules of knowledge formulation</a></b>, compiled in 1999, describes the most important rules needed to effectively formulate good questions for long-term <a title="Retention" class="mw-redirect" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retention">retention</a>. Below I provide a concise executive summary (esp. for those interested in <a title="Incremental reading" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>).
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary:_20_rules">Summary: 20 rules</span></h2>
<ul><li><a title="Do not memorize before you understand" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Do_not_memorize_before_you_understand">don't learn things that you do not understand</a></li>
<li>learn before you memorize</li>
<li>start from basics before going into complexities</li>
<li><a title="Simple questions in spaced repetition" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple_questions_in_spaced_repetition">keep questions simple</a></li>
<li>pictures assist memory</li>
<li>learn mnemonic techniques, e.g. peg lists</li>
<li>avoid lists, sets and enumerations (they can be tackled with <a title="Cloze deletion" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> as in the <a class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ktH-TceHx8">video</a>)</li>
<li>personalize and provide examples</li>
<li><a title="Cloze deletion" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> is fast and has a great <a title="Mnemonic anchor" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mnemonic_anchor">mnemonic power</a></li>
<li>use <a title="Redundancy" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Redundancy">redundancy</a> (similar <a title="Item" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item">items</a> asking similar questions from different angles)</li>
<li>use <a class="external text" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">references</a></li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="New_rules:_incremental_reading">New rules: incremental reading</span></h2>
<p>With the advent of <a title="Incremental reading" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, the rules have been modified, and re-prioritized.
</p><p>Changes of formulation strategy in <a title="Incremental reading" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>:
</p>
<ul><li>building comprehension may be part of the learning process, and creating <a title="Cloze deletion" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> on poorly understood phrases is acceptable</li>
<li>learning and memorization may occur in parallel (see: <a class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/XRuLV2_A3Ts">video</a>)</li>
<li>early in the learning process, <a title="Item" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item">items</a> may be <a title="Complexity" class="mw-redirect" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Complexity">complex</a>. They <a title="Simple questions in spaced repetition" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple_questions_in_spaced_repetition">get simplified incrementally</a> depending on <a title="Priority queue" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Priority_queue">knowledge priority</a>, and the available time</li>
<li>multiple <a title="Cloze deletion" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> on different formulations of the same statement may often substitute for mnemonic techniques (see: <a title="Knowledge darwinism" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_darwinism">Knowledge darwinism</a>)</li>
<li>lists, sets, and enumerations can be easily tackled with <a title="Cloze deletion" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> (see: <a class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/AmpdWZEAX3Q">video</a>)</li>
<li>for personalization, add your own stories to texts that you learn. <a title="Incremental writing" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_writing">Elaborate creatively</a></li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Meta_rule:_Pleasure_of_learning">Meta rule: Pleasure of learning</span></h2>
<p>A simple and universal litmus test for a good formulation is <a title="Pleasure of learning" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning">pleasure of learning</a>. Each time you see a drop in pleasure, come back to this text and see if you can find a rule violation that might be responsible for the decline in fun.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Meta_rule:_Applicability">Meta rule: Applicability</span></h2>
<p>We should strive at maximum <a title="Applicability" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability">applicability</a> of knowledge.
</p><p><a title="Simple formula for high intelligence" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple_formula_for_high_intelligence">Human intelligence</a> is based on knowledge, of which <b><a title="Abstract knowledge" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge">abstract knowledge</a></b> plays a particularly important role. Abstract knowledge is based on rules, such as 2+2=4. Such rules may be employed in multiple contexts and contribute to problem solving capacity. Rules are more useful than facts. For example, it is more useful to know that 2+2=4 (rule) than to know that a friends's phone number beings with <i>4</i> (fact). Rules and formulas are more <a title="Applicability" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability">applicable</a> than facts. For more details see: <a title="Abstract knowledge" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge">Abstract knowledge</a>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Meta_rule:_Simplicity">Meta rule: Simplicity</span></h2>
<p>In representing knowledge, we should always strive at formulating <b><a title="Complexity" class="mw-redirect" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Complexity">atomic memories</a></b> set in a good context of comprehension. If learning is enjoyable, <a title="Item" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item">items</a> are probably formulated pretty well. The picture explains why simple memories are easier to <a title="Retention" class="mw-redirect" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retention">retain</a>:
</p>
<figure class="mw-halign-center" typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><a class="mw-file-description" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Memory_complexity.png"><img width="600" height="520" src="https://supermemo.guru/images/thumb/f/f5/Memory_complexity.png/600px-Memory_complexity.png" srcset="/images/thumb/f/f5/Memory_complexity.png/900px-Memory_complexity.png 1.5x, /images/f/f5/Memory_complexity.png 2x" decoding="async"></a><figcaption>Memory complexity: simple and complex memories</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote><p><i><b>Figure:</b> <b><a title="Memory complexity" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_complexity">Memory complexity</a></b> illustrates the importance of the <a title="Minimum information principle" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Minimum_information_principle">minimum information principle</a>. When memorizing simple questions and answers, we can rely on a simple memory connection, and uniformly refresh that connection at review. Complex memories may have their concepts activated in an incomplete fashion, or in a different sequence that depends on the context. As a result, it is hard to produce a uniform increase in <a title="Memory stability" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_stability">memory stability</a> at review. Complex items are difficult to remember. An example of a simple item may be a word pair, e.g. </i>apple = pomo<i> (Esperanto). While a complex net of connection may be needed to recognize an apple. The connection between </i>apple<i> and </i>pomo<i> is irreducible (i.e. maximally simplified)</i></p></blockquote>

<TD bgColor=#ffffbb>This article will help you overcome one of the greatest difficulties you will face when trying to accelerate learning: <STRONG>formulating knowledge</STRONG></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The speed of learning will depend on the way you formulate the material. The same material can be learned many times faster if well formulated! The difference in speed can be stunning!</P>
<P>The rules are listed in the order of importance. Those listed first are most often violated or bring most benefit when complied with!</P>
<P>There is an underlying assumption that you will proceed with learning using spaced repetition, i.e. you will not just learn once but you will repeat the material optimally (as in <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>SuperMemo</FONT></A>).</P>
<H3>The 20 rules of formulating knowledge in learning</H3>
<OL>
<LI>
<H4><A name="Do not learn if you do not understand">Do not learn if you do not understand</A></H4>
<P>Trying to learn things you do not understand may seem like an utmost waste of time. Still, an amazing proportion of students commit the offence of learning without comprehension. Very often they have no other choice! The quality of many textbooks or lecture scripts is deplorable while examination deadlines are unmovable.</P>
<P>If you are not a speaker of German, it is still possible to learn a history textbook in German. The book can be crammed word for word. However, the time needed for such "blind learning" is astronomical. Even more important: The value of such knowledge is negligible. If you cram a German book on history, you will still know nothing of history.</P>
<P>The German history book example is an extreme. However, the materials you learn may often seem well structured and you may tend to blame yourself for lack of comprehension. Soon you may pollute your learning process with a great deal of useless material that treacherously makes you believe "it will be useful some day".</P></LI>
<LI>
<H4><A name="Learn before you memorize">Learn before you memorize</A></H4>
<P>Before you proceed with memorizing individual facts and rules, you need to <STRONG>build an overall picture of the learned knowledge</STRONG>. Only when individual pieces fit to build a single coherent structure will you be able to dramatically reduce the learning time. This is closely related to the problem of comprehension mentioned in <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Do not learn if you do not understand"><FONT color=#0066cc>Rule 1: Do not learn if you do not understand</FONT></A>. A single separated piece of your big picture is like a single German word in the textbook of history.</P>
<P>Do not start from memorizing loosely related facts! First read a chapter in your book that puts them together (e.g. <EM>the principles of the internal combustion engine</EM>). Only then proceed with learning using individual questions and answers (e.g. <EM>What moves the pistons in the internal combustion engine?</EM>), etc.</P></LI>
<LI>
<H4><A name="Build upon the basics">Build upon the basics</A></H4>
<P>The picture of the learned whole (as discussed in <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Learn before you memorize"><FONT color=#0066cc>Rule 2: Learn before you memorize</FONT></A>) does not have to be complete to the last detail. Just the opposite, the simpler the picture the better. The shorter the initial chapter of your book the better. Simple models are easier to comprehend. You can always build upon them later on.</P>
<P>Do not neglect the basics. Memorizing seemingly obvious things is not a waste of time! Basics may also appear volatile and the cost of memorizing easy things is little. Better err on the safe side. Remember that usually <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/theory.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>you spend 50% of your time repeating just 3-5% of the learned material</FONT></A>! Basics are usually easy to retain and take a tiny proportion of your time. However, each memory lapse on a basic fact can be very costly!</P></LI>
<LI>
<H4>Stick to the <A name="minimum information principle">minimum information principle</A></H4>
<P>The material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is only possible. Simplicity does not have to imply losing information and skipping the difficult part. Simplicity is imperative due to the way the brain works. There are two main reasons for which knowledge must be simple:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P><STRONG>Simple is easy</STRONG></P>
<P>By definition, simple material is easy to remember. This comes from the fact that its simplicity makes is easy for the brain to process in always it the same way. Imagine a labyrinth. When making a repetition of a piece of material, your brain is running through a labyrinth (you can view a neural network as a tangle of paths). While running through the labyrinth, the brain leaves a track on the walls. If it can run in only one unique way, the path is continuous and easy to follow. If there are many combinations, each run may leave a different trace that will interfere with other traces making it difficult to find the exit. The same happens on the cellular level with different synaptic connections being activated at each repetition of complex material.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P><STRONG>Repetitions of simple items are easier to schedule</STRONG></P>
<P>I assume you will make repetitions of the learned material using optimum inter-repetition intervals (as in <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>SuperMemo</FONT></A>). If you consider an item that is composed of two sub-items, you will need to make repetitions that are frequent enough to <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/stability.htm#stability_of_complex_items"><FONT color=#0066cc>keep the more difficult item in memory</FONT></A>. If you split the complex item into sub-items, each can be repeated at its own pace saving your time. Very often, inexperienced students create items that could easily be split into <STRONG>ten or more</STRONG> simpler sub-items! Although the number of items increases, the number of repetitions of each item will usually be small enough to greatly outweigh the cost of (1) forgetting the complex item again and again, (2) repeating it in excessively short intervals or (3) actually remembering it only in part!</P></LI></UL>
<P>Here is a striking example:</P>
<TABLE cellPadding=10 bgColor=#c0c0c0 border=2>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TH bgColor=#ff0000>Ill-formulated knowledge - Complex and wordy</TH></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Q: What are the characteristics of the Dead Sea?<BR>A: Salt lake located on the border between Israel and Jordan. Its shoreline is the lowest point on the Earth's surface, averaging 396 m below sea level. It is 74 km long. It is seven times as salty (30% by volume) as the ocean. Its density keeps swimmers afloat. Only simple organisms can live in its saline waters </P></TD></TR>

<P>Q: Where is the Dead Sea located?<BR>A: <STRONG>on the border between Israel and Jordan</STRONG> </P>
<P>Q: What is the lowest point on the Earth's surface?<BR>A: <STRONG>The Dead Sea shoreline</STRONG> </P>
<P>Q: What is the average level on which the Dead Sea is located?<BR>A: <STRONG>400 meters</STRONG> (below sea level) </P>
<P>Q: How long is the Dead Sea?<BR>A: <STRONG>70 km</STRONG> </P>
<P>Q: How much saltier is the Dead Sea as compared with the oceans?<BR>A: <STRONG>7 times</STRONG> </P>
<P>Q: What is the volume content of salt in the Dead Sea?<BR>A: <STRONG>30%</STRONG> </P>
<P>Q: Why can the Dead Sea keep swimmers afloat?<BR>A: <STRONG>due to high salt content</STRONG> </P>
<P>Q: Why is the Dead Sea called Dead?<BR>A: <STRONG>because only simple organisms can live in it</STRONG> </P>
<P>Q: Why only simple organisms can live in the Dead Sea?<BR>A: <STRONG>because of high salt content</STRONG> </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>You might want to experiment and try to learn two subjects using the two above approaches and see for yourself what advantage is brought by minimum information principle. This is particularly visible in the long perspective, i.e. <STRONG>the longer the time you need to remember knowledge, the more you benefit from simplifying your items</STRONG>!</P>
<P>Note in the example above how short the questions are. Note also that the answers are even shorter! We want a minimum amount of information to be retrieved from memory in a single repetition! <STRONG>We want answer to be as short as imaginably possible</STRONG>!</P>
<P>You will notice that the knowledge learned in the ill-structured example is not entirely equivalent to the well-structured formulation. For example, although you will remember why the Dead Sea can keep swimmers afloat, you may forget that it at all has such a characteristic in the first place! Additionally, rounding 396 to 400 and 74 to 70 produces some loss of information. These can be remedied by adding more questions or making the present ones more precise.</P>
<P>You will also lose the ability to fluently recite the description of the Dead Sea when called up to the blackboard by your teachers. I bet, however, that shining in front of the class is not your ultimate goal in learning. To see how to cope with recitations and poems, read further (section devoted to <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Enumerations"><FONT color=#0066cc>enumerations</FONT></A>)</P></LI>

<H4><A name="Cloze deletion"><FONTX size="4">Cloze deletion</FONTX></A> is easy and effective</H4>
<P><EM>Cloze deletion</EM> is a sentence with its parts missing and replaced by three dots. <EM>Cloze deletion exercise</EM> is an exercise that uses cloze deletion to ask the student to fill in the gaps marked with the three dots.

<P>If you are a beginner and if you find it difficult to stick to the minimum information principle, use cloze deletion! If you are an advanced user, you will also like cloze deletion. It is a quick and effective method of converting textbook knowledge into knowledge that can be subject to learning based on spaced repetition.

<H4><A name="Use imagery">Use imagery</A></H4>
<P>Visual cortex is that part of the brain in which visual stimuli are interpreted. It has been very well developed in the course of evolution and that is why we say <EM>one picture is worth a thousand words</EM>. Indeed if you look at the number of details kept in a picture and the easiness with which your memory can retain them, you will notice that our verbal processing power is greatly inferior as compared with the visual processing power. The same refers to memory. A graphic representation of information is usually far less volatile. </P>
<P>Usually it takes much less time to formulate a simple question-and-answer pair than to find or produce a neat graphic image. This is why you will probably always have to weigh up cost and profits in using graphics in your learning material. Well-employed images will greatly reduce your learning time in areas such as anatomy, geography, geometry, chemistry, history, and many more.</P>
<P>The power of imagery explains why the concept of Tony Buzan's mind maps is so popular. A mind map is an abstract picture in which connections between its components reflect the logical connections between individual concepts.</P>

<H4>Use <A name="mnemonic techniques">mnemonic techniques</A></H4>
<P>Mnemonic techniques are various techniques that make remembering easier. They are often amazingly effective. For most students, a picture of a 10-year-old memorizing a sequence of 50 playing cards verges on discovering a young genius. It is very surprising then to find out how easy it is to learn the techniques that make it possible with a dose of training. These techniques are available to everyone and do not require any special skills!</P>
<P>Before you start believing that mastering such techniques will provide you with an eternal solution to the problem of forgetting, be warned that the true bottleneck towards long-lasting and useful memories is not in quickly memorizing knowledge! This is indeed the easier part. The bottleneck lies in retaining memories for months, years or for lifetime! To accomplish the latter you will need <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>SuperMemo</FONT></A> and the compliance with the 20 rules presented herein.</P>
<P>There have been dozens of books written about mnemonic techniques. Probably those written by Tony Buzan are most popular and respected. You can search the web for keywords such as: <EM>mind maps</EM>, <EM>peg lists</EM>, <EM>mnemonic techniques</EM>, etc.</P>
<P>Experience shows that with a dose of training you will need to consciously apply mnemonic techniques in only 1-5% of your items. With time, using mnemonic techniques will become automatic!</P>

<H4><A name="Graphic deletion">Graphic deletion</A> is as good as cloze deletion</H4>
<P>Graphic deletion works like <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Cloze deletion"><FONT color=#0066cc>cloze deletion</FONT></A> but instead of a missing phrase it uses a missing image component. For example, when learning anatomy, you might present a complex illustration. Only a small part of it would be missing. The student's job is to name the missing area. The same illustration can be used to formulate 10-20 items! Each item can ask about a specific subcomponent of the image. Graphic deletion works great in learning geography!</P>

<P>Note that you could also paint covering rectangles or circles on the original image but this would greatly increase the size of your collection. The above method makes sure that you reuse the same image many times in all items of the same template.

<H4><A name="Avoid sets">Avoid sets</A></H4>
<P>A <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set"><FONT color=#0066cc>set</FONT></A> is a collection of objects. For example, a set of fruits might be an apple, a pear and a peach. A classic example of an item that is difficult to learn is an item that asks for the list of the members of a set. For example: <EM>What countries belong to the European Union?</EM> You should avoid such items whenever possible due to the high cost of retaining memories based on sets. If sets are absolutely necessary, you should always try to convert them into <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Enumerations"><FONT color=#0066cc>enumerations</FONT></A>. Enumerations are ordered lists of members (for example, the alphabetical list of the members of the EU). Enumerations are also hard to remember and should be avoided. However, the great advantage of enumerations over sets is that they are ordered and they force the brain to list them always in the same order. An ordered list of countries contains more information than the set of countries that can be listed in any order. Paradoxically, despite containing more information, enumerations are easier to remember. The reason for this has been discussed earlier in the context of the <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#minimum information principle"><FONT color=#0066cc>minimum information principle</FONT></A>: <STRONG>you should always try to make sure your brain works in the exactly same way at each repetition</STRONG>. In the case of sets, listing members in varying order at each repetition has a disastrous effect on memory. It is nearly impossible to memorize sets containing more than five members without the use of mnemonic techniques, enumeration, grouping, etc. Despite this claim, you will often succeed due to subconsciously mastered techniques that help you go around this problem. Those techniques, however, will fail you all too often. For that reason: <STRONG>Avoid sets!</STRONG> If you need them badly, convert them into enumerations and use <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Enumerations"><FONT color=#0066cc>techniques for dealing with enumerations</FONT></A></P>

<P>Note that in the example above, we converted a 15-member set into 9 items, five of which are 2-3 member sets, and one is a six member enumeration. Put it to your SuperMemo, and see how easy it is to generate the list of the European Union members using the historic timeline! Note the tricks used with France and the UK. They joined the union in the company of others but have been listed as separate items to simplify the learning process. Note also that the sum of information included in this well-formulated approach is far greater than that of the original set. Thus along simplicity, we gained some useful knowledge. All individual items effectively comply with the <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#minimum information principle"><FONT color=#0066cc>minimum information principle</FONT></A>! You could go further by trying to split the Germany-Italy-Benelux set or using mnemonic techniques to memorize the final seven-member enumeration (i.e. the last of the questions above). However, you should take those steps only if you have any problems with retaining the proposed set in memory.</P></LI>

<H4><A name=Enumerations>Avoid enumerations</A></H4>
<P>Enumerations are also an example of classic items that are hard to learn. They are still far more acceptable than sets. Avoid enumerations wherever you can. If you cannot avoid them, deal with them using <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Cloze deletion"><FONT color=#0066cc>cloze deletions</FONT></A> (overlapping cloze deletions if possible). Learning the alphabet can be a good example of an overlapping cloze deletion:</P>

<P>The above items will make learning the alphabet much faster. The greatest advantage of the above approach is that is it easier for psychological reasons: the student does not have to stop repetitions to recite the whole sequence and can only focus on a small part of the learned material. Still it is recommended that he recite the whole alphabet <STRONG>after</STRONG> making the repetition. However, once all individual pieces are well remembered, reciting the whole should be a pleasant and speedy action that produces little frustration.<BR>The cloze deletion used above is an overlapping cloze deletion, i.e. the same parts of the enumeration are strengthened in memory using different items (for example, the sequence C-D will be needed to recall the second and the third item). This redundancy does not contradict the <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#minimum information principle"><FONT color=#0066cc>minimum information principle</FONT></A> because <STRONG>the extra information is added in extra items</STRONG>.</P>
<P>You can also deal with enumerations by using grouping like in the case of sets (see the <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#EEC"><FONT color=#0066cc>European Union example</FONT></A>) but cloze deletions should be simpler and should suffice in most cases.<BR>Learning poems is an example of learning enumerations (all words and sentences have to be uttered in a predefined sequence); however, due to strong semantic connections, the rhyme and the rhythm, it may often be possible to effectively remember poems without using cloze deletion and without the frustration of forgetting small subcomponents again and again. However, once you notice you stumble with your poem, you should dismember it using cloze deletion and thus make sure that the learning is fast, easy, effective and pleasurable</P>

<H4>Combat <A name=Interference>interference</A></H4>
<P>When you learn about similar things you often confuse them. For example, you may have problems distinguishing between the meanings of the words <EM>historic</EM> and <EM>historical</EM>. This will even be more visible if you memorize lots of numbers, e.g. optimum dosages of drugs in pharmacotherapy. If knowledge of one item makes it harder to remember another item, we have a case of <STRONG>memory interference</STRONG>. You can often remember an item for years with straight excellent grades until ... you memorize another item that makes it nearly impossible to remember either! For example, if you learn geography and you memorize that the country located between Venezuela, Suriname and Brazil is Guyana, you are likely to easily recall this fact for years with just a couple of repetitions. However, once you add similar items asking about the location of all these countries, and French Guyana, and Colombia and more, you will suddenly notice strong memory interference and you may experience unexpected forgetting. In simple terms: you will get confused about what is what.</P>
<P>Interference is probably the single greatest cause of forgetting in collections of an experienced user of SuperMemo. You can never be sure when it strikes, and the only hermetic procedure against it is to <STRONG>detect and eliminate</STRONG>. In other words, in many cases it may be impossible to predict interference at the moment of formulating knowledge. Interference can also occur between remotely related items like Guyana, Guyard and Guyenne, as well as Guyana, kayman and ... aspirin. It may work differently for you and for your colleague. It is very hard to predict.</P>
<P>Still you should do your best to prevent interference before it takes its toll. This will make your learning process less stressful and mentally bearable. Here are some tips:

Otherwise the redundant information will only slow down your learning process!</P></LI>

<H4><A name="Refer to other memories">Refer to other memories</A></H4>
<P>Referring to other memories can place your item in a better context, simplify wording, and reduce interference.

Your items may assume bizarre form; however, as long as they are produced for your private consumption, the end justifies the means. Use objects that evoke very specific and strong emotions: love, sex, war, your late relative, object of your infatuation, Linda Tripp, Nelson Mandela, etc. It is well known that emotional states can facilitate recall; however, you should make sure that you are not deprived of the said emotional clues at the moment when you need to retrieve a given memory in a real-life situation</P>

<P>If you have vivid and positive memories related to the meetings between Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk, you are likely to quickly grasp the meaning of the definition of banter. Without the example you might struggle with interference from words such as <EM>badinage</EM> or even <EM>chat</EM>. There is no risk of irrelevant emotional state in this example as the state helps to define the semantics of the learned concept! A well-thought example can often reduce your learning time several times! I have recorded examples in which an item without an example was forgotten 20 times within one year, while the same item with a subtle interference-busting example was not forgotten even once in ten repetitions spread over five years. This is roughly equivalent to <STRONG>25-fold saving in time in the period of 20 years</STRONG>! Such examples are not rare!

This will help you simplify the wording of your items as you will be relieved from the need to specify the context of your question. In the example below, the well-defined prefix <EM>bioch:</EM> saves you a lot of typing and a lot of reading while still making sure you do not confuse the abbreviation GRE with Graduate Record Examination. Note that in the recommended case, you process the item starting from the label <EM>bioch</EM> which puts your brain immediately in the right context. While processing the lesser optimum case, you will waste precious milliseconds on flashing the standard meaning of GRE and ... what is worse ... you will light up the wrong areas of your brain that will now perhaps be prone to interference!</P>

<LI><STRONG>passive and active approach</STRONG>: if you learn a foreign language, e.g. Esperanto, you will often build word pairs such as <EM>phone-telefono</EM>, <EM>language-lingvo</EM>, <EM>hope-esperanto</EM>, etc. These pairs require active recall of the foreign word. Active recall does not, however, guarantee passive recognition and you may fail with <EM>telefono-phone</EM>, <EM>lingvo-language</EM>, or <EM>esperanto-hope</EM>. Adding new elements with swapped questions and answers may in some cases be redundant but it does not contradict the minimum information principle! Your items are still as simple as possible.

<LI><STRONG>reasoning cues</STRONG>: you will often want to boost your reasoning ability by asking about a solution to the problem. Instead of just <EM>memorizing</EM> the answer you would like to quickly follow the reasoning steps (e.g. solve a simple mathematical equation) and <EM>generate</EM> the answer. In such a case, providing the hint on the reasoning steps in the answer will only serve helping you always follow the right path at repetitions</LI>
<LI><STRONG>derivation steps</STRONG>: in more complex problems to solve, memorizing individual derivation steps is always highly recommended (e.g. solving complex mathematical problems). It is not cramming! It is making sure that the brain can always follow the fastest path while solving the problem. For more on boosting creativity and intelligence read: <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Roots of genius and creativity</FONT></A>, as well as more specific: <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/ol/ks.htm#Intelligence"><FONT color=#0066cc>Derivation, reasoning and intelligence</FONT></A></LI>
<LI><STRONG>multiple semantic representation</STRONG>: very often the same knowledge can be represented and viewed from different angles. Memorizing different representations of the same fact or rule is recommended in cases where a given memory is of high value. This will increase the expected recall rate (beyond that specified with the <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/fi.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>forgetting index</FONT></A>)!</LI>
<LI><STRONG>flexible repetition</STRONG>: if there are many valid responses to the same question make sure that your representation makes it possible to identify the equivalence and reward you with good grades by providing just one of the equivalent choices. For example, if you learn a language, it rarely make sense to learn all synonyms that meet a definition of a concept. It is more adequate to consider a single synonym as the sufficient answer (e.g. <EM>a mark made by ink spilt on sth</EM> = <EM>blot/blob/blotch</EM>)</LI>

<H4>Provide <A name=sources>sources</A></H4>
<P>Except for well-tested and proven knowledge (such as <EM>2+2=4</EM>), it is highly recommended that you include sources from which you have gathered your knowledge. In real-life situation you will often be confronted with challenges to your knowledge. Sources can come to your rescue. You will also find that facts and figures differ depending on the source. You can really be surprised how frivolously reputable information agencies publish figures that are drastically different from other equally reputable sources. Without SuperMemo, those discrepancies are often difficult to notice: before you encounter the new fact, the old one is often long forgotten. With sources provided, you will be able to make more educated choices on which pieces of information are more reliable. Adding reliability labels may also be helpful (e.g. <EM>Watch out!, Other sources differ!</EM>, etc.). Sources should accompany your items but should not be part of the learned knowledge (unless it is critical for you to be able to recall the source whenever asked).</P></LI>

<H4>Provide <A name="date stamping">date stamping</A></H4>
<P>Knowledge can be relatively stable (basic math, anatomy, taxonomy, physical geography, etc.) and highly volatile (economic indicators, high-tech knowledge, personal statistics, etc.). It is important that you provide your items with time stamping or other tags indicating the degree of obsolescence. In case of statistical figures, you might stamp them with the year they have been collected. When learning software applications, it is enough you stamp the item with the software version. Once you have newer figures you can update your items. Unfortunately, in most cases you will have to re-memorize knowledge that became outdated. Date stamping is useful in editing and verifying your knowledge; however, you will rarely want to memorize stamping itself. If you would like to remember the changes of a given figure in time (e.g. GNP figures over a number of years), the date stamping becomes the learned knowledge itself.</P></LI>

<H4><A name=Prioritize>Prioritize</A></H4>
<P>You will always face far more knowledge that you will be able to master. That is why prioritizing is critical for building quality knowledge in the long-term. The way you prioritize will affect the way your knowledge slots in. This will also affect the speed of learning (e.g. see: <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Build upon the basics"><FONT color=#0066cc>learn basics first</FONT></A>). There are many stages at which prioritizing will take place; only few are relevant to knowledge representation, but all are important:</P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Prioritizing sources</STRONG> - there will always be a number of sources of your knowledge. If you are still at student years: these will most likely be books and notes pertaining to different subjects. Otherwise you will probably rely more on journals, Internet, TV, newspapers, encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc. It is always worth being aware what is the optimum proportion of time devoted to those varied sources. As you progress with learning, you will quickly develop a good sense of which learning slots bring better results and which might be extended at the cost of others</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Extracting knowledge</STRONG> - unless you are about to pass an important exam, it nearly never makes sense to memorize whole books or whole articles. You will need to extract those parts that are most likely to impact the quality of your knowledge. You can do it by (1) marking paragraphs in a book or journal, (2) pasting relevant web pages to SuperMemo, (3) pasting relevant passages to SuperMemo, (4) typing facts and figures directly to SuperMemo notes, etc. You will need some experience before you can accurately measure how much knowledge you can indeed transfer to your brain and what degree of detail you can feasibly master. Your best way to prioritize the flow of knowledge into your memory is to use <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/read.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>incremental reading</FONT></A> tools</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Transferring knowledge to SuperMemo</STRONG> - you may try to stick with the 20 rules of formulating knowledge at the moment of introducing your material to SuperMemo. However, you can also literally transfer your notes or import whole files and later use the mechanisms provided by SuperMemo to determine the order of processing the imported material. Probably the best criterion for choosing between formulating or just importing is the time needed for accurately formulating the item or items. If formulation requires more knowledge, more time, comparing with other sources, etc. you can just import. Otherwise, if you believe that formulating an accurate item is a matter of seconds, formulate it</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Formulating items</STRONG> - make sure that explanatory or optional components of the answer are placed in the parentheses so that your attention is focused on the most important part of the item. The parts in the parentheses can be read after the repetition to strengthen the memory in its context</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Using forgetting index</STRONG> - you can use the <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/fi.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>forgetting index</FONT></A> to prioritize pending items. The sequence of repetitions will naturally be determined by SuperMemo; however, you can request higher retention level for items that are more important and lower retention level for items of lower priority</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Learning</STRONG> - the process of prioritizing does not end with the onset of repetitions. Here are the tools you can use to continue setting your priorities while the learning process is under way: 
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Remember</STRONG> (<EM>Ctrl+M</EM>) - re-memorize items of high priority that have changed or which are extremely important to your knowledge at a given moment. If you choose <EM><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/shortcuts.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Ctrl+M</FONT></A></EM> you will be able to determine the next interval for the currently reviewed item (its repetition counter will be reset to zero). It is recommended that you always re-memorize items whose content has changed significantly</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Reschedule</STRONG> (<EM>Ctrl+J</EM>) - manually schedule the date of the next repetition</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Execute repetition</STRONG> (<EM>Ctrl+Shift+R</EM>) - manually execute a repetition even before the repetition's due date (e.g. when reviewing particularly important material)</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Forget</STRONG> (<EM>Ctrl+R</EM>) - remove the current item from the learning process and place it at the end of the <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/g.htm#pending_queue"><FONT color=#0066cc>pending queue</FONT></A></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Dismiss</STRONG> (<EM>Ctrl+D</EM>) - ignore the current item in the learning process altogether</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Delete</STRONG> (<EM>Ctrl+Shift+Del</EM>) - remove the current item from your collection</LI>
<LI>Change the forgetting index of memorized items or change the ordinal of pending items (<EM>Ctrl+Shift+P</EM>)</LI></OL></LI></OL></LI></OL>
<H3>Summary</H3>
<P>Here again are the twenty rules of formulating knowledge. You will notice that the first 16 rules revolve around making memories simple! Some of the rules strongly overlap. For example: <STRONG>do not learn if you do not understand</STRONG> is a form of applying the <STRONG>minimum information principle</STRONG> which again is a way of making things simple: 
<OL>
<LI><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Do not learn if you do not understand"><STRONG><FONT color=#0066cc>Do not learn if you do not understand</FONT></STRONG></A></LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Learn before you memorize"><FONT color=#0066cc>Learn before you memorize</FONT></A></STRONG> - build the picture of the whole before you dismember it into simple items in SuperMemo. If the whole shows holes, review it again!</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Build upon the basics"><FONT color=#0066cc>Build upon the basics</FONT></A></STRONG> - never jump both feet into a complex manual because you may never see the end. Well remembered basics will help the remaining knowledge easily fit in</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#minimum information principle"><FONT color=#0066cc>Stick to the minimum information principle</FONT></A></STRONG> - if you continue forgetting an item, try to make it as simple as possible. If it does not help, see the remaining rules (cloze deletion, graphics, mnemonic techniques, converting sets into enumerations, etc.)</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Cloze deletion"><FONT color=#0066cc>Cloze deletion is easy and effective</FONT></A></STRONG> - completing a deleted word or phrase is not only an effective way of learning. Most of all, it greatly speeds up formulating knowledge and is highly recommended for beginners</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Use imagery"><FONT color=#0066cc>Use imagery</FONT></A></STRONG> - a picture is worth a thousand words</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#mnemonic techniques"><FONT color=#0066cc>Use mnemonic techniques</FONT></A></STRONG> - read about peg lists and mind maps. Study the books by Tony Buzan. Learn how to convert memories into funny pictures. You won't have problems with phone numbers and complex figures</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Graphic deletion"><FONT color=#0066cc>Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion</FONT></A></STRONG> - obstructing parts of a picture is great for learning anatomy, geography and more</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Avoid sets"><FONT color=#0066cc>Avoid sets</FONT></A></STRONG> - larger sets are virtually un-memorizable unless you convert them into enumerations!</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Enumerations"><FONT color=#0066cc>Avoid enumerations</FONT></A></STRONG> - enumerations are also hard to remember but can be dealt with using cloze deletion</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Interference"><FONT color=#0066cc>Combat interference</FONT></A></STRONG> - even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal life</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Optimize wording"><FONT color=#0066cc>Optimize wording</FONT></A></STRONG> - like you reduce mathematical equations, you can reduce complex sentences into smart, compact and enjoyable maxims</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Refer to other memories"><FONT color=#0066cc>Refer to other memories</FONT></A></STRONG> - building memories on other memories generates a coherent and hermetic structure that forgetting is less likely to affect. Build upon the basics and use planned redundancy to fill in the gaps</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Personalize and provide examples"><FONT color=#0066cc>Personalize and provide examples</FONT></A> </STRONG>- personalization might be the most effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build upon well established memories</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Rely on emotional states"><FONT color=#0066cc>Rely on emotional states</FONT></A></STRONG> - emotions are related to memories. If you learn a fact in the sate of sadness, you are more likely to recall it if when you are sad. Some memories can induce emotions and help you employ this property of the brain in remembering</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Context cues"><FONT color=#0066cc>Context cues simplify wording</FONT></A></STRONG> - providing context is a way of simplifying memories, building upon earlier knowledge and avoiding interference</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Redundancy"><FONT color=#0066cc>Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle</FONT></A></STRONG> - some forms of redundancy are welcome. There is little harm in memorizing the same fact as viewed from different angles. Passive and active approach is particularly practicable in learning word-pairs. Memorizing derivation steps in problem solving is a way towards boosting your intellectual powers!</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#sources"><FONT color=#0066cc>Provide sources</FONT></A></STRONG> - sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#date stamping"><FONT color=#0066cc>Provide date stamping</FONT></A></STRONG> - time stamping is useful for volatile knowledge that changes in time</LI>
<LI><STRONG><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Prioritize"><FONT color=#0066cc>Prioritize</FONT></A></STRONG> - effective learning is all about prioritizing. In <EM>incremental reading</EM> you can start from badly formulated knowledge and improve its shape as you proceed with learning (in proportion to the cost of inappropriate formulation). If need be, you can review pieces of knowledge again, split it into parts, reformulate, reprioritize, or delete.

<H1><FONT size=3>In this article I will attempt to show that it is feasible to dismember learned knowledge into small pieces that can be attributed to individual semantic units of topics in a knowledge system subject to a learning procedure. I also predict the inevitability of such an approach in future self-instruction systems based on active recall.</FONT></H1>
<P><FONT size=3>We will discuss elements that, independently of the <A href="https://www.super-memory.com/english/algsm11.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>repetition spacing algorithm</FONT></A> (e.g. as used in <A href="https://www.super-memory.com/english/princip.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>SuperMemo</FONT></A>), influence the effectiveness of learning. In particular we will see, using examples from a simple knowledge system used in learning microeconomics, how knowledge representation affects the easiness with which knowledge can be retained in the student&#8217;s memory. The microeconomics knowledge system has almost entirely been based on the material included in <EM>Economics of the firm. Theory and practice</EM> by Arthur A. Thompson, Jr, 1989. Some general concepts of macroeconomics have been added from <EM>Macroeconomics</EM> by M. McKenzie, 1986, while the mathematical capsule items have been taken from <EM>Marketing Research</EM> by David A. Aaker and George S. Day, 1990. </FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>Before I move toward representation of knowledge, I would only shortly like to list some other principles of effective learning that are representation independent:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=3>because of the atomic nature of knowledge implied by the principles of <A href="https://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#repetition_spacing"><FONT color=#0066cc>repetition spacing</FONT></A> algorithms such as <A href="https://www.super-memory.com/english/algsm11.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Algorithm SM-8</FONT></A>, repetitions of question-answer items must not be equated with learning <EM>per se</EM>. In the process of learning, the coherent graph of semantic links between elements of the learned material is formed. This graph can be constructed by means of item-by-item build up; however, a standard textbook, hypertext document or interactive tutor will always have an efficacy advantage because of no implied granularity constraint. In other words, one should always learn first, and only then work with a repetition spacing system in order to retain the newly formed memory engrams over a longer period of time. An important note is due here: granularity of knowledge in repetition spacing is an inherent characteristic of human memory rather than a drawback of the method. After all, it does not prevent an associative nature of knowledge as stored in memory. It affects only the way stimuli are presented at repetitions in order to maximize the memory effect.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>a fundamental principle of learning is to apply <A href="https://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#active_recall"><FONT color=#0066cc>active recall</FONT></A> rather than passive recognition. Active recall is more demanding from the memory consolidation standpoint, and it is closer to matching the real life situations with respect to what sort of synaptic connections should be strengthened.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>the degree of concentration on the learned or repeated material has an enormous impact on the effectiveness of learning; however, it is in major part knowledge system-independent and cannot significantly be influenced by a knowledge system developer</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>the inherent phenomenon associated with repetition spacing algorithms is the accumulation of material in cases of breaks in learning. This imposes a moderation constraint on the student, as piling up outstanding repetition material negatively affects the student&#8217;s attitude towards the learning process</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>finally, a whole range of mental and physical health aspects affects the learning process, but these consideration reach far beyond the scope of the presented text</FONT></LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A name=Representation><FONT size=5><B>Knowledge representation issue in learning </B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>It has been known for ages that the way knowledge is represented affects the way it is remembered, and consequently, the degree of how easily it can be retained in memory over a longer period.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The art of mnemonics is as old as the art of learning, and professional mnemonists, with their trained memory capabilities, can truly leave an average mortal speechless in face of top mnemonic feats. Indeed, the mnemonic techniques are very easy to apply, and most of capable students, more or less consciously, use them in their daily routine. However, by conscious understanding of the rules and principles, even the best students can gain a great deal. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The basic principle of mnemonics, from the neurobiological point of view, is to build memory images from as many previously stored engrams as it is only possible. As visual processing in the human brain seems to involve much more sophisticated circuitry than, for example, verbal processing, extensive use of visual imagery is a key to success. Instead of memorizing a nonsensic telephone number, the student can memorize a collection of visual scenes unequivocally mapped to numbers, and generate a unique, easily memorizable sequence of graphic events that can serve as an effective way of representing the number. Recalling the phone number can then be equivalent to invoking the stored visual event and translating it to the sequence of digits, or more often, to a sequence of two-figure numbers. As I will try to argue in later paragraphs, minimizing the number of synaptic connections involved in storing memories is the key to maximizing retention over a longer period. Representing new memories as easily recoverable composites of old memories serves exactly that end.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>To simplify the discussion of knowledge representation issues with respect to the complexity of neural connections involved in storing particular engram, I will shortly introduce a concept of a synaptic pattern.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>As early as since the introduction of sensitive neural activity measurement techniques, it has been known that memories can be associated with spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic activity, or synaptic patterns in short. There exists a substantial terminology confusion as far as naming the concept of the synaptic pattern is concerned. Therefore, it is worth noticing than in relevant literature, the notion of synaptic patterns, often devoid of its temporal component, might be used more or less synonymously with terms such as: cell assembly, neural structure, synaptic structure, synaptic net, synaptic activity pattern, etc. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>As I will try to show in the chapter devoted to biological aspects of memory, the complexity of synaptic patterns is likely to be in strict correlation with item difficulty (e.g. as expressed by the <A href="https://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#A-factor"><FONT color=#0066cc>A-factor</FONT></A>). It is therefore central to understanding the principles of effective representation of knowledge in self-instruction systems based on active recall and repetition spacing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Items that do not comply with minimum complexity of synaptic patterns will, in the course of repetition, gradually experience loss of its components. In other words, memory will accomplish natural selection of the core synaptic pattern with elimination of all additional connections that do not get uniformly stimulated at repetitions. In later sections, I will use the term <EM>pattern extraction</EM> to describe the phenomenon of selecting the core synaptic pattern in the course of repetitions</FONT></P>
<P><A name=Components><FONT size=5><B>Components of effective knowledge representation in active recall systems</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>All the principles of effective knowledge representation discussed in the following section come from years of experience in developing knowledge systems for my own use, as well as from a continuing opportunity to study the relationship between item difficulty and knowledge representation in knowledge systems developed by users of SuperMemo, many of whom seek professional advice before embarking on major knowledge system development, or equally often are eager to share their own experience and problems encountered while applying repetition spacing in all imaginable learning domains.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The following are the five thematic groups related to knowledge representation in self-instruction systems based on active recall:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=3>the sequence in which particular items are stored in the knowledge system as a element of effective build-up of intricate knowledge structures in the student&#8217;s brain</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>minimization of the synaptic pattern complexity by application of principles such as minimum information principle, narrowing by example, metaphoric approach, vivid approach, graphic approach, deletion, graphic deletion, mnemonic techniques, enumeration techniques, eliminating interference, etc.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>redundancy in establishing synaptic patterns as a means of minimizing the damage to associative knowledge structures via forgetting (using passive and active approach, flexible repetition, reasoning clues, derivation steps, etc.)</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>wording optimization as a means of affecting error rates, stimulation specificity, response time, concentration, etc.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>knowledge independent functionality (sourcing, subdomain classification, update markers, etc.)</FONT></LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>In the five following sections I will address all the above thematic groups individually using examples from the aforementioned knowledge system on microeconomics</FONT></P>
<P><A name=Sequencing><FONT size=4><B>Sequencing items in the stepwise process of acquiring associative knowledge</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The most important rule in sequencing items is inherently related to the learning process in general. The progression must go from basic concepts through foundations to more intricate and detailed issues. In all forms of learning, this principle derives from the need for comprehension, which obviously is greatly reduced when the student is thrown at a deep end at once. In application of repetition spacing with low <A href="https://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#forgetting_index"><FONT color=#0066cc>forgetting index</FONT></A>, this approach has also another important aspect. As in this form of learning, forgetting plays an insignificant role, the student is likely to experience the phenomenon of new pieces of knowledge nicely slotting in in the already established structure. This might affect the sequencing algorithm by moving it from truly basics-to-details approach to first-comprehended-first-memorized approach which dispenses with the need for full comprehension at the first contact with the newly learned material. This way the student will less likely experience the feeling of getting stuck because of his or her inability to comprehend some concept and, at the same time, reluctance to proceed any further out of fear of snowballing incomprehension. Thus, in the first pass of the material, the student will memorize only those components that have been comprehended, and hope that the slotting-in phenomenon will eliminate of comprehension gaps in the second pass.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The basics-to-details approach may be combined successfully with the most-applicable approach, in which the student delves more rapidly into details of those parts of the material which are most frequently referenced in other parts. This enhances the slotting-in phenomenon, which is one of the strongest motivational factors in learning, providing the student with the sense of accomplishment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>There is no cut-and-dried algorithm for optimally sequencing items then, however, in slightly more formal terms, the optimum sequencing might be defined as bicriterial optimization in which the following two factors are considered:</FONT> 
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=3>primitiveness of the considered item, i.e. number of semantic dependencies on other items in the sequenced group</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>applicability of the item, i.e. the frequency with which the item appears in semantic dependencies of other items (or if it can easily be quantified, the frequency with which the item is more or less directly referred to in the learning materials accompanying the database, or even in the daily application of the learned knowledge in real life situations)</FONT></LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>As an example let us consider the definition of the concept of production in economics. Production is commonly assumed to be synonymous with manufacturing. However, a more accurate and useful definition of production, from the economic analysis standpoint, is as any activity that creates value. The following item placed in the student&#8217;s memory is likely to profoundly affect the students interpretation of the concept:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is production?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: any activity that creates value</B></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>As it will be shown later, it is always recommended to apply both the ability to associate the name with the concept, as well as the concept with the name; therefore, the following mirror item should also appear in the same database:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the name of an activity that creates value (in economics)?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: production</B></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>In the analysis of the aspects of production in economics, a more precise definition of production maybe useful for the sake of classifying its nature from the cybernetic standpoint. As the above definition provided an intuitive understanding and severed the link between production and manufacturing, the definition presented above, not quite consistent with the previous approach may have greater applicability in cases where the production process becomes the focus of more detailed analysis, esp. using economic models: "production is a series of activities by which resource inputs are transformed through a recipe and technological process into outputs of goods and services". Because of the fundamental nature of the concept, the very exact imprint of the above definition may be considered a valuable asset in building more advanced facets of knowledge of economics. The difficulty with basic concepts is that they are so basic that they cannot be asked for in yet more basic terms. Questions like "what is production?" demanding the by-heart recitation of the definition, as it will be shown later, entirely misses the point of building true comprehension (cf. simplicity of synaptic patterns and specificity of synaptic stimulation). Simplifying the answer to "series of activities" and following it with a number of items that define the "activities" is also inadmissible because of a number of adequate substitutes for "series of activities" like, for example, "any activity that creates value", and many more. Here, a very valuable, and often underappreciated tool of Cloze deletion comes handy. Consider the following wording of items:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>The question arises if the aforementioned set of items will generate the desired effect which is the comprehension of the concept of production along the definition provided earlier. The experience shows that despite seemingly high degree of dissociation between the particular components of the learned concept, the presented items appear to produce a solid imprint in the students memory that not only provides a firm support for stable comprehension, but also makes it possible to effortlessly recite the entire definition of production. E-factors for such constructed items typically fall into the range from 2.0 to 2.8 depending on other elements affecting memorization with interference as the most prominent factor. Despite a larger number of items, this is a sure guarantee to produce less workload than in the case of cramming the entire definition in the answer with E-factor most likely to drop below 1.5.</FONT></P>

<P><A name=Complexity><FONT size=4><B>Techniques for minimizing the complexity of synaptic patterns as a key to keeping E-factors high</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The most important principle of effective knowledge representation in systems based on active recall and repetition spacing is minimization of the complexity of synaptic patterns involved in storing memory engrams (<A href="https://www.super-memory.com/english/ol.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Wozniak, 1990</FONT></A>). This principle translates to keeping the content of question-answer items simple, specific, graphic, consistent, comprehensible and univocal. The main purpose of such an approach is to make sure that the spatiotemporal pattern of firing during the learning task is the same in each successive repetition. In other words, there should be minimum change to the synaptic pattern in the course of repetition as a result of pattern extraction. The entire concept of optimum repetition spacing is based on dealing with uniform pieces of information whose memory engrams are uniform and stable, and consequently can be treated as atomic entities. If the neuronal firing was to change its course over a number of repetition, a subset of synapses in the relevant synaptic pattern would not receive sufficient enhancement resulting in partial loss of the learned information.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Using examples from the microeconomics database, I will show all the distinguishable facets of minimization of synaptic patterns involved in representing individual pieces of information stored in the database.</FONT></P>
<P><A name=Comprehension><FONT size=3><B>Comprehension</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>It has been strongly pointed in the preceding section that the basics-to-details approach is, among other things, supposed to ensure the maximum level of comprehension. Here I will only note that comprehension is indeed related to the minimization of the complexity of synaptic patters that is the subject of this chapter. Nonsensical phrases or concepts involve a much greater number of neurons in the process of learning. Low-level electrical measurements showed that the neural activity is higher in cases of memorizing nonsensical words as opposed to natural words. Similarly, PET scans show that the brain activity of people exhibiting high IQ is much lower during performing a learning tasks that it is the case for low IQ students. Finally, it was shown that memory for people&#8217;s professions is more stable than the memory for their names. This was explained by psychologists as being related to the fact that well-established synaptic patters representing various professions are usually not matched by similar patterns that could be used easily used to represent names, esp. surnames.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>Let us consider the shortcomings of competitive markets such as unequal distribution of income, imposition of production costs on the public, development of socially undesirable products, product proliferation, etc. The minimum information principles says that the question "What are the shortcomings of competitive markets?" cannot be accepted because of the complexity of the answer. In such situations, solution comes from narrowing the focus of the question; the approach which often requires additional terminology and knowledge structuring, and is generally more demanding for the database developer. A typical question with a narrower focus might sound as follows:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What problem with distribution of income appears on a competitive market?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: income is concentrated in the hands of few</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>or,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is an example of imposing production costs on people who do not consume in competitive markets?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: environmental pollution</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The set of specific questions as those presented above produce a very high level of knowledge retention; however, the question arises if it is equivalent with the student&#8217;s being able to pinpoint the most important shortcomings of competitive markets. The experience shows that a number of items that would glue the above granules in a coherent entirety is necessary. This can conveniently be accomplished by means of Cloze deletions discussed later in the chapter. For example:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: The main shortcomings of competitive markets are:</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>- redistribution of income (the haves &amp; have-nots)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>- imposition of production costs (pollution)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>- ... (illicit drugs)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>- product proliferation (standardization issues)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: socially undesirable products</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The examples associated with particular shortcomings of competitive markets presented above serve as a vivid enhancement and comprehension booster, but their main function is to make it easier to track the missing clause. After all, as it will be shown later, enumerations are one of the trickiest obstacles to overcome in complying with the minimum information principle. The presented Cloze deletion serves as: (1) tool for mastering the terminology related to the discussed shortcomings, while the conceptual answer is indeed strongly suggested by examples accompanying the enumerations, (2) graphic skeleton for hooking up pieces of knowledge acquired by narrow-focus questions as presented earlier.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>A yet more complex knowledge structure appears in the analysis of tax revenues in an attempt to plot the Laffer curve for European countries in the years 1975-1982. Upon the analysis, on the two ends of the spectrum, notable examples of two countries are worth considering: Sweden and Spain. The former, with the average tax rate of 49% showed 12% decline in tax revenue, while the latter with the average tax rate of 23% experienced a remarkable increase in tax revenues of 60%. Naturally, a single item cramming all the above facts has little chance of passing the minimum information criterion. Consider then the following items intended to ensure the student&#8217;s recall the facts related to tax rate vs tax revenue relationship:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What was the average tax rate in Spain 1975-1982?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: 23%</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What was the change in the tax revenue in Spain 1975-1982?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: 60% increase</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Unfortunately, similar questions asked for Sweden do not form a coherent memory image that would allow the student recall the entire collection of information pieces that make up the understanding of the relationship illustrated by the Laffer curve. Naturally, the understanding does not need examples. The theoretical implications of marginal tax revenue might be considered as a sufficient element of understanding; however, the usefulness of facts illustrating the theory has long been appreciated in education; I will therefore present for consideration an exemplary set of items acting as an associative glue for the discussed tax revenue case:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: In the years 1975-1982, the average tax rate and the tax revenue in Spain and Sweden were as follows:</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Spain: ...% and 60% (respectively)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Sweden: 49% and -12% (respectively)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: 23</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>and in a similar way:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: In the years 1975-1982, the average tax rate and the tax revenue in Spain and Sweden were as follows:</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>...: 23% and 60% (respectively)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Sweden: 49% and -12% (respectively)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: Spain, </B>etc., etc.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Items formulated in the above way appeared to produce very coherent memory engrams that showed above average retention rate despite the inherent intractability of numeric responses (as in the first of the two presented examples).</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT size=2><B>A: price ceiling</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>In the example above, the phrases "(e.g. medications)" serves as the means of narrowing by example. Similarly, the illustration of competitive nature of pork versus beef helps narrowing by example in the definition of horizontal markets:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>The difference between demand and quantity demanded is that demand is described by the quantity-price curve, while quantity demanded is the value of demand for a given price level. The answer to the question "What is the difference between demand and quantity demanded?" might assume quite intricate wording if the above explanation was to be the way of grasping the learned difference. Instead, by extracting the essential nature of the difference in question, the following approach may be taken:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the difference between demand and quantity demanded?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: same as between a curve and a point </B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>This approach is by far more effective in ensuring the student&#8217;s comprehension, and what is equally important, the resulting E-factor is, in most cases, very high. The recommended extension to the presented answer might be placed in parentheses with, for example, the following wording: "demand is described by the quantity-price curve, while quantity demanded refers to a single point on the demand curve".</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Let us yet consider an example in which the metaphoric approach goes yet a step further by using nearly poetic language in order to describe economic concepts. In technology and innovation theories of profit, the creative effort of firms competing on the market can be translated into economic profit. In other words, technology and innovation are used to level monopolistic advantage of competitors, or to unbalance the conditions of perfect competition. By destroying the old, technology and innovation generates above normal profit. Here is a catchy item that is bound to show high E-factor value:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the figurative statement that accurately reflects the working of technology and innovation in generating profit?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: perennial gale of creative destruction</B></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Note, that the later-discussed vivid and graphic elements in memorized items serve exactly the same purpose as the metaphoric approach: capitalizing on existing memories, or even on inborn neural structures, to form steady memory engrams.</FONT></P>
<P><A name="Vivid approach"><FONT size=3><B>Vivid approach</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Formulating vivid, or even shock-evoking items, serves exactly the same purpose as metaphoric approach. The main difference here is that metaphoric approach capitalizes of existing declarative memories, while vivid approach makes use of the power of memories associated with circuits responsible for generating emotional impulsation. Here, derogatory terminology, humorous statements, reference to esthetics, taste, basic instincts, sex, etc. may serve as a powerful instrument enhancing memories. Additionally, vivid approach adds extra attractiveness to compliant databases, acting as a very desirable motivational factor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>In the world of business, the very typical approach to optimization of the firm&#8217;s performance is based on experience, intuition, guesswork and pure drive toward satisfying managers&#8217; fancies. This drove a flock of business writers to mock the merits of economic analysis, and even to discourage potential graduates of business schools from enrolling. After all, the reasoning goes, there is no better school than running one&#8217;s own business oneself. The damaging impact of such an attitude has annoyed top economic brains more than once, and gave plenty of scope for derogatory statements, often tinted with emotional overtones. Instead of providing here the statistics referring to the career record of the graduates of Harvard School of Business, a single vivid statement of a noble scholar might serve as a sufficient incentive to study the theoretical aspects of running one&#8217;s own business:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What was the opinion of Herbert Simon about the companies&#8217; attitude toward profit maximization?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: managers satisfice as they do not have wits to maximize</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Additionally, adding a statement in parentheses indicating the Herbert Simon&#8217;s authority (Nobel prize in economics) might enhance the emotional overtones of the statement by providing a sharper contrast between the wisdom of a scholar and the close-mindedness of the gray mass of smug and self-satisfied business managers.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A name="Graphic approach"><FONT size=3><B>Graphic approach</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The third technique based on capitalizing on previously established memories is the graphic approach. In previous sections, declarative memories and emotion memories have been employed. Graphic approach makes use of the powerful visual processing capability of the human brain. It has been discovered long ago that visual memories are by far more stable than verbal memories. Indeed, the core of mnemonic techniques makes use of the visual processing capabilities to enhance memory retention. In graphic approach, graphs, illustrations, photographs or video clips are used instead of verbal descriptions. As it will be shown later, textual representation of knowledge does not preclude graphic approach; nevertheless, it is usually a graphic figure that makes the most straightforward solution. </FONT></P>
<P><A name=Enumeration><FONT size=3><B>Enumeration techniques</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>One of the most fundamental principles in minimizing the complexity of synaptic patterns is to consequently avoid enumerations. Enumerations, especially with respect to sets as opposed to ordered lists, can be shown to result in an ambiguous impact on generating synaptic patterns. This can be observed even at the behavioral level, when at producing the response, the student is likely to stray with his or her thoughts, often producing the elements of the set in different order at each particular repetition. As mentioned earlier, variable synaptic stimulation at repetitions is likely to greatly reduce the effectiveness of memory consolidation; the net result being higher E-factor.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>In can be shown that luxury products, novel products or products that have good substitutes show highly negative price elasticity of demand, while the demand for basic necessities or durable goods is rather inelastic. This important observation is an excellent example of knowledge that might most conveniently be represented as an enumeration: "What exemplary goods show highly negative price elasticity?". Naturally, unless combined with some mnemonic way of remembering, the enumeration is bound to cause persistent recall problems. The simplest workaround here is to formulate a collection of questions according to the following pattern:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the price elasticity of demand for basic necessities?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: inelastic demand</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the price elasticity of demand for novel products?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: elastic demand</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The main difference between the semantic memory image of the proposed collection of questions and the relevant enumeration is the student&#8217;s inability to recall all, or even a proportion of goods with elastic, or inelastic demand. However, the analytically more useful understanding of the factors that influence the value of price elasticity of demand is even better served. A partial solution to the noticed shortcoming, which does not bear the negatives of an enumeration might be:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What exemplary goods show inelastic price demand (recall at least two)?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: basic necessities, durable products, saturative goods, unique products, etc.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The remark in the parentheses plays an important role in ensuring that the student does not treat the above item as an enumeration, and that it clearly specifies the satisfactory degree of recall that can be used to decide when and when not to provide a passing grade.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Another approach can be taken in extending the definition of production discussed earlier and considering various kinds of resource inputs. These can most generally be: raw materials, labor, capital, land and managerial skills. An enumeration of exemplary raw materials might be reversed to a definition of raw materials through an enumerative example:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the name of resource inputs such as coal, steel, water, etc.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: raw materials</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Finally, the most universal solution to enumerations are Cloze deletions. For example, instead of asking the student to recall different kinds of production such as unique product production, rigid mass production, flexible mass production and flow production, one might construct a series of Cloze deletion items in the following form:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: The types of production are:<BR>- unique-product production (e.g. an office building)<BR>- rigid mass production (e.g. old Ford's cars)<BR>- ... (e.g. new GM cars)<BR>- flow production (e.g. oil refinery)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: flexible mass production</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The above approach is universal and, in most cases, highly effective in dispensing with the enumeration problem.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A name=Deletion><FONT size=3><B>Deletion and graphic deletion</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Deletion is a simple technique that makes it possible to quickly generate collections of items derived from the same complex piece of knowledge, for example an intricate sentence. In an item based on Cloze deletion, the question presents a coherent piece of knowledge with a single element missing (standardly replaced with three dots), while the answer provides the missing element. In the previous sections, a number of deletions have been presented in the context of item sequencing, minimum information principle and enumeration techniques. Here, I would only like to focus on graphic deletions and Cloze deletions that may capitalize on their graphic aspects.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Graphic deletions differ from previously presented deletions in this way that instead of textual elements, pieces of graphs are deleted or obstructed, and the answer might provide the missing piece or its name. Because of basing on visual processing capability of the cerebral cortex, graphic deletions are a powerful tool for representing knowledge with a view to minimizing pattern extraction in the course of repetitions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Deletion does not have to be graphic to make use of visual processing powers of the brain. The mere spatial distribution of particular textual components may evoke visual images that will increase the efficacy of recall. If enumerative deletions do not change the sequence in which enumerated elements appear in the question, their spatial location will strongly be imprinted in the students memory despite little emphasis on location at the recall time. This makes it easier to graphically visualize the enumeration. As a consequence, it is not unusual that the student will be able to recall the entire enumeration in spite of the fact that indeed neither of the items in the deletion group requires the knowledge of the enumeration itself to qualify for a passing grade at repetitions.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>Here again is an example of an item based on Cloze deletion. The important thing to notice is the clear visual image of the three-part enumerative structure evoked in the process of learning.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: The options for a higher cost company in competition with a more cost-effective rival:<BR>- ... (big losses expected)<BR>- collusion (rather illegal)<BR>- improvement (of the product or cost structure)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: price war</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Naturally, at least two other items of the same sort will appear in a well-structured database; the missing component being collusion and product of cost-efficiency improvement. Additionally, elements of the declarative part preceding the enumeration might be made missing. As a result, several items will work on enhancing the visual component of the textual structure; the net result being better recall of the elements and the entire piece of knowledge.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A name=Dismembering><FONT size=3><B>Dismembering complex concepts</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Until now, only relatively simple elements of the learned knowledge have been considered; however, some concepts may be best grasped by simultaneous understanding of a number of subconcepts put together in a tightly interlinked mesh. This will often include control systems, mathematical techniques, complex theoretical models, etc. The main striking difference between such complex concepts and the examples presented before is that the single meaningful unit of knowledge can be expressed in a single sentence or passage in the latter case, while the complex concepts might span several paragraphs, none of which might be taken separately as a meaningful whole. It is not true that the complexity of such concepts cannot be unraveled. The main reason for their existence is not any inherent property, but lack of, or no need for specialized terminology that might serve to separate the smaller units. Dealing with such concepts is particularly difficult, and requires special skills from the knowledge system developer. Very often, the ultimate solution comes from introducing new terminology that is suitable for describing all subcomponents separately.</FONT></P>

<P><A name=Mnemonics><FONT size=3><B>Mnemonic techniques</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Mnemonic techniques go one step further than the graphic approach in this sense that they use artificially redundant graphic images to represent unique or nonsensical information. One of the two fundamental mnemonic techniques are mind maps and peg lists. A mind map is a graph that in a vivid form represents the structure of semantic connections between particular components of the learned knowledge. A graphic model of market economy might be an example of a mind map; however, mind maps are applicable also to all pieces of semantically coherent knowledge, independent of their usual form of representation in standard textbooks. Thus, the computation of the combination of products that maximizes the customer&#8217;s total utility (see previous section) might also be presented in a graphic form. A flow chart is the most impelling proposition, though any other form of a not necessarily directed graph might do. An interesting variety of a mind map is a graph that is mapped on the image of a familiar object, e.g. one&#8217;s own apartment. Retrieving particular pieces of such a graph from memory is particularly easy, though the solution is not always universal because of the fact that each student would rather use mapping familiar for him or herself. The most often applied universal mapping is the one that pegs particular nodes of the mind map to the parts of the human body. The main shortcoming of the presented approach is strong interference between multiple mind maps pegged to the same object.<BR>Another popular mnemonic technique is peg lists. A peg list is a sequence of well visualized objects associated with cardinal numbers. For sophisticated applications, peg lists usually consist of 101 objects pegged to numbers from 0 to 100. The main application of peg lists is in remembering numbers and ordered enumerations. A 101-element peg list can be used to represent all numbers as sequential visual scenes composed of peg list equivalents of two-figure components of the remembered number. For example, assume that a phone number 867045 is supposed to be memorized by means of a peg list. Assume that the following images are associated with the two-figure components of the number: 86 - car (first car was built by Carl Benz in 1886), 70 - phone (Graham Bell invented the phone in 1870), and 45 - bomb (the date of Hiroshima bombing). If we imagine a scene in which we drive a car, pick-up a mobile phone and spark off a great fireball by activating the ringer, then we have effectively mapped an otherwise nonsensic phone number onto an easily retrievable graphic scene (the mapping being effected through the peg list). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>To illustrate the phenomenon of increasing returns to scale, and the incredible competitive advantage the Ford Motor Company has gained in the early 1900s over its competitors though specialization of labor based on semi-automated assembly lines, the student might wish to note that in 1914 the FMC produced 270,000 cars with 13,000 employees; while the other 299 American auto companies at the same time, with 66,000 employees produced just 290,000 cars. The example posses a serious dilemma to a database developer. Each of the number quoted makes up useless garbage knowledge. However, taken together, the figure combine into a vivid and compelling illustration of increasing returns to scale and their importance in running any kind of business. Demanding from the student the understanding of increasing returns to scale deprives the example from its strong emotional overtones, as the student might identify him or herself with Henry Ford&#8217;s business cunning. Depriving the example from numbers takes a great deal of its vividness. The two proposed solutions are: (1) limit the question to an estimated figure that shows the FMC lead in the market, and (2) use Cloze deletion to dismember the above sentence, and use mnemonics to memorize the involved numbers. The first approach might look as follows:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What was the share of the American automobile market commanded by the Ford Motor Company in 1914?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: Close to 50%</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>The seemingly flippant comments in the parentheses above are part and parcel of mnemonic representation.

<P><FONT size=3>As the analysis of intractable items in numerous databases show that numbers take the lead in making items indigestible to human memory, the use of numbers in databases of all sort should be limited to the absolute minimum. As the discussed database on microeconomics was notably sparse in numbers (mathematical formulas do not count here), the above example was a notable exception, and, perhaps for that reason, did not cause any serious recall problems. However, had there been more such numerically saturated cases, the issue could have started being a problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>A very typical interference problem is the terminological ambiguity. For example, there is nothing wrong with the question "What is the formula for marginal rate of substitution?" as long as the substitution of two competing products is concerned. However, as soon as we move to the isoquant analysis of the production process, the marginal rate of substitution of capital for labor starts interfering with the until now simple picture. Indeed, in the latter case, the correct term to use is the marginal rate of technical substitution; however, this terminological nuance does not help much to eliminate the interference problem. A very simple solution to the above interference problem is to provide strong context clues in the question. For example:</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2>Q: What is the formula for marginal rate of substitution of <FONT color=#ff0000>products X and Y</FONT>?</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: dX/dY</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=3>Though the solutions to the problem of interference usually appear to be very simple, the mere process of locating potentially interfering item poses a formidable challenge to a learning material developer. Indeed, there is only one true and tried method of eliminating interfering items: memorizing the entire material. Only the neural network of the human brain can on-the-fly spot the problematic similarities. This clearly illustrates the fact that practically no learning material designed for active recall in repetition spacing should be designed in detachment from the natural learning process. This naturally increases the development costs manifold.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>Let us now consider a case of strong semantic inter-item interference. The following items all deal with the problem of diseconomies of scale; however, no explicit interference problem strikes the eye at first:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: Why does the theory claim that every firm must reach a point of constant returns to scale with increasing output?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: by striving to push the production to the limits, the company must at some point decrease its cost efficiency (overloading people, machinery, facilities, etc.)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: Why corporations may encounter problems when growing beyond a certain point (cf. River Rouge plant)?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: because of managerial problems</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the main factor of diseconomies of scale in the US economy?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: trade union activity</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Upon a closer look, it appears that semantically, all the above items ask the same question "What are the reasons of diseconomies of scale?", while each of the item provides a different answer. Naturally, this is a trouble in the making for the student. It want take long before he or she starts confusing the River Rouge case with trade union activity problems, or attribute the U-shaped cost curve to dimension-related managerial problems. In a well-designed, interference free learning material, there is little choice but to use some of enumeration techniques to list the most important factors contributing to decreasing returns to scale.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>As I tried to demonstrate, the authors of learning material have little choice but to memorize their own material before making it available to a wider group of students.

<P><A name=Redundancy><FONT size=4><B>Planned redundancy as a way to cross-strengthening synaptic patterns</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>In this subchapter I will discuss techniques that, in a sense, go against the approach based on minimum complexity of synaptic patterns. Namely, I will show the importance of redundancy of knowledge representation in effective recall of information. The paradoxical contradiction between the previous and the presented approach can quickly be resolved if we notice that the redundancy is not understood here as adding extra components to otherwise minimally intricate synaptic patterns. The function of redundancy is here exclusively to promote the establishment of additional synaptic patterns serving as emergency access routes to the remembered knowledge. Redundant items will by no means duplicate their content in the database, at least not in the syntactic terms. This, first of all, would go against the principles of the repetition spacing algorithm, which assumes the uniqueness of items as one of its fundamental premises. However, the same semantic contents might be expressed using different means for the sake of providing the pattern-matching neural network of the brain with an opportunity to derive the semantic common denominator (as, for instance, in items that use multiple narrowing by example). The derivation of the common denominator will naturally proceed through the mechanism of pattern extraction. The redundancy will generally comprise the following elements:</FONT> 
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=3>using both active and passive recall</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>providing accessory reasoning derivation steps</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>providing optional reasoning context</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT size=3>providing multiple representation for semantically homologous items</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT size=3>The main function of redundancy is not to make items easy to remember, but to make sure that forgetting an item does not affect the entire associative structure of the knowledge graph. Forgetting, as it should be stressed here, makes an inherent part of repetition spacing algorithms, and cannot be by any means eliminated. The ideal model of 100% retention is for biological reasons unfeasible. Redundancy is supposed to minimize the possible effects of forgetting on the performance of the learned skill.</FONT></P>
<P><A name="Active recall"><FONT size=3><B>Passive and active approach</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The simplest illustration of redundancy via passivization is in the case of learning new terminology. The basic idea is to construct items in such a way that the definition of the concept and its name are placed one&#8217;s as a question and once as an item. If the definition appears in the question, the brain makes an association between the concept and its name. If the name appears in the question, the brain learns how to recognize concepts by name. Although, very often learning the name of a defined concept is sufficient to passively recognize the concept by name, it is not always so; hence the importance of the redundant approach. Additionally, even if one of the item gets caught in the forgotten pool, the other may serve as the way to restore the forgotten memory. In other words, presenting concepts both in passive and active form serves on one hand as an extension of the memorized pattern and as a protection against incidental forgetting on the other.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>As an example of passive and active approach consider the following item:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the name of the curve determined by the quantities of two (or more) products in combinations that produce the same total utility?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: indifference curve</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is an indifference curve?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: curve determined by the quantities of products that produce the same utility</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>It is worth noting that in the second item, the answer has been simplified to the maximum possible extent to reduce its expected E-factor. Any possible inconsistencies resulting from such as simplification should rather be resolved by adding new items on the subject rather than making the answer more intricate.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A name=Intelligence><FONT size=3><B>Support for derivation, reasoning and intelligence</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The ageless dilemma of elements of nature vs. nurture in education has from the very beginning been bound to crop up in this chapter. I will try to show that elements of what is commonly understood as intelligence can be developed in the process of learning based on active recall and repetition spacing. There are two definitions of intelligence that are in common use, often without distinguishing one from the other. On one hand, intelligence can be understood as the brain&#8217;s ability to process information. On the other, the potential to develop such an ability is often used interchangeably with the ability itself. When we speak of somebody "he will solve this problem quickly; he is a very intelligent person" we use more of the first interpretation of intelligence. However, when we say "this student will do a great deal in his life; he is very intelligent" we employ more of the second interpretation. It is easy to notice that a great deal of inborn characteristics will influence intelligence in the sense of the potential to developing good information processing capabilities. Apart from the number of neurons and neuronal connections, development of the glia and other elements that give the nervous tissue more scope for plasticity, such personality characteristics as mental and emotional stability, high levels of serotonin and dopamine, etc. may play equally important role in developing intelligence. If we, however, consider intelligence as the ability to process information, most of it will, as I will try to show, be developed in the course of education. What makes a bright mathematician is not just mathematical knowledge, not inborn talent, but the ability to associate various components of his or her knowledge of problem solving in mathematics. Consequently, properly represented knowledge of mathematical concepts, and more importantly, of mathematical reasoning will distinguish the nimble brain of a problem solver from the average mortal. The core knowledge of intelligent thinking, in mathematics and beyond, is the rules of mathematical derivation in the most abstract and universally applicable form. Those rules can be applied in a myriad of daily situations. This universal applicability in problem solving makes the basis of what others consider an intelligent person. If properly formulated and represented for learning, these rules can be memorized in a standard way; in other words, <B>memorization can be a way toward intelligence</B>!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>In this section, I will show several examples in which reasoning steps are entangled in the knowledge structure represented as question-answer items used in learning based on repetition spacing. A typical situation is when we have the general definition of a problem (i.e. not a particular problem instance), and we initially memorize the solution to the problem. For example, we might have the definition of the maximum utility problem (see <A href="https://www.super-memory.com/english/ol/ks.htm#Dismembering"><FONT color=#0066cc>Dismembering complex concepts</FONT></A>) combined with its solution of equal marginal utility for particular products. In case of significant importance of the particular problem-solution pair, adding particular reasoning steps (here partial differentiation and equating the results with zero) might on one hand provide derivation rules that contribute to the ability to solve similar problems and on the other provide a dose of redundancy whose role in sustaining memories has been highlighted earlier. It can be easily shown that eliminating the derivation steps will free the student&#8217;s memory from considering the steps of reasoning during repetitions. Additionally, requiring the student to solve the problem on his or her own each time the repetition takes place can be equated with enumerative learning which as I earlier tried to demonstrate, stands against the rule of minimizing the complexity of synaptic patterns, which is central to effective learning! In other words, apart from solving particular problem instances as a form of repetition, I see no reasonable alternative to pure memorization of derivation steps as the best means of boosting the student&#8217;s problem solving capability (i.e. intelligence in the first of the mentioned interpretations). The general rule then is: <B>whenever possible and sensible, memorize the derivation steps of a particular solution to a general problem</B>.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>Let us consider the concept of perfect substitutes as a simple example of providing knowledge extensions that should otherwise be deducible from previously learned facts and rules.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the name of products that are characterized by the same constant marginal utility?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: perfect substitutes</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the shape of the indifference curve for perfect substitutes?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: linear</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the name of two products whose indifference curve is linear?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: perfect substitutes</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The fact that the utility function of two products is the same, makes it possible to conclude that their indifference curve must be linear. However, the mere knowledge of the concepts definition will not by any means reinforce the understanding of this fact. In other words, the student may need substantial time to conclude the shape of the indifference curve. Having the fact memorized explicitly, not only smoothes up the derivation pathway from the definition of perfect substitutes to the shape of their indifference curve, but also serves as a strengthener of a more general and abstract rule which says that the derivative of the sum of functions with respect to a variable is equal to the sum of the derivatives. Naturally, the degree of strengthening depends on the student&#8217;s wish to use reasoning to derive answers rather than pure syntactic memory. In addition, the link between perfect substitutes and the linear indifference curve is reinforced through the reversal of the question and answer fields.<BR>Having memorized the above facts the student shows a higher degree of understanding of the concept of perfect substitutes, as well as a quicker response time in derivation tasks based on mathematically akin concepts. It is important that the derivation steps are short enough to comply with the principle of minimum complexity of synaptic patterns. Longer derivations might cause insufficient memory stimulation, and despite their being excellent problem solving drills, the value of their E-factor might turn them into intractable elements of the database that result in disillusionment and lack of enthusiasm on the part of the student.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Similar situation we can see in the case of the definition of complementary products, which can be amplified by the concept of cross-elasticity:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the name of products X and Y such that increasing purchases of X increases the purchases of Y?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: complementary products</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the formula for cross-elasticity of products X and Y?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: dX/dPy*(Py/X) (where Py is price of X)</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the name of products with negative cross-elasticity?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: complementary products</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Here, the third item serves as a memory strengthener for both complementary products and cross-elasticity. Additionally it serves as a derivation step that applies the abstract rule of the sign of a derivative.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Finally, I would like to show a trivial derivation step that may indeed be crucial for retrieving memories. Consider the following item:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: How can total revenue be computed from the demand curve at a given point?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: price*quantity</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Does it makes sense then to enhance the above item with one that is its direct and trivial consequence?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: Can total revenue be computed from the demand curve?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: yes</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Note, that the latter item sets thinking in terms of feasibility, not the procedure, algorithm or implementation. It can be shown, that a student who knows the procedure needed to execute to obtain the result, will not even attempt the execution because of lack of the feasibility conviction! In other words, one may be tempted not to ever try arriving at the solution. Thinking in terms of feasibility as opposed to thinking in terms of the procedure, give the reasoning two different contexts that might yield two different outputs. Such minor memory associations as presented in the above item, taken together, contribute to what is generally described as the problem solving ability.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A name=Clues><FONT size=3><B>Optional reasoning clues, mnemonic clues, context and examples</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The fact that items should comply with the minimum information principle does not mean that they cannot be in any way redundant in itself. It is only important to make sure that the compulsory content that is subject to the repetition does not contain redundant elements. Apart from that, the item itself may contain a great deal of accessory material that might be useful in learning. This can include context clues and explanations, reasoning clues, mnemonic clues, illustrative examples, or even hypertext links, etc. Each time it must only be clearly specified that the redundant contents is not compulsory and in any way needed for scoring the passing grade.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>It is well known that the total utility derived by the consumer from a number of goods is not the arithmetic sum of the particular utilities. This property derives from the fact that products may enhance or suppress each other&#8217;s utility. This fact can be comprised in an item formulated as follows:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: Why isn&#8217;t the total utility function a sum of utilities of particular products?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: because products may mutually enhance or suppress their utility</B></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>As I tried to show in the preceding section, a simple derivation step might enhance the student&#8217;s deductive ability with reference to the above piece of knowledge. This could be accomplished by a simple question like "Is the utility function a sum of utilities of particular products?". However, it appears to be useful to provide some redundancy to the answer element (which in this case is simply "no"):</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: Is the total utility function a sum of utilities of particular products?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A: no (because products may mutually enhance or suppress their utility)</B></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>Seemingly, this item became a sister copy of the one mentioned earlier. However, the compulsory semantic connection to be recalled in order to score a passing grade is different in these two cases. Again one item refers to the procedure, the other to feasibility. The explanatory part placed in parentheses is by no means needed to pass the repetition and serves exclusively as a memory strengthener, reasoning clue and reference note. The student may opt not to read the explanation at repetitions at all. However, if her or she notices that his or her response became automatic rather than semantic, the reasoning clue may serve to restore the right context and ground for the answer.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>Earlier, I presented an example of an item that used a mnemonic peg list as a support in remembering numerical responses. Mnemonic clues placed in parentheses may be the best way of remembering numbers; however, in some cases the number itself sticks easily to memory and the mnemonic part becomes unnecessary. It must be remembered, however, that in order to comply with the principle of uniform synaptic stimulation at repetition, the student should clearly set his or her mind or either using or ignoring the mnemonic clue.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Context clues and notational conventions may help making sure that the established memory link does not become meaningless in time, or worst of all, associated with wrong context.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>The concept of marginal revenue expressed in mathematical term is much easier to comprehend and retain in memory that its verbal equivalent. Here, however, it is strongly recommended that all symbols used in the equation be explained in an explanatory note, which does not take part in the learning process itself, and is used only as a verification means in case the used symbols started losing their meaning with the increase in the length of the inter-repetition interval.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2><B>Q: What is the formula for marginal revenue?</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=3>Finally, for highly associative knowledge, additional explanatory links, or even hypertext links, might help keeping the overall knowledge structure in place.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>For example, understanding the meaning of the Laffer curve does not necessarily entail the ability to recall its shape.

<P><A name=Wording><FONT size=4><B>Complexity of wording vs. comprehension</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Simplicity of item wording does not necessarily equate with the minimum information principle. The latter puts emphasis on the minimum complexity of the knowledge as it is represented in student&#8217;s memory. There is no imperative for items to be complex in their textual or graphic representation in the database itself. After all, some very simple concept may require quite a great deal of text to describe them verbally. However, it can be shown that excessive complexity of items as represented in the database may negatively affect the process of learning. The main problem is in miscomprehension and confusing different items through reading that naturally tends to be quick when the student is confronted with a massive number of repetitions per learning session. Very often, even the mere selection of words may affect the comprehension. As previously, also in such cases, the best remedy is the database author&#8217;s own work on memorizing the database in question and eliminating possible snags on a one by one basis. Such minor elements as moving a single phrase to a separate line may greatly help keeping E-factors high.</FONT></P>
<P><A name=Functionality><FONT size=4><B>Additional functionality encapsulated in items</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Finally, I would like to note that a database used for learning may, and usually is employed also for other purposes than acquiring knowledge. These may include archiving and retrieval purposes, literature sourcing for publication references, date stamping for facts that quickly change in time, individual mnemonic clues (i.e. clues related strictly to a particular student&#8217;s knowledge or life), domain labels, ordinal numbers for sorting databases, and many more.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>The date in the parentheses has no bearing on the learning process as long as there is only one item in the database that pertains to Japanese R&amp;D budget. However, it may appear useful in cases when the student deems necessary to update the figure after some time when it becomes exceedingly outdated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>A more extensive stamping can be seen in the example that follows. <BR>There is no rule as to what proportion of sales ends up as profit after taxes. However, global economic analysis makes it possible to establish the approximate figure for an average company. The main problem here is that the final value may strongly depend on the current economic situation of a particular country, as well as on the methods applied in the analysis. In the example below, the item provides the source of information that was used to estimate the net margin of profit.</FONT></P>

<P>The <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Twenty Rules</FONT></A> and my <A href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/memory/designing-precise-cards/"><FONT color=#0066cc>Rules for Designing Precise Anki Cards</FONT></A> are all very nice, but knowing all the rules doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you can do it yourself, or even fully understand the consequences of the rules. Sometimes it&#8217;s more informative to see the rules in action. So in this post, we&#8217;ll look at three case studies of real things I added to my Anki collection recently and how I selected and wrote the cards in accordance with these principles. The first focuses on some new English words, the second on historical British currency, and the third on some confusing behavior of a piece of software.</P>
<H2 id=vocabulary>Vocabulary</H2>
<P>First, let&#8217;s take something comparatively simple: words. We can make words as complicated as we want, but for the purposes of building vocabulary, we&#8217;re probably after one particular thing: when we see the word in a new context, we want to know what it means. Despite the apparent simplicity of what we want to learn, there is nuance in method even here; at least in my experience, the na&#239;ve approach to learning words is considerably less effective than a more considered one.</P>
<P>Let&#8217;s talk about sources for a moment. Every time I encounter a new word in English, I try to mark it down. With a paper book, I put a <A href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Darts-Count-Bronze-Bookmarks/dp/B007C6EU1A/"><FONT color=#0066cc>dart</FONT></A> next to the word; on my Kindle, I simply look up the word by long-pressing on it, which has the lovely side effect on recent Kindles of adding it to your &#8220;Vocabulary Builder,&#8221; which you can later look through to find all the words you looked up. I don&#8217;t encounter many new words in articles I read on the computer, but if I do I try to just scribble them down and add them immediately when I finish the article. If you&#8217;re actively learning a foreign language in a way that involves reading on the computer, you&#8217;ll be seeing a lot more new words, so you might need to come up with something better!</P>
<P>Now that we have the words, we have to create cards from them somehow. The easiest would be to type the word into a dictionary application, copy and paste the definition, and drop it onto a card. I don&#8217;t do this, though; it results in a pile of out-of-context cards. Out-of-context cards can be OK if you need volume; I learned an imported heap of several thousand cards in preparation for my <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT"><FONT color=#0066cc>SATs</FONT></A> and got a perfect score on the vocabulary section, in significant part due to that. But now that I know the vast majority of words I come across, but those I encounter are more unusual and harder to remember, it makes more sense to make the cards better. I haven&#8217;t done a controlled experiment, but I would be surprised if this didn&#8217;t come out faster in the end: it takes a bit longer to create the cards, but you spend less time reviewing them and the knowledge is more accessible.</P>
<P>Here&#8217;s what I include on my cards:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The <EM>word</EM> itself (of course). The word is the only thing that goes on the front of the card.</LI>
<LI>The <EM>definition</EM>. Rather than copying and pasting a definition, I put the word into Google and read through a variety of definitions, then write my own definition, striving to emphasize the way the word was used in the context where I encountered it. <A href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/memory/designing-precise-cards/#the-importance-of-asking-the-right-questions"><FONT color=#0066cc>Elaborative rehearsal</FONT></A> strikes again here.</LI>
<LI>The <EM>sentence</EM> (or, occasionally, several sentences, if needed) in which I initially saw the word. The word itself is in bold. This way, if I&#8217;ve forgotten the card, I can see an example of how it would be used. I find having and frequently seeing the sentence actually makes the definition easier to remember, too; I often have a vague notion of the example sentence when I look at the word, which makes it easier to remember what the word means, too.</LI>
<LI>The <EM>source</EM>, both because it&#8217;s fun to see and in case the sentence is ever not enough context and I want to go back and look.</LI></UL>
<P>I use a <A href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/editing?id=adding-a-note-type"><FONT color=#0066cc>custom note type</FONT></A> to store and format my cards.</P>
<P>Here are a couple of recent examples of this approach:</P>
<UL>
<LI>phalanstery 
<UL>

<P class=notice--info><STRONG>Theoretical note:</STRONG> Knowledge of a word comes in several stages: first, we&#8217;ll have no idea what the word means at all, except for a guess based on similar words; second, we might have a vague notion of what it means; third, we might be able to recite or explain the definition but have to think about it a little bit; fourth, we might fully understand it; then finally we might use it in our own speech or writing. The primary goal of putting vocabulary into Anki is to boost it from the first or second stage into the third. Anki can also help bring about the fourth and fifth stages by bringing the word to your attention at random times where you might be in a good position to use it, but this is a secondary benefit and not one you should count on.</P>
<H2 id=history>History</H2>
<P>I&#8217;ve been reading <A href="https://www.amazon.com/Intellectual-Life-British-Working-Classes/dp/0300153651/"><FONT color=#0066cc>The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes</FONT></A>, and every couple of pages it starts discussing the costs of things &#8211; books, classes, subscriptions, or the like. Since the time period being discussed is in the 1800s to early 1900s, this is all pre-decimal British currency, in pounds, shillings, and pence, with names of coins I&#8217;ve never heard of mixed in. Essentially, the prices of things being quoted are meaningless to me. I&#8217;m only a third of the way through the book, plus I&#8217;ve had this problem before with British literature. Let&#8217;s fix this by committing the basics of the system to memory.</P>
<P>Wikipedia should do fabulously as a source for something like this: well-established facts, little to dispute, and all we need is an overview. Let&#8217;s pull up <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=&#163;sd&amp;oldid=974307848"><FONT color=#0066cc>&#163;sd</FONT></A> and get reading. (That link is a snapshot of the current revision at the time I wrote this blog post, in case the structure of the article changes enough to make the post hard to understand.)</P>
<P>Before creating any cards, it&#8217;s usually a good idea to read the whole article, or at least a section at a time. If you don&#8217;t, you may shortly discover some things you added are irrelevant or even wrong, and you might miss out on opportunities for integration cards (more on that in a minute). If it&#8217;s a long article, you might want to scribble down notes on items you know you want to create cards for as you go, but this one is short enough that shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.</P>
<P>After reading the article, I conclude there are three main things from it that I want to retain:</P>
<OL>
<LI>What is the relationship between pounds, shillings, and pence?</LI>
<LI>How much of these were the common coins worth?</LI>
<LI>When was this system supplanted?</LI></OL>
<P>One other thing that&#8217;s <EM>not</EM> in the article: I&#8217;d like to know roughly the exchange rate with a currency I&#8217;m familiar with today, so I have at least a general sense of scale. We&#8217;ll come back to this later.</P>
<P>For question (1), the most obvious way would be simply to ask, &#8220;What is the relationship between pounds, shillings, and pence?&#8221; But if you&#8217;ve read either the <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>20 Rules</FONT></A> or my <A href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/memory/designing-precise-cards/"><FONT color=#0066cc>Creating Precise Cards</FONT></A>, or one of many other resources on creating spaced-repetition flashcards, you know that we&#8217;ll do better splitting this up into several atomic units. Rather than asking for the relationship between pounds, shillings, and pence, we&#8217;ll start with two questions:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: &#163;sd: How many pence are in a shilling?<BR>A: 12</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: &#163;sd: How many shillings are in a pound?<BR>A: 20</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Notice the prefix <EM>&#163;sd</EM> on the questions. The <A href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/memory/designing-precise-cards/#questions-should-be-context-free"><FONT color=#0066cc>context</FONT></A> of these questions may seem clear enough without it, but being extra-clear on the context of a question will never hurt, and something that looks clear while you&#8217;re adding cards may look vague during review. Who knows, maybe twenty years from now some new country will start using unrelated units called &#8220;shillings&#8221; and &#8220;pounds&#8221;!</P>
<P>I&#8217;m going to add one more card on this topic, an <EM>integration</EM> card. By &#8220;integration,&#8221; I mean that it doesn&#8217;t add any facts that we couldn&#8217;t in principle work out from the other cards we&#8217;ve already added; instead, it merely connects or integrates those other cards. Integration cards help keep the knowledge fresh and relevant in your mind by forcing you to use it and think about the relationships between the cards. A collection with no integration cards has a tendency to turn into a disconnected collection of facts, which makes review more boring and your memory worse.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: &#163;sd: How many pence are in a pound?<BR>A: 240</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(Look, it hasn&#8217;t even been a full minute, and we&#8217;ve already proved the need for the <EM>&#163;sd</EM> qualifier: there are 100 pence in a modern pound!)</P>
<P>Now for question (2). The table in the <EM>Decimalizations</EM> section of the article provides a handy list of the most common pre-decimal coins and their values. We don&#8217;t need to add cards for all of them; for instance, it is patently obvious that a sixpence coin is worth six pence. I&#8217;ll add cards for the florin, crown, half-crown, sovereign, and guinea, all following the same pattern:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: &#163;sd: How much is a guinea worth?<BR>A: 21 shillings</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The half-crown card deserves some notice, too, as it&#8217;s actually an integration card. I could have safely assumed I would remember that a half-crown is worth half of a crown, but I added it anyway because this is an opportunity to also touch the knowledge that half a shilling is sixpence, since five doesn&#8217;t divide evenly by two:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: &#163;sd: How much is a half-crown worth?<BR>A: 2/6 (2 shillings, 6 pence)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I managed to sneak in the written notation for shillings and pence from the <EM>Writing conventions and pronunciations</EM> section here, too, though since it is in the answer and not the question, I am not necessarily expecting to remember it. If I thought that was a crucial point, I&#8217;d want to add several cards about that.</P>
<P class=notice--info><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: If you&#8217;re really attentive and you&#8217;ve read the post on <A href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/memory/designing-precise-cards/"><FONT color=#0066cc>creating precise cards</FONT></A>, you might notice that the last two questions could be made more precise: I could conceivably give other correct answers. For instance, a half-crown could also be one-eighth of a pound, and a guinea could be 252 pence. But in this case, I think understanding what units should be used is actually part of understanding the &#163;sd system; if your first thought of how to express the value of a guinea is in pence, you are missing the point of the system! We could conceivably split each question into two questions, e.g., &#8220;How much is a guinea worth in shillings?&#8221; and &#8220;In what units should you express the worth of a guinea?&#8221;, but even to me that seems like it&#8217;s going further than necessary. If I notice I&#8217;m failing the card over and over for this reason, I&#8217;ll tackle simplifying it then.</P>
<P>For question (3), we really only need one question to accomplish my goal:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: &#163;sd: In what year was British currency decimalized?<BR>A: 1971</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>One more step: understanding how this relates to today&#8217;s currency. This was remarkably difficult to figure out, but I think I got it right! First I went to Wikipedia&#8217;s <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tables_of_historical_exchange_rates_to_the_United_States_dollar"><FONT color=#0066cc>table of historical exchange rates to the US dollar</FONT></A>, which has figures running back to 1850. Then we need to convert these figures into 2020 US dollars to get the understanding of scale I&#8217;m looking for, which we can do with <A href="https://wolframalpha.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>Wolfram|Alpha</FONT></A>. For instance, typing in <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$1 in 1850 in USD</CODE> yields the information that $1 in 1850 dollars is worth $34.71 in 2020 dollars. The exchange rate between pounds and dollars in 1850 was 0.2017, according to Wikipedia; we have to invert that to go from dollars to pounds, yielding approximately 4.957. Then:</P><SPAN class=MathJax_Preview style="COLOR: ; DISPLAY: none"></SPAN>

<P>Q: &#163;sd: About how much was an 1850 or 1900 penny worth in 2020 dollars?<BR>A: $0.60</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There. That&#8217;s 13 cards, <A href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/memory/how-much-to-learn-with-anki/#how-long-will-it-take-to-learn-one-card"><FONT color=#0066cc>total lifetime cost</FONT></A> of maybe 40 minutes, and I&#8217;ll have a continuing basis for comparison with one of the most influential (and confusing) currency systems in modern history.</P>
<P>Now, I might want to make some changes later on. For instance, perhaps the <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groat_(coin)"><FONT color=#0066cc>groat</FONT></A> comes up in something I&#8217;m reading and I want to make a note of how much that&#8217;s worth. The great thing is that now that I won&#8217;t forget the basics, these kinds of additions will be easy: I have a way of judging if new information is interesting or important, and instead of having to read an article and create a whole structure of knowledge in my head, I can likely run a 30-second Google search and, should I decide it&#8217;s worthwhile, drop one card into my collection. Similarly, maybe 30 years from now I want to rerun the conversion math with the current value of the US dollar (notice that I wrote &#8220;2020 dollars&#8221;, not just &#8220;dollars&#8221; &#8211; spaced-repetition flashcards need to be written to age well!).</P>
<H2 id=programming>Programming</H2>
<P>Today at work I was trying to debug a problem with an automated build in <A href="https://dev.azure.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>Azure DevOps</FONT></A>, and I created another bug while debugging that prevented me from attacking the original bug (if you&#8217;re a programmer, you will recognize this phenomenon!). About half an hour later, I figured out the new bug: I named my test <A href="https://git-scm.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>Git</FONT></A> branch <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">users/soren</CODE>, whereas the previous branch had been named <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</CODE>, and it turns out that the code checking the branch name used the variable <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(Build.SourceBranchName)</CODE>, rather than <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(Build.SourceBranch)</CODE>, which means it discarded everything up through the last slash, yielding just <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">soren</CODE> instead of <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">users/soren</CODE>. If you&#8217;re not a Git expert, this feature is useful because the branch <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</CODE> actually has a longer name, <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">refs/heads/develop</CODE>, and oftentimes you only care about the last part. But in my case, I certainly didn&#8217;t expect <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">users/soren</CODE> to turn into <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">soren</CODE>! I didn&#8217;t even know there <EM>was</EM> a difference between <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SourceBranchName</CODE> and <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SourceBranch</CODE>, because Azure DevOps often has multiple names for the same thing.</P>
<P>Let&#8217;s create some Anki cards so I don&#8217;t get confused by this again.</P>
<P>First, let&#8217;s tackle remembering that these two variables are different things. How to ask this question may not be immediately obvious, however! Our first thought might be to ask something like, &#8220;Are <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(Build.SourceBranch)</CODE> and <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(Build.SourceBranchName)</CODE> different things?&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t generally like <A href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/memory/designing-precise-cards/#questions-should-not-ask-for-yes-or-no-answers"><FONT color=#0066cc>asking yes/no questions</FONT></A>, as I find they aren&#8217;t particularly memorable. We could ask what each of them does, but I know that the two names are similar enough that if all we do is that, it&#8217;s likely I&#8217;ll mix them up repeatedly during reviews, so that&#8217;s not a good idea. Here&#8217;s what I like to do with confusingly similar items: create a card that starts by asserting that they&#8217;re different, then asks what the difference is.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: ADO: What is the difference between <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(Build.SourceBranch)</CODE> and <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(Build.SourceBranchName)</CODE> when using Git?<BR>A: <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(Build.SourceBranchName)</CODE> contains only the portion of the ref name after the final slash.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(I&#8217;ve added a couple of qualifiers: <EM>ADO</EM> makes the card <A href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/memory/designing-precise-cards/#questions-should-be-context-free"><FONT color=#0066cc>context-free</FONT></A> by indicating that it&#8217;s a question about Azure DevOps, and <EM>using Git</EM> is important because the answer is different if we have ADO configured to use a different source-control program.)</P>
<P>This card isn&#8217;t going to be enough by itself, though; while it&#8217;s an important piece of the puzzle, I haven&#8217;t directly tested myself on <A href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/memory/designing-precise-cards/#the-importance-of-asking-the-right-questions"><FONT color=#0066cc>what I want to know</FONT></A>: I want to be able to recognize, when I encounter one of these two variables, that the form <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(Build.SourceBranchName)</CODE> omits part of the branch name, while <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(Build.SourceBranch)</CODE> doesn&#8217;t. Rather than directly asking this question, though, let&#8217;s go for a pair of application questions that puts the knowledge in the context I&#8217;ll be needing it:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: ADO: If you have a Git branch <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</CODE>, what does the variable <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(Build.SourceBranch)</CODE> contain?<BR>A: refs/heads/master</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: ADO: If you have a Git branch <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</CODE>, what does the variable $(Build.SourceBranchName) contain?<BR>A: master</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These questions test the same knowledge. They&#8217;re also more fun and we&#8217;re probably more likely to think about them when the information would be useful in real life, since they focus on a real situation.</P>
<P>One more item worth adding on this topic: if I&#8217;m looking at incorrect code like the code I was staring at today without recognizing the problem, ideally I would notice something&#8217;s off and what the problem is. To reinforce this, I ask what I call &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong with this picture?&#8221; questions:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q: What is wrong with this Azure DevOps template snippet?</P>
<DIV class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<DIV class=highlight><PRE class=highlight><CODE>${{ if eq(variables['Build.SourceBranchName'], 'releases/initech') }}:
    SOURCE_FOLDER: Release
</CODE></PRE></DIV></DIV>
<P>A: <CODE class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(Build.SourceBranchName)</CODE> only contains the portion of the ref name after the last slash, so this will never evaluate true.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And there we have it! I&#8217;m sure there will be something <EM>else</EM> in the way next time, but if I keep adding enough of these questions over time, pretty soon I&#8217;ll be able to solve a lot more problems right away.</P><!-- Include this snippet in your page to use displaymath with $$ eqn $$. --></SECTION><FOOTER class=page__meta>

<H2>10 Rules for Better Flashcards</H2>
<P class=author-name><!-- We explicit that the book was not written by the author of the review --><SPAN>By </SPAN><A href="https://juliensobczak.com/#about-me"><FONT color=#0066cc>Julien Sobczak</FONT></A> </P></DIV></DIV></HEADER><SECTION class=content>
<DIV class="container sticky-container"><ARTICLE>
<DIV class=content>
<DIV class=lead>
<P>I use flashcards a lot. To learn English vocabulary, the grammar, new programming languages, technical jargon, useful commands, and so much more. If I want to retrieve something from memory without going through a Google search, flashcards are my secret weapon since many years. Until now, I created thousands of flashcards manually and even more <A href="https://juliensobczak.com/write/2016/12/26/anki-scripting"><FONT color=#0066cc>programmatically</FONT></A>. While flashcards are simple to create (just a note with a question on the front and the answer on the back), creating effective flashcards may not be obvious at first. By following the rules present in this article, you will avoid most of the errors I made.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="admonitionblock caution license">
<DIV class=content>
<P>Some examples concern programming. If you are not a programmer, don&#8217;t panic, you don&#8217;t need to answer the flashcards to understand the logic behind them and the motivations to rewrite them.</P></DIV></DIV>
<H2 id=more-is-better-than-less>More is better than less</H2>
<P>Creating flashcards takes time, a lot of time. As a consequence, I am often reluctant to add too many flashcards because it&#8217;s just not funny to create them. At the beginning, I was copying whole blocks of text based on books, sometimes even screenshots. It was an easy way to push a lot of content to review. These flashcards are no longer existing in my decks. I have deleted and/or refactored all of them, without any exception.</P>
<H3 id=example>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Which statements compile?</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>List&lt;?&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Dog&gt;();</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>List&lt;? extends Animal&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Dog&gt;();</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>List&lt;?&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;? extends Animal&gt;();</CODE></LI></UL></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>1, 2. You cannot use wildcard notation (?) when creating the instance but only in variable declaration.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="admonitionblock caution license">
<DIV class=title>Note for non-programmers</DIV>
<DIV class=content>
<P>Programs are written in languages that have precise grammar rules, like in English. This flashcard illustrates different syntaxes, some valid and others invalid. A program can only run if the syntax is perfectly valid, unlike English, where someone will understand me even if I make mistakes, probably like in this blog post.</P></DIV></DIV>
<P>This flashcard is based on a quiz present in a certification book and has many flaws:</P>
<UL>
<LI>As it tests different syntax rules, there is not a single answer. You can be right for the first option and wrong for the two last options. A good flashcard should have a unique valid answer. You can&#8217;t be partially right or partially wrong.</LI>
<LI>Consequently, you will need to revise the whole flashcards even if you already know the answer for most of the options, losing precious seconds that can be devoted to more tricky flashcards.</LI></UL>
<H3 id=example-refactored>Example (refactored)</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Valid?</P>
<DIV class=expressive-code><FIGURE class=frame><FIGCAPTION class=header></FIGCAPTION><PRE data-language="plaintext"><CODE><DIV class=ec-line><DIV class=code><SPAN>List&lt;?&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Dog&gt;();</SPAN></DIV></DIV></CODE></PRE>
<DIV class=copy></DIV></FIGURE></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Yes</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Valid?<BR><BR><CODE>List&lt;?&gt; foo = new ArrayList&lt;? extends Animal&gt;();</CODE></P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>False. You cannot use wildcard in instantiation</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Valid?<BR><BR><CODE>List&lt;?&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;? extends Animal&gt;();</CODE></P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Yes</P></DIV>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: By splitting into multiple flashcards, you learn each underlying rule at a different pace (on this example, the 3rd rule is the harder and take more time to assimilate). In this way, you don&#8217;t have to review already assimilated cards, and for each flashcard, either you know the answer or you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s obvious to say if the flashcard was easy or hard.</P>
<H2 id=short-is-better-than-long>Short is better than long</H2>
<P>As a consequence of breaking the first rule, when you avoid creating many small flashcards, you end up with verbose flashcards (particularly for the back card).</P>
<H3 id=example-1>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Give the Git syntax to define commit ranges.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly=""><EM>&#8221;A very long description drawn from the official documentation to explain the numerous different syntaxes. The full content is one-page long and is available <A href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection#_commit_rangesp"><FONT color=#0066cc>here</FONT></A>&#8221;</EM> </DIV>
<DIV class="admonitionblock caution license">
<DIV class=title>Note for non-programmers</DIV>
<DIV class=content>
<P>Git is a program that keep the history of changes you do in a set of files. Programmers use it to keep the history of changes for the source code of a program. After each update, each developer pushes his modifications. Git makes sure there aren&#8217;t two developers who have changed the same code, and records a new commit, a kind of number to identify the changes. Developers can restore a previous state at any time by specifying an old commit.</P></DIV></DIV>
<P>The problem with verbose back card is there is too much information to be able to say with confidence how easy it was to recall. Some of the information is harder to remember, and some of the information does not even deserve to be remembered. The solution is to follow the previous rule <EM>More is better than less</EM>, and split the flashcard into many smaller ones (and also delete the original flashcard, even if it took you a lot of time to create it initially).</P>
<H3 id=example-refactored-1>Example (refactored)</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>What means the Git syntax <CODE>git log master..experiment</CODE>?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>What means the Git syntax <CODE>git log experiment &#8212;not master</CODE>?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>What means the Git syntax <CODE>git log master&#8230;experiment</CODE>?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>How is called this Git syntax <CODE>git log master&#8230;experiment</CODE>?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>What is the difference between <CODE>git log master..experiment</CODE> and <CODE>git log master&#8230;experiment</CODE>?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="admonitionblock caution license">
<DIV class=title>Note for non-programmers</DIV>
<DIV class=content>
<P>Git is mainly used by entering commands on a terminal, even if there exists graphical tools that let you click on buttons to get the same result.</P></DIV></DIV>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: Short flashcards are faster to read, you can revise more cards in the same time, review sessions are more fun because flashcards are really testing you (you know the answer or you don&#8217;t), and often the flashcards are more challenging because you can focus on tricky points, which also increase the satisfaction to learn them.</P>
<DIV class="admonitionblock tip None">
<DIV class=title>Tip</DIV>
<DIV class=content>
<P>A good flashcard (front or back) must fit on your smartphone screen without scrolling (using a 5 inches screen size).</P></DIV></DIV>
<P>For the front card, I avoid long, elaborate, question and favor direct question.</P>
<H3 id=example-2>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>When using the command <CODE>git</CODE>, which option could be used to get the list of possible commands?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>List the <CODE>git</CODE> commands?</P></DIV>
<P>For the back card, I systematically remove all useless words, to make the answer as concise as possible, without losing meaning.</P>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>You can&#8217;t send syslog messages exceeding 1K. True or false?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>The maximum size of a UDP packet is 1K, so this is true in UDP, but only if are not using jumbo packets. On the contrary, this statement is false in TCP because there is not a size limit. Anyway, in both cases, the size is configurable.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Maximum size of a UDP packet, so true in UDP without jumbo packets. False in TCP. In both cases, configurable.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="admonitionblock caution license">
<DIV class=title>Note for non-programmers</DIV>
<DIV class=content>
<P>Software applications send informational messages to record what they do in order to help the developer to debug when problems happen. They are called syslog messages and can be sent to another machine, using various guarantees. For high-traffic applications, you can use UDP to send the messages but they will not be resent if the message is lost in transit. Otherwise, you can use TCP to make sure the message is retransmitted.</P></DIV></DIV>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: The faster to read, the faster to review, but don&#8217;t go to far. You should never have to deduce the question or think hard to understand what the answer means. Write in basic English. No need to be William Shakespeare when writing flashcards.</P>
<H2 id=two-way-is-better-than-one-way>Two-way is better than one-way</H2>
<P>Creating a single flashcard is rarely enough. Learning is more complex. For example, the <A href="https://www.montessoriservices.com/ideas-insights/the-three-period-lesson"><FONT color=#0066cc>three-period lesson</FONT></A>, a hallmark of Montessori education, was devised by the French physician Edouard Seguin, and helps young children learn vocabulary and concepts, following 3 steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Naming</STRONG> (Introduction) &#8220;This is a dog.&#8221;,</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Recognizing</STRONG> (Identification) &#8220;Show me the dog.&#8221;</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Remembering</STRONG> (Cognition) &#8220;What is this?&#8221;</LI></OL>
<P>All 3 steps are important, otherwise you can learn to recognize the dog, but fail to name it when you see it. You have to learn two related but different things. Flashcards are particularly well adapted to this system. For example, Anki can create for you a reversed card to be sure you learn the information in both ways. This model is very useful when learning foreign vocabulary. For example, you may want to recognize the word <EM>voiture</EM> in French texts and be able to translate the English word <EM>car</EM> when speaking French.</P>
<P>When it comes to determine the right number of flashcards to create, context is everything. Sometimes, one flashcard is enough, and sometimes, more than two flashcards are necessary. For example, if you want to read some French books, you can create only flashcards with French words on the front and English translations at the back, but if you want to speak French during your next trip to Paris, you better have to create flashcards with English words (or pictures) on the front, and French translations at the back.</P>
<P>In practice, starting with the right number of flashcards is far from easy. I&#8217;m still failing. When this happens, I recognize my failure and I update my deck to add new flashcards and/or deleting existing ones. Learning is an iterative process.</P>
<H3 id=example-continued>Example (continued)</H3>

<P>This flashcard help me understand the command if I come across it on Internet or on a coworker&#8217;s terminal, but does nothing to help me remember it the day I really need to run it. I learn the information only one way. The solution is to create the reversed flashcard.</P>

<P>This new flashcard is nothing more the definition of the previous command reformulated as a question. You can safely ignore the details.</P></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>What is the causation fallacy in Management?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>The tendency to see the world as a place full of easily explainable events with simple causes and simple effects (financial crisis is caused by bankers, loss of jobs is caused by immigrants,&#8230;) instead of assuming things are more complex than that.</P></DIV>
<P>I often create similar flashcards when I come across a new concept, or a new jargon. This way, when I see the expression cited again, I already know the meaning and are not diverted by it, and so, I can read more advanced book on the subject. The problem is that if you give me the definition, the name will only be on the tip of my tongue. I need the reversed card to fully learn it.</P>

<P>The causation fallacy</P></DIV>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: Flashcards should reflect the ways you will use the information. Create as many flashcards as necessary to prevent the tip of the tongue phenomenon.</P>
<H2 id=specific-is-better-than-general>Specific is better than general</H2>
<P>As said before, a flashcard should have a unique valid answer. You should never ask yourself if you answered correctly or not.</P>
<H3 id=example-agile>Example: (Agile)</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>What is the Five W&#8217;s method?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Asks Who? Why? What? Where? When? (and sometimes How?)<BR>This method helps grasp a problem definition.</P></DIV>
<P>The flashcard is short but you don&#8217;t really understand what is expected. There are many valid answers with such a general question. The solution is again to use the <EM>More is better than less</EM> rule to replace the flashcard with more specific ones:</P>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">

<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>To help grasp a problem definition.</P></DIV>
<P>A good way to make flashcards more specific is to use cloze deletions. Cloze deletion is the process of hiding one or more words in a sentence. These flashcards are sometimes called fill-in-the-blank flashcards.</P>
<H3 id=example-4>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Which proposition to use after <EM>write a letter</EM>?</P></DIV>
<P>Using cloze deletion, we can rephrase the flashcard like this:</P>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>I write a letter <STRONG>___</STRONG> a friend.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>I write a letter <STRONG>to</STRONG> friend.</P></DIV>
<H3 id=example-5>Example</H3>
<P>In practice, there are often several valid ways to create a flashcard. Let&#8217;s reuse the example from the rule <EM>Two-way is better than one-way</EM>:</P>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>How is called the tendency to see the world as a place full of easily explainable events with simple causes and simple effects?</P></DIV>
<P>The flashcard can be rewritten to use cloze deletion:</P>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>The tendency to see the world as a place full of easily explainable events with simple causes and simple effects is called <STRONG>___</STRONG>.</P></DIV>
<P>Or</P>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>The <STRONG>___</STRONG> describes the tendency to see the world as a place full of easily explainable events with simple causes and simple effects.</P></DIV>
<P>Personally, I was using cloze deletion parsimoniously at the beginning, but now, I use them massively as I found them quickly to answer.</P>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: fill-in-the-blank flashcards make the question crystal clear and make sure the answer is specific. When the answer is displayed, there is no possible doubt.</P>
<DIV class="admonitionblock tip None">
<DIV class=title>Tip</DIV>
<DIV class=content>
<P>Anki provides native support for cloze deletion. Check the <A href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#cloze-deletion"><FONT color=#0066cc>manual</FONT></A>.</P></DIV></DIV>
<H2 id=opened-is-better-than-closed>Opened is better than closed</H2>
<P>Answering <EM>yes</EM> or <EM>no</EM> to a flashcards is not optimal, and very often, you&#8217;d better rewrite the flashcard to ask for a more elaborate answer.</P>
<H3 id=example-6>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Are bzip2 files splittable?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Yes</P></DIV>
<DIV class="admonitionblock caution license">
<DIV class=title>Note for non-programmers</DIV>
<DIV class=content>
<P>A file is splittable if you can read only a part of it without having to read the full content. Not all file formats are splittable. For example, you need to uncompress a zip file entirely even to read a single file present in the archive.</P></DIV></DIV>
<P>The problem with flashcards like those is you are not learning really practical information. Being able to answer <EM>yes</EM> or <EM>no</EM> is not going to take you very far. Compare with this flashcard:</P>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Why bzip2 files are splittable?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>bzip2 contains a list of independently compressed blocks. You can uncompress only the block that contains the file you are looking for.</P></DIV>
<P>If you can answer this flashcard, you know for sure if the bzip2 format is splittable or not, and you can also explain why.</P>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: Flashcards asking for closed questions are not funny. Open questions helps you learn a little more, and overall, can make a great difference. But don&#8217;t be too general&#8230; (see the rule <EM>Specific is better than general</EM>).</P>
<H2 id=subtle-is-better-than-obvious>Subtle is better than obvious</H2>
<P>A flashcard should never be too obvious, otherwise, you will answer correctly but fails to really learn the fact behind it. The solution is to formulate the question in a way that does not influence the answer (in practice, being subtle is far from being obvious).</P>
<H3 id=example-7>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Does the word &#8220;shrimp&#8221; have a plural form?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>No. The word &#8220;shrimp&#8221; can be used in the singular and plural forms.</P></DIV>
<P>The question gives a clue that it may not be a plural form. Compare with this alternative:</P>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>What is the plural form of the word &#8220;shrimp&#8221;?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>No plural form. The word &#8220;shrimp&#8221; could be used in the singular and plural forms.</P></DIV>
<P>The answer is still the same, but with this reformulation, you are influenced to find a solution while there isn&#8217;t. You will answer correctly only if you are sure that the word <EM>shrimp</EM> can be used in singular and plural forms. In this way, you test your knowledge, and not your capacity to suppose the answer.</P>
<P>To follow the rule <EM>More is Better Than Less</EM>, you&#8217;d better create complementary flashcards with noun that have a plural form (&#8220;What is the plural form of the word <EM>fox</EM>?&#8221;), even if that is the nominal case. Otherwise, if you only create flashcards for exceptions, you will learn to recognize these flashcards and be able to answer correctly without paying notice to the question (&#8220;Oh yes, I remember some words don&#8217;t have a plural form, the answer is <EM>No</EM>&#8221;). By introducing variations, you are required to consider the word (shrimp, fox) to answer (&#8220;Oh yes, I remember some words don&#8217;t have a plural form, what about <EM>shrimp</EM>?&#8221;).</P>
<H3 id=example-8>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>Spot the error<BR><BR><EM>She never wears hat.</EM></P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P><EM>She never wears <STRONG>a</STRONG> hat</EM>.</P></DIV>
<P>This flashcard seems not so easy at first. There is no clue to find the answer. But with time, you will learn to recognize the sentence and be able to find where the error is. The day you need to write a similar sentence, however, you will probably hesitate between the two options. Indeed, you learned to recognize the error but failed to learn the rule. Compare with this alternative:</P>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly=""><EM>She never wears <STRONG>[&#8709;/a]</STRONG> hat.</EM> </DIV>
<P>The solution is still the same but this flashcard force you to consider the rule. You can&#8217;t just learn to recognize where the error is located. You need to know the rule to answer the question. This flashcard seems less subtle than the first version because we mark explicitly where the problem is, but by providing the two possible options, you make the rule explicit.</P>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: Make sure to learn the rule and not just to detect the error. When you know the rule, you are able to spot errors. The reverse is not true.</P>
<H2 id=mixed-is-better-than-to-much-organized>Mixed is better than (to much) organized</H2>
<P>Flashcards should be organized. You cannot just put every flashcard on a big box and revise them together. You probably don&#8217;t want to chain &#8220;How to say hello in French?&#8221;, &#8220;What is the Linux command to check available disk space?&#8221;, &#8220;What is the capital of Japan?&#8220;. Even if our brain is organized as a giant network of interconnected neurons, sometimes, a little organization is welcome. Anki lets you group your flashcards in several decks to revise them independently (French, Geography, Capitals). But too much separation is not necessarily a good thing to me:</P>
<UL>
<LI>It&#8217;s hard a review a large number of decks each day. You will not have new cards every day for each deck, and as soon as a deck fails to get new cards to learn, it loses some interest (learning is funnier than revising).</LI>
<LI>Our brain has a wonderful aptitude to bring together unrelated information to create new ideas. Reviewing each subject separately go against it and by doing so, you lose one of the main benefits of flashcards. There are, however, subjects that are best kept separated. If you aspire to become a polyglot, I&#8217;m not sure mixing vocabulary for French, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Danish will be profitable (but I may be wrong). This can create confusion and slows down your progression. On the contrary, interspersing Unix, Git, Emacs, VS Code commands will help you see the similarities (e.g., Bash uses Emacs shortcuts, Git follow X-Style for arguments, etc.). You will not just learn facts, you will understand the rules behind them.</LI></UL>
<P>In practice, I limit myself to a few decks whose name should be very general: <EM>English</EM> for everything about the English language, <EM>Programming</EM> for everything related to my job of developer, even if that&#8217;s not code, <EM>General</EM> for everything else such as capitals, history, geography. But If you are enthusiast about history and create a lot of flashcards about it, you will probably need a deck only for history. In short, it depends.</P>
<H3 id=example-9>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-deck flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<UL>
<LI>English vocabulary</LI>
<LI>English idioms</LI>
<LI>English grammar</LI>
<LI>English slangs</LI>
<LI>Capitals</LI>
<LI>Countries</LI>
<LI>Seas</LI></UL></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-deck flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<UL>
<LI>English</LI>
<LI>Geography</LI></UL></DIV>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: Group flashcards according their topic and not their type. When you speak English, you need to know the grammar, some vocabulary, and maybe a few idioms. Everything is related and that should be reflected into your decks. Organize the information in the same way that you are using it (when programming, you are editing some code in your text editor using shortcuts, you are committing your changes using Git commands from a Linux terminal).</P>
<DIV class="admonitionblock tip None">
<DIV class=title>Tip</DIV>
<DIV class=content>
<P>With Anki, I use tags to annotate the flashcards with the categories where they belong (vocabulary, grammar, idiom, country, capital, etc). This is very useful when you want to review, for example, only the English grammar. Anki lets you create filtered decks using these tags (<CODE>deck:English tag:grammar</CODE>).</P></DIV></DIV>
<H2 id=random-is-better-than-linear>Random is better than linear</H2>
<P>School often forces us to learn foreign vocabulary by topic. Most vocabulary books and online lessons are also organized like that. But should we learn all the vegetables before the means of transportation? Or the reverse? I would like to see you get off the plane at Paris airport, knowing how to say cucumber in French, but not knowing how to ask for help or a taxi. In the same way, I&#8217;m not sure knowing how to say a horse carriage in French will be useful to decipher the main ingredients on a French menu at a local restaurant.</P>
<P>An alternative that I have found more effective in practice is to learn the vocabulary according their frequency. There exist frequency dictionaries published as books or available online. This way, you will quickly know about car, bus, train, salad, carrot, and only after you have mastered the basic vocabulary, you will heard about hoverboard, turnip, etc.</P>
<P>This applies not just for vocabulary. You probably don&#8217;t want to learn all the vocabulary before learning the grammar, and only then the slangs and idioms. Or you don&#8217;t want to learn all Git commands before learning all Linux commands, and only then the shortcuts of your favorite text editor. Mixing up is more appropriate. Learn the basic Git commands, the basic Linux commands, the most useful shortcuts. Then, learn advanced Git commands, less widespread Linux options, etc.</P>
<P>In practice, I make sure to add flashcards at the appropriate time. I added the first thousand most common English words, and only after, the next thousand words, and so on. I added the most Git useful commands after reading an introductory book, and only after, I completed the list by reading a more authoritative book on the subject.</P>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: As said before, our brain is not a perfectly organized warehouse but a giant mess of interconnected neurons. Injecting a little randomness into your decks reflects the complex nature of your brain. This rule is complementary to the previous rule <EM>Mixed is better than organized</EM>.</P>
<H2 id=stylized-is-better-than-unstyled>Stylized is better than unstyled</H2>
<P>Flashcards doesn&#8217;t have to be just plain text. There are many ways to enrich them in order to make them more easier to learn. Here are a few tricks I use.</P>
<H3 id=tag-to-add-context>Tag to add context</H3>
<P>When mixing various cards into the same deck (see rule <EM>Mixed is better than organized</EM>), a small hint can be useful to quickly grasp what we are talking about. For example, you can use tags in Anki to distinguish the subjects inside the same deck, but Anki doesn&#8217;t display them when reviewing. As a workaround, I prepend all my flashcards with the tag.</P>
<H3 id=example-10>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>What are the conventions of a test in Go?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>(Go) What are the conventions of a test?</P></DIV>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: By systematically prepending/appending the tag/category, you don&#8217;t have to look for a clue in the question to get the context. You are directly focused on the question to answer.</P>
<H3 id=emphaze-to-highlight-keywords>Emphaze to highlight keywords</H3>
<P>As explained by the rule <EM>Short is better than long</EM>, flashcards should be as short as possible. Another solution to shorten the time required to read the question is to highlight some keywords. The first time you review the flashcard, you will need to read the full content but with successive reviews, you will start recognizing the question, just by seeing the keywords.</P>
<H3 id=example-11>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>(Go) The order of declarations (var, const, type, func) is important?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>(Go) The <STRONG>order of declarations</STRONG> (<CODE>var</CODE>, <CODE>const</CODE>, <CODE>type</CODE>, <CODE>func</CODE>) is <STRONG>important</STRONG>?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="admonitionblock note undefined">
<DIV class=content>
<P>You can use different fonts when appropriate. I use a <CODE>monospace</CODE> font for every programming keywords or command names.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>(General) Difference between UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32?</P></DIV>

<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: Revisions are more effective since you lose less time reading the cards.</P>
<P>I also use highlighting on the back cards to make the expected answer explicit.</P>
<H3 id=example-12>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>(Math) What is a bogus proof?</P></DIV>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-back flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">

<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ok" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">
<P>(Math) What is a <STRONG>bogus proof</STRONG>?</P></DIV>

<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: You only need to read highlighted text to check your answer. If you&#8217;re wrong, read the remaining of the text to get additional explanations (but keep the card short).</P>
<H3 id=colorize-to-create-patterns>Colorize to create patterns</H3>
<P>When learning a foreign language, you are constantly switching between two languages: How do you say <EM>car</EM> in French? What means <EM>voiture</EM>? To differentiate between these languages, I colorize each foreign word with the same color.</P>
<H3 id=example-13>Example</H3>
<DIV class="flashcard flashcard-front flashcard-ko" data-astro-cid-pkg26fly="">

<DIV class=content>
<P>Anki also supports animated pictures (e.g., gif files). Very useful to animate some diagrams but keep the animation very short and the diagram not too complex. You don&#8217;t want to watch a video while reviewing your flashcards.</P></DIV></DIV>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: Learn the information using the best media. Sometimes, a small diagram or a sketchnote is all you need to get the idea. The simpler, the more effective.</P>
<H2 id=custom-is-better-than-shared>Custom is better than shared</H2>
<P>As said before, creating flashcards is not the most rewarding task. It sucks even when you knows the efficiency of flashcards. So, why not using shared flashcard collections. Anki offers <A href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/"><FONT color=#0066cc>shared decks</FONT></A>, and there are numerous applications that was created the last years based on the spaced repetition system. For example, you can learn vocabulary with Memrise, and the grammar with Duolingo.</P>
<P>On the Internet, you will find numerous discussions about using those specialized (and often subscription-based) apps over using generalized applications like Anki. Personally, I tried these applications some years ago. I was using Memrise a lot at first, until I finally choose the centralized approach of using only one application, Anki. The reasons are numerous:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>Learning is too crucial to depend on proprietary applications, which need viable business plans to subsist (a flashcard required several years to be really assimilated, I don&#8217;t want to reprocess the same cards tomorrow with another application). Using an OSS solution like Anki get you full control of your data. I wrote a <A href="https://juliensobczak.com/write/2016/12/26/anki-scripting"><FONT color=#0066cc>blog post</FONT></A> about how to export them in HTML just for the demo. Besides, with Anki, all your data resides on your disk. Ankiweb is used to synchronise them between your different devices (a small inconvenience compared to cloud based products that synchronize everything transparently).</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>As outlined in the rule <EM>Random is better than linear</EM>, you may want to learn the French vocabulary during the same review session as the French grammar. Using specialized apps, you have to switch between different applications. Making an habit is hard enough to not throw to many applications at it. Furthermore, there isn&#8217;t an existing application for everything you want to learn&#8230;</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>With Anki, I decide what I really want and need to learn. When using Memrise, you are limited to existing collections (e.g., 4000 words for an educated vocabulary, 500 most common words) What if you want to learn the 5000 most frequent words? You don&#8217;t control what you really learn, and this is, in my opinion, unacceptable (despite I found these apps very great with their clean interface and rich user experience).</P></LI></UL>
<P>Nevertheless, some subjects like vocabulary makes good candidates for sharing (look at Anki shared decks, the majority concerns foreign languages). Use them with caution to get started or if you have no plan to get really far in this particular language. Otherwise, adapt them to fit your own workflow (change the flashcard style, import them into the same deck, complete them with new cards, etc).</P>
<P><STRONG>Advantage</STRONG> &#55357;&#56397;: Creating custom flashcards is the best way to stay in control of what you learn. The only downside is it requires time, a lot of time, but remember we lay the first stone of learning when we are creating them in the first place.</P>
<H2 id=afterword>Afterword</H2>
<P>As there isn&#8217;t a unique way of learning, there shouldn&#8217;t be a unique way to create flashcards. In this post, I have tried to expose what I learned from the numerous mistakes I made. There are surely more mistakes I will do. So, try what makes sense to you and experiment by yourself.</P>
