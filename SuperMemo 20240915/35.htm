First, there is the <I>Income Statement</I> : The income statement tells us how much money the company earned during a set period of time. The company&#8217;s accountants traditionally generate income statements for shareholders to see for each three-month period during the fiscal year and for the whole fiscal year. Using the company&#8217;s income statement, Warren can determine such things as the company&#8217;s margins, its return equity, and, most important, the consistency and direction of its earnings. All of these factors are necessary in determining whether the company is benefiting from a durable competitive advantage.

<P class=indent>The second flavor is the <I>Balance Sheet</I> : The balance sheet tells us how much money the company has in the bank and how much money it owes. Subtract the money owed from the money in the bank and we get the net worth of the company. A company can create a balance sheet for any given day of the year, which will show what it owns, what it owes, and its net worth for that particular day.</P>
<P class=indent>Traditionally, companies generate a balance sheet for shareholders to see at the end of each three-month period of time (called quarter) and at the end of the accounting or fiscal year. Warren has learned to use some of the entries on the balance sheet&#8212;such as the amount of cash the company has or the amount of long-term debt it carries&#8212;as indicators of the presence of a durable competitive advantage.

Third, there is the <I>Cash Flow Statement</I> : The cash flow statement tracks the cash that flows in and out of the business. The cash flow statement is good for seeing how much money the company is spending on capital improvements. It also tracks bond and stock sales and repurchases. A company will usually issue a cash flow statement along with its other financial statements.
