There are two types of debt: lines of credit and term debt. For entrepreneurs, credit lines are the equivalent of crack cocaine&#8212;it&#8217;s that addictive. Why? Because when you draw money on a line of credit, you&#8217;ve postponed a hard business decision that should have been made a lot sooner. Sometimes people would rather exhaust their resources than make the hard decisions.

I don&#8217;t want you to have anything drawn on your line of credit. If you can be debt free, I&#8217;m all for it. But I know there are things you need. For instance, if you need a vehicle for work and you want to buy a Mercedes, I&#8217;m not wild about that. But at least it&#8217;s financed with term debt (a fixed monthly payment over specific period of time) and you can depreciate the cost over the life of the asset (and we consider it part of your market-based wage calculation).

If a new piece of equipment is absolutely essential to the production of the business, I&#8217;d rather you pay cash for it. But if you need to buy a piece of production equipment and you know how much productivity and sales you&#8217;ll get from it, go ahead and finance the equipment with term debt. You will have to remain profitable to retire that debt since you can repay debt only with after-tax profits. If you have to buy a building, that&#8217;s obviously difficult to buy on a cash basis, but at least it&#8217;s financed with term debt.
