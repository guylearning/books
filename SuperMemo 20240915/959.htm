<P class=indent>One of the things I do when I sit down with owners of million-dollar businesses is ask them to put the responsible person&#8217;s name beside these eight functional areas:</P></A>
<OL class=olist><A id=page_24>
<LI class=nl>CEO: In most cases, the CEO is the owner, but you may want to hire one if you are not the best fit. 
<LI class=nl>Sales: Sales management is the key function, more so than who actually does the selling.</A> 
<LI class=nl><A id=page_24>Marketing: I make a distinct differentiation between sales and <A id=page_25>marketing; they are two different functional areas. The same person may be doing both jobs, but they&#8217;re not the same job.</A><A id=page_25> 
<LI class=nl>Operations: This is the person who makes sure that the trains run on time and that whatever product or service you&#8217;re selling gets delivered. 
<LI class=nl>IT and technology development: You need somebody to take care of information technology capabilities. These days, everybody needs some IT in their cupboard. You might outsource it, but somebody needs to own that function. 
<LI class=nl>Finance: Somebody has to pay the bills, balance the checkbook, and do basic financial reporting. You can outsource part of it, but someone in the company has to be responsible for it. 
<LI class=nl>Customer service: Who&#8217;s the customer service advocate? There is an overlap between sales and operations in meeting your customer expectations. Someone needs to bridge these two areas to make sure the customer is getting what you say you are selling. 
<LI class=nl>HR functions: There are paperwork functions in human resources that need to be handled, but as you get larger, someone has to make sure the company mission and values connects with the employees. This has to be tied into the development of your culture and your appraisal processes.</A></LI></OL><A id=page_25>
<P class=indent>Time and time again, in a single-shareholder business, the owner takes care of all these functional areas except for one or two undesirable things, which are outsourced to a contractor or delegated to an employee. When there are two shareholders, there is more of a balance between them in terms of jobs and wearing hats. But the bottom line is that when you hit a million dollars in revenue, you have to think about these things.</P></A>
