As you grow from $1 million to $5 million in revenue, you are going to hit some badlands, and you are going to need some resources. The most important resource you will need is extra manpower. It doesn&#8217;t matter what business you&#8217;re in. You have to take care of those eight functional areas no matter what size your business is.

It would be nice if we could all find a business that makes a lot of profit and comes without employee and customer headaches. But that&#8217;s not realistic. To get through these challenges, you need to prepare your wagon train and have the right provisions. That means you have to hire people with the right skill sets to make the journey with you, and you have to pay them a market-based wage. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re not going to get through the Badlands in one piece.

You have to understand that people are going to change and that one of the keys to success is continually upgrading your staff.
