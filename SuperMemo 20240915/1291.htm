<P class=noindent><A id=page_28>Here&#8217;s what I always tell people: hire slowly, fire quickly. I&#8217;m a big fan of the topgrading concept of hiring when it comes to interviewing and selecting candidates. I strongly encourage my clients to read <SPAN class=cmitalic>Topgrading: How Leading Companies Win by Hiring, Coaching, and Keeping the Best People</SPAN> by Bradford D. Smart (Portfolio, 2005) to understand the process. I also highly encourage the use of personality profiles as part of the screening process so you understand what makes that person tick. I have tried many different profiles, but I prefer the Caliper Profile from Caliper Human Strategies (<A href="http://www.calipercorp.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>www.calipercorp.com</FONT></A>).

A lot of growing businesses want to hire someone who has &#8220;been there, done that&#8221; credentials, but my clients have the least success with this approach. In fact, only about one out of ten has been successful. There are times you must hire experience, for instance, if you need to hire someone to lead your IT department. But usually you need to ask <A id=page_29>yourself why the &#8220;been there, done that&#8221; person is available. You&#8217;ll always get a story to explain it, but do your homework to find the real reason because it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;re not getting the full story.</A>

Recently, I was very fortunate to take advantage of a two-day plant tour and program at Dell, the computer manufacturer. I spent a full day with Dell executives, and they said quite a few of their executives were first hired as consultants. This gave the company a chance to get to know them. If Dell decided they wanted to work long-term with a consultant, they hired the person as a full-time executive. This strikes me as a very wise approach for executive-level talent. It gives you time to make sure the consultants don&#8217;t have just two ideas they continually repeat; better yet, you don&#8217;t end up paying over and over again for the same two ideas.

Another successful approach is hiring young talent and investing in their education. In fact, at my firm we like to hire people straight out of college. They don&#8217;t know a lot about anything when they come out of college, but they also do not have any baggage to unlearn. I like having the responsibility to fill their heads full of things I want them to know. A lot of my clients have had their greatest success with young talent who bought into the vision and the dream for the company. These young people are like sponges, and they want to absorb knowledge and information.

You may find the greatest person in the world, but maybe that person isn&#8217;t right for the role you&#8217;re hiring for. Too often employers want to attach a bad outcome to a specific person. But actually the employer is probably to blame, because he hired the wrong person for the job. I&#8217;ve found that most of the people who have gone through my business, as well as many others, go on to find great, happy, and successful careers at other places. They just weren&#8217;t the right fit for my business. The goal is to make sure you don&#8217;t use a trial-and-error approach to hiring. When you hire someone, you want it to be an informed decision.
