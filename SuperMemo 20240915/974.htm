The next force of cash flow is reaching your core capital target. Recall from our earlier discussion that your core capital target is two months of operating expenses in cash and nothing drawn on a line of credit. One of my clients develops software, and when the company has good contracts they do well, but when they don&#8217;t have contracts they have very severe cash-flow problems. Their core capital target is six months of operating expenses. You have to pick the number you&#8217;re comfortable with.

<P class=indent>Let&#8217;s go back to our example in exhibit 4.3. This business had an average of $200,000 per month in operating expenses. It is no coincidence that their largest downstrokes in cash flow were approximately $400,000, or two months of operating expenses. There are very few exceptions to this and, unfortunately, very few businesses are above zero for the core capital calculation.</P>
<P class=indent>Remember, history is the best predictor of the future. You just need to look back and decide if there&#8217;s anything you can do to keep that down-stroke happening again. There&#8217;s usually nothing you can do to prevent it, but what you <SPAN class=cmitalic>can</SPAN> do differently next time is have cash available to cover the downstroke. This way, you can fund that deepest downstroke instead of drawing on your credit line to cover it.

<P class=indent><A id=page_62>Businesses that have cash and no debt attract magical things. The opportunities that fall into their laps are just amazing. One of my former partners had a client who was in the building supply business. The client was an old-timer who never had any debt and always had over a million dollars in the bank. We were talking to him one day and he said, &#8220;I love a recession!&#8221; We were stunned. He continued, &#8220;I love a recession <A id=page_63>because I&#8217;ve got cash and I can buy stuff cheaper than anybody because they know that I can pay it. I can work the deals while all my competitors go out of business. I&#8217;m the only game in town because I saved my money and they didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</A>
