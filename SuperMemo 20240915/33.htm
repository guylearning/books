<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>B</SPAN>efore we start looking for the company that will make us rich, which is a company with a durable competitive advantage, it helps if we know where to look.

Warren likes to think of these companies as owning a piece of the consumer&#8217;s mind, and when a company owns a piece of the consumer&#8217;s mind, it never has to change its products, which, as you will find out, is a good thing. The company also gets to charge higher prices and sell more of its products, creating all kinds of wonderful economic events that show up on the company&#8217;s financial statements.
