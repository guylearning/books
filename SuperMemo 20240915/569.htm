<P class=noindent>Once you get past $5 million in revenue, these same principles apply, just with larger numbers. Hopefully, you have developed a team of people to support you in the process. Entrepreneurs who get past $5 million and continue to survive do so because they have great instincts. Some of my clients have phenomenal instincts, and I think one of the reasons they like working with me is that I help them verbalize what they already instinctively know. They just need someone to observe what they&#8217;ve done and connect the dots.</P>
<P class=indent>When it comes to profitability, you have to balance these ideas. But if you don&#8217;t get the owner compensation right, your profit number will be distorted. That distortion decreases as you approach $20 million or $30 million in revenue. But when owners are at $5 million or less in revenue and play games with their compensation, they&#8217;re messing up the data that could tell them how healthy their business is. For example, if everything you buy at Sam&#8217;s Club goes into a business account even though it&#8217;s groceries, your books don&#8217;t really mean anything.
