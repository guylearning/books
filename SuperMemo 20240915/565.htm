<P>These three items are deducted from EBIT in the &#8216;profit and loss account&#8217;. They represent a distribution of most of the profit earned for the period. Possibly 75 percent of the profit in any year goes out under these headings, to leave approximately 25 percent that is permanently retained in the business.</P>
<P>Therefore we expect cash flow to remain positive even after these charges. Furthermore, as regards timing, the profit is realized in cash well ahead of these out-flows. So this first set of payments should not, of themselves, be a cause of cash embarrassment.

<P>These can be substantial in amount. They are also deducted from after-tax income and are in no way connected with the profit for the period. Therefore they can give rise to heavily negative cash positions. However, the amounts required are known well in advance and, in most situations, can be planned and provided for.

<P>This final item is nearly always a matter of policy. It can probably be deferred in unfavorable circumstances. It is subjected to much thought, analysis and planning. Nevertheless heavy expenditure on projects that do not perform to plan is one of the major causes of cash difficulties.
