<P class=noindent>Company B took the best approach. Take a look at exhibit 3.2.</P>
<P class=indent>They started off below $2 million in revenue, and they were profitable right out of the gate. You can see that they built equity at a nice pace by being profitable and, unlike Company A, they maintained profitability as their revenue went up. Their pretax profit slowed a little bit, but other than minimal amounts they had to pay in taxes, they kept that profit in the business in the first three years.</P></A>
<P class=indent><A id=page_37>Notice that there is a flat year from Year 2 to Year 3. When businesses have early success, they sometimes think they have reached a pinnacle and believe they&#8217;re as big as they&#8217;re ever going to get, so they just put <A id=page_38>their head down and stop thinking about growth. Notice that Company B&#8217;s pretax profit goes down between Year 2 and Year 3. This is because they hired more people to relieve some of the pressure created by the growth of the business.</A></P><A id=page_38>
<P class=indent>The company stayed within the target of 10 percent to 15 percent pretax profit. In Year 2 they were closer to 15 percent, and in Year 3 they dropped back to about 12 percent. This isn&#8217;t a bad profit, but it&#8217;s allowing what I call <SPAN class=cmitalic>cost creep</SPAN>. And a significant component of cost creep is <SPAN class=cmitalic>labor creep</SPAN>, which is the biggest profit sucker out there. You&#8217;re doing all those little jobs and you start thinking, &#8220;Gee, I really don&#8217;t like doing that. Let&#8217;s hire somebody else to do that.&#8221; We all have details we don&#8217;t want to take care of. I have four kids and I changed a lot of diapers, but after I got through the first couple, I kind of got over it. Realistically, to have proper labor efficiency you have to make sure that the annoying tasks are distributed to everybody in the company. Labor creep is one of the most common ailments I see. It causes a lot of black hole struggles.</P>
<P class=indent>Look at the Distributions line on exhibit 3.2. Notice that Company A doesn&#8217;t have a distributions line on their graph because they had no distributions. Their profitability is below 5 percent, which is really close to zero. In Company B, the distributions in the first three years reflect only tax distributions because they listened to what I told them. They&#8217;re building the business, and until they reached their target equity levels, they left that money in the business.</P>
<P class=indent>Between Year 4 and Year 5 there is a jump in the distribution level. That&#8217;s a serious change because I identified that the equity level at the beginning of Year 4 was the base equity they needed to maintain. They didn&#8217;t need to hold the profits in the company any longer, so they distributed them between Year 4 and Year 5. By the way, the owners of Company B were being paid a market-based wage, so these are <SPAN class=cmitalic>real</SPAN> profit numbers over and above market-based wages.</P></A>

<P class=noindent><A id=page_38>See the difference between Company A and Company B? Company A took the typical route of not being profitable before they tried to <A id=page_39>grow to $5 million. They did not get the necessary productivity of labor to have profit along the way. Company B followed my advice of staying above 10 percent pretax profit at every step along the way and took distributions only to cover taxes until they had nothing drawn on their line of credit and two months of operating expenses in cash. How did Company B remain profitable every year? They did not add labor until the last possible moment, and the owners, along with their management responsibilities, were still productive in the business.</A>
