There has been a lot of effort put into finding out the regularities in the process of learning. As a result, effective algorithms have been developed that are able to quickly determine the best possible interval for an item independent of its difficulty and the number of earlier repetitions. Those algorithms have been implemented as a computer program known as SuperMemo (available for <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/which.htm">Windows, Android, iPhone</A>, etc.).

This is done by scheduling repetitions in carefully determined intervals of time called optimum intervals<A href="https://super-memory.com/english/princip.htm#optimal_intervals"><SUP>2</SUP></A>. These optimum intervals are calculated on the basis of two contradictory criteria: 
<OL>
<LI>Intervals should be as long as possible to obtain the minimum frequency of repetitions, and to make the best use of the so-called spacing effect<A href="https://super-memory.com/english/princip.htm#spacing_effect"><SUP>3</SUP></A>, which says that longer inter-repetition intervals, up to a certain limit, produce stronger memories 
<LI>Intervals should be short enough to ensure that the knowledge is still remembered</LI></OL>
<P>In practice, these two criteria translate into the following one: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Intervals should be as long as it is necessary for a selected small proportion of knowledge be forgotten</B>. This proportion (called the <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/g.htm#forgetting_index"><EM>forgetting index</EM></A>) can vary from 3% (for slower and very exact learning) to 20% (for faster learning characterized by a low retention of knowledge)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

The speed of learning depends on the way you represent knowledge (i.e. the way in which you formulate the studied material). Optimization of repetitions is a separate problem and the statement <EM>SuperMemo will let you learn at the highest possible speed</EM>, should be understood as <EM>SuperMemo will let you learn at the highest speed for the given material, your mental characteristics and your general conditions for learning</EM>. Knowledge representation is so important that the difference in time used for repetitions may easily reach 1:100 ratio!!! The simplest rules of knowledge representation: keep it simple, make it interesting, and use mnemonic techniques (i.e. use pictorial representation, vivid examples, metaphors, comparisons, <A href="http://www.mindman.com/">mind maps</A>, etc.).
