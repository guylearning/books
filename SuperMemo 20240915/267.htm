The <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>knowledge structuring tricks</FONT></A> will certainly introduce redundancy, but a clever student will certainly use the redundancy to his or her advantage. Monster items consume more time and produce less effect than the same items split into a number of subitems. To ensure good recall, a multifaceted approach should be taken, i.e. all possible combinations of questions concerning a given relationship should be asked. For example, if you want to remember that the leading cause of death is heart disease, and that it accounts for almost 40% of deaths in western countries, the following question might appear insufficient:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>What is the leading cause of death in western countries?</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>However, the above question does not let you remember the proportion of deaths caused by heart disease, nor does it ensure that the 40% statistic refers to western countries. Instead, a multifaceted set of questions could look as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI><I>What is the leading cause of death in western countries?</I> 
<LI><I>In what group of countries is heart disease a leading cause of death?</I> 
<LI><I>What proportion of deaths in western countries can be attributed to heart disease?</I> 
<LI><I>What disease is responsible for 40% of deaths in western countries?</I> 
<LI><I>Is heart disease a leading cause of death in western countries?</I></LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Such a collection of items, although redundant and time-consuming, will be learned faster and will leave a more stable trace in your memory
