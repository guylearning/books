90% of students start their affair with SuperMemo because of good opinions they heard about the program from their colleagues or from press (recently, more and more customers are attracted to SuperMemo via the Internet). That initial attitude is positive and full of expectation.

Only 75% of individuals continue their repetitions beyond one month! The drop-outs provide the following reasons for cessation of repetitions: (1) they do not believe in SuperMemo (10%)(no university education or education in humanities prevails), (2) they do not believe in their own learning powers (5%)(mostly individuals over 45 years of age), (3) they do not have time for repetitions (25%)(private entrepreneurs, physicians, lawyers, etc.), and (4) they intend to return to repetitions in the future (60%)(students). Only those who pass the first month of repetitions can truly testify to the usefulness of the method. Among those the approval rate is 95%! Most of them consider SuperMemo an excellent aid in learning (50%) or a useful product (45%); only 5% of those polled did not have a specified opinion or rated SuperMemo as nothing special.

Here, the major drawback of SuperMemo becomes visible: it does not produce amazing results for free! It does produce amazing results only through hard and systematic work. In busy times of our dynamically growing civilization, we all too often stick with the principle that better an egg today than a hen tomorrow. 10 minutes spent on a business call, reading a scientific paper, or writing a report seem to bring immediate result. The same 10 minutes spent on repetitions with SuperMemo, can save several hours or even days in lifetime, but the saving is hard to sense, even for an experienced student. <B>SuperMemo is a gratification delayed!</B>
