Business ratios are the guiding stars for the management of enterprises; they provide their targets and standards. They are helpful to managers in directing them towards the most beneficial long-term strategies as well as towards effective short-term decision-making. 
<P></P>
<P>Conditions in any business operation change day by day and, in this dynamic situation, the ratios inform management about the most important issues requiring their immediate attention. By definition the ratios show the connections that exist between different parts of the business. They highlight the important interrelationships and the need for a proper balance between departments. A knowledge of the main ratios, therefore, will enable managers of different functions to work more easily together towards overall business objectives.</P>
<P>The common language of business is finance. Therefore, the most important ratios are those that are financially based. The manager will, of course, understand that the financial numbers are only a <SPAN class=emphasis><EM>reflection</EM></SPAN> of what is actually happening and that it is the <SPAN class=emphasis><EM>reality</EM></SPAN> not the ratios that must be managed.

<P>Managers operating in today&#8217;s ever more complex world have to assimilate more and more of its rules. They must absorb a lot of information quickly. They need effective methods of communication.

The approach taken in this book is to ignore many ratios initially in order to concentrate on the few that are vital. These few, perhaps 20 in all, will be examined in depth. The reason for their importance, their method of calculation, the standards we should expect from them and, finally, their interrelationships will be explored.
