<P><A id=iddle1352 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1448 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1487 class=indexterm></A>By &#8216;financial strength&#8217; we mean a company&#8217;s ability to withstand operating setbacks. In the previous chapter we looked at the short-term position. The long-term situation is even more important. To arrive at an assessment for this we look at a company&#8217;s total borrowings, and we relate them to its trading cash flow. The first measure we use is referred to as &#8216;interest cover&#8217;.</P>

<H1 class=title><A id=ch10lev1sec1></A>Interest cover</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>This ratio is of fairly recent vintage. It is unique in that it is a measure derived solely from the profit and loss account.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Interest cover" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>The &#8216;interest&#8217; charge is divided into the &#8216;EBIT&#8217; figure to give the &#8216;cover&#8217; expressed as &#8216;so many times&#8217;.</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P>Previous ratios looked only at the amount of borrowing. This ratio measures a company&#8217;s ability to service those borrowings.</P>
<P>Three factors determine its value:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>The operating profit</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>The total amount borrowed</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>The effective rate of interest.</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>A highly profitable company can have very adequate interest cover even though the balance sheet may appear to be over-borrowed.</P>
<P>The level of interest rates in an economy will impinge significantly on this ratio, which may partly explain why low-interest economies seem to accept more highly leveraged balance sheets.</P>

<P>The term &#8216;financial leverage&#8217; is used to reflect the relationship between profit and the fixed interest charge. If financial leverage is high, that is, if interest is a high part of pre-interest profits, a small change in operating profit will be greatly magnified in its effect on return to the shareholders. A highly leveraged company does well in boom times, but quickly falls into difficulty in recession.</P></DIV>
<P>We can see in <A title="Figure&nbsp;10.1.&nbsp;Interest cover applied to data from (A) the US Consolidated Company Inc., (B) UK top companies, 2000" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch10.html#ch10fig01"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 10.1</FONT></A> that the average for the US Consolidated Company Inc. is 10.9 times.

It is the great test of the financial strength of a company. Although used universally, it unfortunately turns up under many different names and with different methods of calculation. This causes some confusion which we will try to remove in this chapter.</P>
<P>The purpose of the ratio is to measure the mix of funds in the balance sheet and to make a comparison between those funds that have been supplied by the owners (equity) and those which have been borrowed (debt). This distinction is illustrated in <A title="Figure&nbsp;10.2.&nbsp;The debt to equity ratio" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch10.html#ch10fig02"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 10.2</FONT></A>.</P>

<P>We will first consider different meanings given to the term &#8216;debt&#8217;. In <A title="Figure&nbsp;10.3.&nbsp;Different definitions of debt" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch10.html#ch10fig03"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 10.3</FONT></A> you will see the three interpretations in common use:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>long-term loans only</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>long- and short-term loans (i.e., all interest-bearing debt)</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>long-term loans plus all current liabilities (i.e., total debt)</P></LI></UL></DIV></DIV>
<P>Note that the first two definitions concentrate on formal interest-bearing debt, i.e., that sourced from banks or other financial institutions. In bank calculations, these are the definitions most commonly used. The final definition includes trade creditors plus all accruals, such as dividends, tax and other miscellaneous amounts.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/face.jpg" width=37></DIV>
<P><SPAN class=italic>The reason bank analysts use the more restricted view of debt is understandable. Their claims usually rank ahead of trade and other creditors. (Note that, at this point, we leave out the important question of creditors with statutory preference.) From the banks&#8217; point of view, the only debt that matters is that which ranks equal to or ahead of their own position.</SPAN></P>
<P>However, from the companies&#8217; viewpoint, debt due to a supplier is just as real and as important as that due to a bank. There are therefore good arguments for including all debt in the calculation of the debt to equity ratio.</P>

<P><A id=iddle1278 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1844 class=indexterm></A>As stated previously, one kind of debt is as important as another from a management point of view. For that reason, we will use the broadest definition &#8211; long-term loans plus current liabilities &#8211; for the remainder of this book. This done, we will examine the various ways in which the ratio can be calculated.</P>
<P>First we should emphasize that it matters little which method of calculation we use. Different methods simply give different numbers that mean the same thing. We can measure length in either inches or centimetres and the different numbers express the same length. So also we express the relationship between equity and debt in different ways. The true ratio is the same irrespective of how it is expressed.</P>
<P>This point is worth noting. There are a relatively small number of independent financial ratios that are absolutely fundamental; this is such a one. Sometimes it seems that there are dozens of business ratios of all kinds.</P>
<P><A title="Figure&nbsp;10.4.&nbsp;Different methods of expressing the debt into equity ratio" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch10.html#ch10fig04"><FONT color=#0066cc>Figure 10.4</FONT></A>. shows three methods for expressing the &#8216;debt to equity&#8217; ratio:</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Debt/equity &#8211; methods of calculation" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/tickmark.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Method 1 &#8211; debt over equity</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P>This is the classic approach and it is used widely, i.e. all formal interest bearing debt is expressed as a ratio to equity. When a debt to equity value is quoted for a company, then, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be assumed that this method has been adopted.</P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Method 2 &#8211; equity over total funds</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P>An approach that is not so common. The answer is almost the reciprocal of the third method shown below and one which is more often encountered.</P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>Method 3 &#8211; total debt over total funds</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P>This approach is favored by the author, i.e. all debt in the balance sheet, whether interest bearing or not, is expressed as a percentage of total funds. It gives an instant picture of the funding side of the total balance sheet. The numbers are easily extracted from the most complex set of accounts.</P>

<P>The greater the debt, the greater the risk. All debt in the balance sheet gives third parties legal claims on the company. These claims are for interest payments at regular intervals, plus repayment of the principal by the agreed time. The principal is repaid either by periodic instalments or a single lump sum at the end of the loan period.</P>
<P>Therefore when a company raises debt, it takes on a commitment to substantial fixed cash out-flows for some time into the future. The company does not have a guaranteed cash in-flow over the same period. Indeed the in-flow may be most uncertain. A fixed cash out-flow combined with an uncertain cash in-flow gives rise to financial risk. It follows that the greater the loan, the greater is the risk.</P>
<P>Why, then, do companies take on debt and incur this extra risk? The answer lies in the relative costs. Debt costs less than equity funds. By adding debt to its balance sheet, a company can generally improve its profitability, add to its share price, increase the wealth of its shareholders and develop greater potential for growth.</P>

<P>Debt increases both profit and risk. It is the job of management to maintain a proper balance between the two.</P></DIV>
<P>Where should the line be drawn? The increased return to the equity shareholder that results from debt leverage can rarely be forsaken altogether even though some companies do just that. Most companies must take a view on the degree of uncertainty of future cash receipts and arrange their level of debt in line with this uncertainty.</P>
<P>We find that companies in business sectors with very predictable income streams, e.g. property leasing, incur high levels of debt. Companies in highly volatile sectors, e.g. mine exploration, fund mainly from equity.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>We find geographical as well as sectoral differences in companies&#8217; approach to debt (see <A title="Figure&nbsp;10.5.&nbsp;Analysis of debt/total assets ratio by country and by sector" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch10.html#ch10fig05"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 10.5</FONT></A>). In the US as well as in the UK the approach is more conservative than we find in the EU. In the former locations it is unusual for debt/total assets to exceed 60 percent. In the latter we often encounter ratios of 70 percent and over.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;10.6.&nbsp;Effects of different levels of leverage</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>In section B,</STRONG></SPAN> just one level of leverage is analyzed to show you how the figures work. Option 1 in the first row illustrates a situation with $100,000 equity and no debt. Accordingly there is no interest charge. The total profit of $15,000 is applied to the shareholders&#8217; investment of $100,000. The ROE is 15 percent.</P>
<P>In the second row, the funding mix has changed to $80,000 equity and $20,000 debt. The interest charge at 10 percent is $2,000. This is deducted from the profit of $15,000 to leave $13,000 for the shareholders. Because the equity investment is now $80,000 the ROE is 16.25 percent ($13,000/$80,000 &#215; 100).</P>
<P>As a result of introducing 20 percent debt into the company, the ROE has increased from 15 percent to 16.25 percent. This is financial leverage in action.</P>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>In section C,</STRONG></SPAN> the leverage has been extended in steps all the way up to 90 percent. With each additional slice of debt, the ROE increases until it reaches 60 percent at the 90 percent level of debt. Extraordinarily high levels of return can thus be achieved from very highly leveraged companies. The price that is paid for these high returns is the additional exposure to risk.</P></DIV>

<P><A id=iddle1267 class=indexterm></A>The debt/equity or leverage decision is one of great importance to management. There is a risk return trade-off. The impulse to achieve high returns for the shareholders must be restrained by the company&#8217;s risk profile. Even a very well managed company can suffer an unexpected deterioration in its financial position either from a default on the part of a major debtor or a general worsening of business conditions. Such a deterioration can be very difficult to recover from. It is prudent to keep some liquidity in reserve to guard against such an eventuality.

<P><A id=iddle1138 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1142 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1649 class=indexterm></A>The cash flow statement completes a company&#8217;s set of published accounts. Its purpose is to track the flow of funds through the company. It identifies where cash has gone to and where it has come from and it is a very powerful tool for explaining movements in the various liquidity ratios.</P></DIV>
<P>There are those who would contend that the cash flow statement is more reliable and less subject to manipulation than the profit and loss account.</P>
<P>Many operating cash movements do not appear in the profit and loss account. One reason is that the profit and loss account uses the accruals concept to adjust a company&#8217;s cash flows to bring them into line with revenue earned and costs incurred for a specific period. While it is most important that true revenue and costs are identified, these adjustments sometimes hide important aspects of a company&#8217;s affairs.</P>
<P>The cash flow statement has in the past been presented in many formats, but it has now been standardized into the layout shown (in slightly simplified form) in <A title="Figure&nbsp;11.6.&nbsp;Main headings of a corporate cash flow report" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch11.html#ch11fig06"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 11.6</FONT></A>.</P>

<P>The rules relating to cash flow are very simple. Every time a company writes a cheque, a cash out-flow occurs. When a cheque is received, there is a cash in-flow. This is the only rule, and its very simplicity means that it is difficult to find mechanisms to hide unpleasant truths about a company&#8217;s affairs.</P></DIV>
<P>However, despite its clarity, it cannot, as is occasionally suggested, replace the profit and loss account. The latter correctly distinguishes between cash paid for electricity consumed last month and cash paid for a building that will be occupied by the company for the next 20 years.</P>
<P>This chapter looks at the logic of the cash flow statement and how it can be of use to management.</P></DIV>

It has been laid out in vertical columns to facilitate comparison between the two years. The assets are in the upper section of the statement and the liabilities in the lower. To the right of the balance sheet, two extra columns have been added &#8211; respectively &#8216;Source&#8217; and &#8216;Use&#8217;.</P>

<P>The logic of the first entry is fairly obvious. The fixed assets have increased from $22,500 to $32,500. The company has had to write a cheque for $10,000. (For the purposes of this exercise we ignore revaluation and depreciation.)</P>
<P>The second entry is less obvious. The amount shown under &#8216;Tax&#8217; has increased from $2,500 to $3,000. How can an increase in tax be a source of funds? The answer is that the tax amount of $3,000 shown as a liability in the closing balance sheet is unpaid. The company now has the use of $500 more government money than it had one year ago, so for the present it is a source of funds. This liability will have to be paid off in due course. It will then disappear from the balance sheet and be picked up as a use of funds.</P>

<P>It can be difficult at first to distinguish sources from uses and to put items into the wrong columns. Fortunately there is a rule that makes the classification very simple:</P>

<P>Therefore to complete the statement one simply needs to identify a change in any balance sheet value and answer the the following questions:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>&#8216;Is the item an asset or liability?&#8217;</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>&#8216;Has its value increased or decreased?&#8217;</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P class=continued>then the item automatically slots into its correct column.</P>
<P>The exercise illustrates a technique for translating all balance sheet changes into corresponding movements of funds. The reader will appreciate that this method does not in fact identify all cash payments and all cash receipts. What it does is track net movements in assets and liabilities that will impinge on a company&#8217;s cash position. The method demonstrated is called the &#8216;indirect method&#8217;.<A id=ch11fn01 class=footnote href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch11.html#ftn.ch11fn01"><SUP class=footnote><FONT color=#0066cc>[*]</FONT></SUP></A></P></DIV>

<P><SPAN class=italic>A word of caution is needed here. The indirect method picks up only the net movements in balance sheet values. Of course a net change can be the result of two opposing movements that partly cancel out. A full cash flow statement should pick such items. Even more importantly some movements in balance sheet values do not give rise to cash flow &#8211; revaluation of fixed assets is an example (see <A title="Appendix&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Special items" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/apa.html"><FONT color=#0066cc>appendix 1</FONT></A>). It may be necessary to get behind some of the numbers to find out if there are any hidden or non-cash movements. Notwithstanding these qualifications, the method illustrated here is a powerful tool of analysis.</SPAN><A id=iddle1396 class=indexterm></A></P></DIV></DIV>

<P>For instance, the company&#8217;s cash position could deteriorate even though high profits have been achieved. To explain why, we could use a layout that would reconcile opening and closing cash with the net cash flow for the period. It would show:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>the opening cash balance,</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>the itemized cash out-flows,</P>

<P>the itemized cash in-flows,</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>the closing cash balance.</P></LI></UL></DIV>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;11.3.&nbsp;Opening and closing cash reconciliation</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>

<P>The various entries are taken straight from the &#8216;sources/uses&#8217; statement (see <A title="Figure&nbsp;11.2.&nbsp;Completed allocation of sources and uses of funds" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch11.html#ch11fig02"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 11.2</FONT></A>). &#8216;Cash-out&#8217; items are taken from the &#8216;use&#8217; column and &#8216;cash-in&#8217; from the &#8216;source&#8217; column. There is one exception to this rule: movements in &#8216;cash&#8217; and &#8216;short loan&#8217; are not listed because they are absorbed in the &#8216;opening/closing&#8217; cash positions.</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>The total for cash-out comes to: $12,850 (negative)</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>The total for cash-in comes to: $ 6,000 (positive)</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>The net cash flow is the difference: $ 6,850 (negative)</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>This net cash flow, added to the opening cash figure of $1,750 (positive) gives the closing cash position of $5,100 (negative).</P>
<P>The statement clearly identifies major movements in the cash position. Even a cursory examination of the figures shows the reason for the negative cash flow. The company has expended $10,000 on fixed assets. This relatively large sum has not been matched by any corresponding large cash in-flows. The assets have been purchased from day-to-day operating cash.</P>
<P>The heavily negative net cash flow also explains why the &#8216;current ratio&#8217; has dropped from 1.8 to 1.2 times, and the &#8216;debt to total assets&#8217; ratio of the company has increased from 47 percent to 54 percent.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;11.4.&nbsp;Long and short analysis of sources and uses of funds</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>Each item in the &#8216;Source&#8217; column has been slotted into its appropriate &#8216;long&#8217; or &#8216;short&#8217; box. Ditto for all items in the &#8216;Use&#8217; column. The boxes are totaled to give four major values for comparison.</P>
<P>The main expenditure has taken place in the &#8216;Long-Use&#8217; box. We identify here the large fixed asset purchase of $10,000.</P>
<P>The corresponding &#8216;Long-Source&#8217; box shows $2,250. The total amount of long-term cash received into the business by way of &#8216;Reserves&#8217; and the &#8216;Long-term loans&#8217; falls considerably short of the fixed asset expenditure.</P>
<P>Because &#8216;sources&#8217; and &#8216;uses&#8217; must balance, the above deficit must be made good from the &#8216;Short-Source&#8217; box. We see that this is indeed the case. The bulk of the cash in-flow falls into the short-term box.</P>
<P>Most of the money that has come into the business has come from &#8216;accounts payable&#8217; and &#8216;bank loan&#8217;. These are due to be repaid within 12 months. The company has used short-term sources to fund long-term assets.</P>
<P>This layout of the cash flow highlights the fact that &#8216;current liabilities&#8217; have increased by much more than &#8216;current assets&#8217; and has brought about the deterioration we have already seen in the &#8216;current ratio&#8217;.</P>
<P>The &#8216;debt to total assets ratio&#8217; has also deteriorated over the 2000&#8211;01 period. This is analyzed in further detail in the next section.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;11.5.&nbsp;Strategy for long and short movements of funds</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>The problem with this strategy is that short-term funds have to be repaid quickly, but they cannot be withdrawn from the investment to meet this repayment. Therefore a new source of funds must be found to meet the repayments. Conditions could deteriorate to the extent that the company would be unable to raise new money and it would then be in a financial crisis. The grid has identified a movement of funds that is loaded with risk.</P>

<P>A well-known principle of finance is that funds for long-term uses should come from long-term sources &#8211; the matching principle. Short-term uses can be largely funded from short-term sources, but not entirely as we shall see.</P>
<P>A second principle of finance is that the new funds into the company should be sourced in the proportions of a good &#8216;debt to equity ratio&#8217;.</P></DIV>
<P>For example, if the company had an existing ratio of 60 percent debt to 40 percent equity, then we would expect the new funds to reflect this mix approximately. In the example used, however, the funds have been raised as approximately 90 percent debt ($11,600 including LTL) and 10 percent equity ($1,250). It is this high level of debt in the new funds that has damaged the &#8216;debt to equity ratio&#8217; of the company by moving it from 47 percent to 54 percent.</P>

<P>A third principle it is advisable to follow is that the totals in the two short-term boxes should show the same relationship as &#8216;current assets&#8217; to &#8216;current liabilities&#8217; in the opening balance sheet.</P></DIV>
<P>This must be so if we wish to maintain the existing &#8216;current ratio&#8217;. In the example used the short-source box should have a total that is just little in excess of 50 percent of the short-use box. In fact the figure that emerges is almost 400 percent.</P>
<P>The analysis has shown that the company has breached all three principles of cash flow management.</P></DIV></DIV>

Criticism has been voiced of existing standards of reporting.</P>
<P>As a result the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) of the various developed countries have stepped up their efforts to impose more rigorous reporting standards. The cash flow statement has been one to receive particular attention.</P>
<P>Phrases such as: &#8216;to give users information on the liquidity, viability and financial adaptability of the entity concerned,&#8217;; &#8216;improved understanding of a reporting entity&#8217;s cash generating or cash absorption mechanisms,&#8217;; &#8216;basis for the assessment of future cash flow,&#8217; give a flavor of the desired objectives.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Financial reporting standards" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/tickmark.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>The standards arrived at lay great stress on identifying the following separate components of the flow of cash and its equivalents:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>operating activities</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>servicing of finance and taxation</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>investing activities</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>financing activities.</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>They further require a reconciliation of the figure shown for operating profit and operating cash flow, as well as a total showing the net cash in-flow or out-flow before financing.</P>

<P>The terminology in the Reporting Standards will be widely used in board-rooms and management meetings over the coming years. It is important that managers be familiar with this terminology and appreciate the significance of the various components of cash flow. The sources and uses statement has been dropped as a reporting requirement, but it still remains a powerful tool of analysis for managers to use for their own benefit.</P></DIV>
