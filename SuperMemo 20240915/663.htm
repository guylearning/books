<td bordercolor="#0066FF">
<STRONG>Make most Anki questions and answers as atomic as possible:</STRONG> That is, both the question and answer express just one idea. As an example, when I was learning the Unix command line, I entered the question: &#8220;How to create a soft link from <CODE>linkname</CODE> to <CODE>filename</CODE>?&#8221; The answer was: &#8220;<CODE>ln -s filename linkname</CODE>&#8221;. Unfortunately, I routinely got this question wrong. </P>
<P>The solution was to refactor the question by breaking it into two pieces. One piece was: &#8220;What's the basic command and option to create a Unix soft link?&#8221; Answer: &#8220;<CODE>ln -s &#8230;</CODE>&#8221;. And the second piece was: &#8220;When creating a Unix soft link, in what order do <CODE>linkname</CODE> and <CODE>filename</CODE> go?&#8221; Answer: &#8220;<CODE>filename linkname</CODE>&#8221;. </P>
<P>Breaking this question into more atomic pieces turned a question I routinely got wrong into two questions I routinely got right*<SPAN class=marginnote 72%? LEFT: 148px; WIDTH:>* An even more atomic version would be to break the first question into &#8220;What's the Unix command to create a link?&#8221; and &#8220;What's the option to the <CODE>ln</CODE> command to create a soft link?&#8221; In practice, I've known for years that <CODE>ln</CODE> is the command to create a link, and so this wasn't necessary.</SPAN>. Most of all: when I wanted to create a Unix soft link in practice, I knew how to do it. </P>
<P>I'm not sure what's responsible for this effect. I suspect it's partly about focus. When I made mistakes with the combined question, I was often a little fuzzy about where exactly my mistake was. That meant I didn't focus sharply enough on the mistake, and so didn't learn as much from my failure. When I fail with the atomic questions my mind knows exactly where to focus. </P>
<P>In general, I find that you often get substantial benefit from breaking Anki questions down to be more atomic. It's a powerful pattern for question refactoring. </P>
<P>Note that this doesn't mean you shouldn't also retain some version of the original question. I still want to know how to create a soft link in Unix, and so it's worth keeping the original question in Anki. But it becomes an integrative question, part of a hierarchy of questions building up from simple atomic facts to more complex ideas. </P>
<P>Incidentally, just because a question is atomic doesn't mean it can't involve quite complex, high-level concepts. Consider the following question, from the field of general relativity: &#8220;What is the <EM>dr<SUP>2</SUP></EM> term in the Robertson-Walker metric?&#8221; Answer: <EM>dr<SUP>2</SUP>/(1-kr^2)</EM>. Now, unless you've studied general relativity that question probably seems quite opaque. It's a sophisticated, integrative question, assuming you know what the Robertson-Walker metric is, what <EM>dr<SUP>2</SUP></EM> means, what <EM>k</EM> means, and so on. But conditional on that background knowledge, it's quite an atomic question and answer. </P>
<P>One benefit of using Anki in this way is that you begin to habitually break things down into atomic questions. This sharply crystallizes the distinct things you've learned. Personally, I find that crystallization satisfying, for reasons I (ironically) find difficult to articulate. But one real benefit is that later I often find those atomic ideas can be put together in ways I didn't initially anticipate. And that's well worth the trouble.

<STRONG>Anki isn't just a tool for memorizing simple facts. It's a tool for understanding almost anything.</STRONG> It's a common misconception that Anki is just for memorizing simple raw facts, things like vocabulary items and basic definitions. But as we've seen, it's possible to use Anki for much more advanced types of understanding. My questions about AlphaGo began with simple questions such as &#8220;How large is a Go board?&#8221;, and ended with high-level conceptual questions about the design of the AlphaGo systems &#8211; on subjects such as how AlphaGo avoided over-generalizing from training data, the limitations of convolutional neural networks, and so on. </P>
<P>Part of developing Anki as a virtuoso skill is cultivating the ability to use it for types of understanding beyond basic facts. Indeed, many of the observations I've made (and will make, below) about how to use Anki are really about what it means to understand something. Break things up into atomic facts. Build rich hierarchies of interconnections and integrative questions. Don't put in orphan questions. Patterns for how to engage with reading material. Patterns (and anti-patterns) for question types. Patterns for the kinds of things you'd like to memorize. Anki skills concretely instantiate your theory of how you understand; developing those skills will help you understand better. It's too strong to say that to be a virtuoso Anki user is to be a virtuoso in understanding. But there's some truth to it.

I used to do this, but I've gradually*<SPAN class=marginnote 72%? LEFT: 148px; WIDTH:>* It's gradual because questions sometimes need to be rewritten due to the changed context. For instance, both my Emacs and Unix command line decks had very similar questions, along the lines of: &#8220;How to delete a word?&#8221; Those questions need to be rewritten, e.g. as: &#8220;In Emacs, how to delete a word?&#8221; (This, by the way, may seem a strange question for a long-time Emacs user such as myself. In fact, I've used Anki to help me change the way I delete words in Emacs, which is why I have an Anki question on the subject. I have made many improvements to my Emacs workflow this way.)</SPAN> merged my decks and subdecks into one big deck. The world isn't divided up into neatly separated components, and I believe it's good to collide very different types of questions. One moment Anki is asking me a question about the temperature chicken should be cooked to. The next: a question about the JavaScript API. Is this mixing doing me any real good? I'm not sure. I have not, as yet, found any reason to use JavaScript to control the cooking of a chicken. But I don't think this mixing does any harm, and hope it is creatively stimulating, and helps me apply my knowledge in unusual contexts.

<STRONG><SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> Avoid orphan questions</SPAN></FONT>:</STRONG> Suppose I'm reading online and stumble across a great article about the grooming habits of the Albanian giant mongoose, a subject I never previously knew I was interested in, but which turns out to be fascinating. Pretty soon I've Ankified 5 to 10 questions. That's great, but my experience suggests that in a few months I'll likely find those questions rather stale, and frequently get them wrong. I believe the reason is that those questions are too disconnected from my other interests, and I will have lost the context that made me interested. 
<P></P>
<P>I call these <EM>orphan questions</EM>, because they're not closely related to anything else in my memory. It's not bad to have a few orphan questions in Anki &#8211; it can be difficult to know what will turn out to be of only passing interest, and what will grow into a substantial interest, connected to my other interests. But if a substantial minority of your questions are orphans, that's a sign you should concentrate more on Ankifying questions related to your main creative projects, and cut down on Ankifying tangential material. </P>
<P>It's particularly worth avoiding lonely orphans: single questions that are largely disconnected from everything else. Suppose, for instance, I'm reading an article on a new subject, and I learn an idea that seems particularly useful. I make it a rule to never put in one question. Rather, I try to put at least two questions in, preferably three or more. That's usually enough that it's at least the nucleus of a bit of useful knowledge. If it's a lonely orphan, inevitably I get the question wrong all the time, and it's a waste to have entered it at all.

<STRONG><SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> Construct your own decks</SPAN></FONT>:</STRONG> The Anki site has <A href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">many shared decks</A>, but I've found only a little use for them. The most important reason is that making Anki cards is an act of understanding in itself. That is, figuring out good questions to ask, and good answers, is part of what it means to understand a new subject well. To use someone else's cards is to forgo much of that understanding. 
<P></P>
<P>Indeed, I believe the act of constructing the cards actually helps with memory. Memory researchers have repeatedly found that the more elaborately you encode a memory, the stronger the memory will be. By elaborative encoding, they mean essentially the richness of the associations you form. </P>
<P>For instance, it's possible to try to remember as an isolated fact that 1962 was the year the first telecommunications satellite, Telstar, was put into orbit. But a better way of remembering it is to relate that fact to others. Relatively prosaically, you might observe that Telstar was launched just 5 years after the first Soviet satellite, Sputnik. It didn't take long to put space to use for telecommunications. Less prosaically &#8211; a richer elaboration &#8211; I personally find it fascinating that Telstar was put into orbit the year <EM>before</EM> the introduction of ASCII, arguably the first modern digital standard for communicating text. Humanity had a telecommunications satellite before we had a digital standard for communicating text! Finding that kind of connection is an example of an elaborative encoding. </P>
<P>The act of constructing an Anki card is itself nearly always a form of elaborative encoding. It forces you to think through alternate forms of the question, to consider the best possible answers, and so on. I believe this is true for even the most elementary cards. And it certainly becomes true if you construct more complex cards, cards relating the basic fact to be remembered to other ideas (like the Telstar-ASCII link), gradually building up a web of richly interrelated ideas. </P>
<P>With that said, there are some valuable deck-sharing practices. For instance, there are communities of medical students who find value in sharing and sometimes collaboratively constructing decks*<SPAN class=marginnote WIDTH: 148px; LEFT: 72%?>* See the <A href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/">MedicalSchoolAnki subreddit</A>, which contains frequent discussion of the best decks, how to use them, as well as an ever-changing canon of best decks to use for different purposes. See also the paper: Michael Hart-Matyas <EM>et al</EM>, <A href="https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Hart-Matyas2018.pdf">Twelve tips for medical students to establish a collaborative flashcard project</A>, Medical Teacher (2018).</SPAN>. I've also found value in shared decks containing very elementary questions, such as <A href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/685421036">art decks</A> which ask questions such as who painted a particular painting. But for deeper kinds of understanding, I've not yet found good ways of using shared decks.

LEFT: 148px; WIDTH:>* An entertaining and informative overview is: Joshua Foer, &#8220;Moonwalking with Einstein&#8221; (2011).</SPAN>. This is an extreme form of elaborative encoding, making rich visual and spatial associations to the material you want to remember. Here's Joshua Foer recounting a conversation where mnemonist Ed Cooke describes one basic technique: 
<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ed then explained to me his procedure for making a name memorable, which he had used in the competition to memorize the first and last names associated with ninety-nine different photographic head shots in the names-and-faces event. It was a technique he promised I could use to remember people's names at parties and meetings. &#8220;The trick is actually deceptively simple,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is always to associate the sound of a person's name with something you can clearly imagine. It's all about creating a vivid image in your mind that anchors your visual memory of the person's face to a visual memory connected to the person's name. When you need to reach back and remember the person's name at some later date, the image you created will simply pop back into your mind&#8230; So, hmm, you said your name was Josh Foer, eh?&#8221; He raised an eyebrow and gave his chin a melodramatic stroke. &#8220;Well, I'd imagine you joshing me where we first met, outside the competition hall, and I'd imagine myself breaking into four pieces in response. Four/Foer, get it? That little image is more entertaining&#8212;to me, at least&#8212;than your mere name, and should stick nicely in the mind.&#8221; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I've experimented with these techniques, and while they're fun, they seem most useful for memorizing trivia &#8211; sequences of playing cards, strings of digits, and so on. They seem less well developed for more abstract concepts, and such abstractions are often where the deepest understanding lies. In that sense, they may even distract from understanding. That said, it's possible I simply need to figure out better ways of using these ideas, much as I needed to figure out Anki. In particular, it may be worth further investigating some of the techniques used by practitioners to form rich associations. As Foer says, quoting a memory expert, there is great value in learning to &#8220;think in more memorable ways&#8221;.

<STRONG><SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> 95% of Anki's value comes from 5% of the features</SPAN></FONT>:</STRONG> Anki has ways of auto-generating cards, of tagging cards, a plugin ecosystem, and much else. In practice, I rarely use any of these features. My cards are always one of two types: the majority are simple question and answer; a substantial minority are what's called a <EM>cloze</EM>: a kind of fill-in-the-blanks test. For instance, I'll use clozes to test myself on favorite quotes: 
<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&#8220;if the personal computer is truly a __ then the use of it would actually change the __ of an __", __, __&#8221; (Answer: new medium, thought patterns, entire civilization, Alan Kay, 1989). </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Clozes can also be used to pose questions not involving quotes: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Adelson illusion is also known as the ___ illusion. (Answer: checker-shadow) </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Why not use more of Anki's features? Part of the reason is that I get an enormous benefit from just the core features. Furthermore, learning to use this tiny set of features well has required a lot of work. A basketball and hoop are simple pieces of equipment, but you can spend a lifetime learning to use them well. Similarly, basic Anki practice can be developed enormously. And so I've concentrated on learning to use those basic features well. </P>
<P>I know many people who try Anki out, and then go down a rabbit hole learning as many features as possible so they can use it &#8220;efficiently&#8221;. Usually, they're chasing 1% improvements. Often, those people ultimately give up Anki as &#8220;too difficult&#8221;, which is often a synonym for &#8220;I got nervous I wasn't using it perfectly&#8221;. This is a pity. As discussed earlier, Anki offers something like a 20-fold improvement over (say) ordinary flashcards. And so they're giving up a 2,000% improvement because they were worried they were missing a few final 5%, 1% and (in many cases) 0.1% improvements. This kind of rabbit hole seems to be especially attractive to programmers. </P>
<P>For this reason, when someone is getting started I advise not using any advanced features, and not installing any plugins. Don't, in short, come down with a bad case of programmer's efficiency disease. Learn how to use Anki for basic question and answer, and concentrate on exploring new patterns within that paradigm. That'll serve you far better than any number of hours spent fiddling around with the features. Then, if you build a regular habit of high-quality Anki use, you can experiment with more advanced features.

It works well for things like &#8220;Is [my friend] a vegan?&#8221; But my use has run somewhat aground on thornier questions. For instance, suppose I talk with a new friend about their kids, but have never met those kids. I could put in questions like &#8220;What is the name of [my friend's] eldest child?&#8221; Or, if we'd chatted about music, I might put in: &#8220;What is a musician [my friend] likes?&#8221; </P>
<P>This kind of experiment is well intentioned. But posing such questions often leaves me feeling uncomfortable. It seems too much like faking interest in my friends. There's a pretty strong social norm that if you remember your friends' taste in music or their kids' names, it's because you're interested in that friend. Using a memory aid feels somehow ungenuine, at least to me. </P>
<P>I've talked with several friends about this. Most have told me the same thing: they appreciate me going to so much trouble in the first place, and find it charming that I'd worry so much about whether it was ungenuine. So perhaps it's a mistake to worry. Nonetheless, I still have trouble with it. I have adopted Anki for less personal stuff &#8211; things like people's food preferences. And maybe over time I'll use it for storing more personal facts. But for now I'm taking it slow.

<STRONG><SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> Procedural versus declarative memory</SPAN></FONT>:</STRONG> There's a big difference between remembering a fact and mastering a process. For instance, while you might remember a Unix command when cued by an Anki question, that doesn't mean you'll recognize an opportunity to use the command in the context of the command line, and be comfortable typing it out. And it's still another thing to find novel, creative ways of combining the commands you know, in order to solve challenging problems. 
<P></P>
<P>Put another way: to really internalize a process, it's not enough just to review Anki cards. You need to carry out the process, in context. And you need to solve real problems with it. </P>
<P>With that said, I've found the transfer process relatively easy. In the case of the command line, I use it often enough that I have plenty of opportunities to make real use of my Ankified knowledge of the command line. Over time, that declarative knowledge is becoming procedural knowledge I routinely use in context. That said, it'd be good to better understand when the transfer works and when it doesn't. Even better would be a memory system that integrates into my actual working environment. For instance, it could query me on Unix commands, while placing me at an actual command line. Or perhaps it would ask me to solve higher-level problems, while at the command line. </P>
<P>I've tried one experiment in this vein: miming the action of typing commands while I review my Anki cards. But my subjective impression was that it doesn't work so well, and it was also quite annoying to do. So I stopped.

<STRONG><SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> Getting past &#8220;names don't matter&#8221;</SPAN></FONT>:</STRONG> I'm a theoretical physicist by training. There is a famous story in physics, told by Richard Feynman, dismissing the value of knowing the names of things. As a child, Feynman was out playing in a field with a know-it-all kid. Here's what happened, in Feynman's telling*<SPAN class=marginnote 72%? LEFT: 148px; WIDTH:>* Richard P. Feynman, &#8220;What Do You Care What Other People Think? Further Adventures of a Curious Character&#8221; (1989).</SPAN>: 
<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One kid says to me, &#8220;See that bird? What kind of bird is that?&#8221; <BR><BR>I said, &#8220;I haven't the slightest idea what kind of a bird it is.&#8221; <BR><BR>He says, &#8220;It'a brown-throated thrush. Your father doesn't teach you anything!&#8221; <BR><BR>But it was the opposite. He [Feynman's father] had already taught me: &#8220;See that bird?&#8221; he says. &#8220;It's a Spencer's warbler.&#8221; (I knew he didn't know the real name.) &#8220;Well, in Italian, it's a <EM>Chutto Lapittida</EM>. In Portuguese, it's a <EM>Bom da Peida</EM>&#8230; You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird! You'll only know about humans in different places, and what they call the bird. So let's look at the bird and see what it's <EM>doing</EM> &#8212; that's what counts.&#8221; (I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.) </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Feynman (or his father) goes on to a thoughtful discussion of real knowledge: observing behavior, understanding the reasons for it, and so on. </P>
<P>It's a good story. But it goes too far: names do matter. Maybe not as much as the know-it-all kid thought, and they're not usually a deep kind of knowledge. But they're the foundation that allows you to build up a network of knowledge. </P>
<P>This trope that names don't matter was repeatedly drilled into me during my scientific training. When I began using Anki, at first I felt somewhat silly putting questions about names for things into the system. But now I do it enthusiastically, knowing that it's an early step along the way to understanding. </P>
<P>Anki is useful for names of all kinds of things, but I find it particularly helpful for non-verbal things. For instance, I put in questions about artworks, like: &#8220;What does the artist <A href="https://www.emilyhare.co.uk/">Emily Hare's</A> painting <EM>Howl</EM> look like?&#8221; Answer: </P>
<CENTER><img src="https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/EmilyHareHowl.png"> </CENTER>
<P>I put that question in for two reasons. The main reason is that I like to remember the experience of the painting from time to time. And the other is to put a name to the painting*<SPAN class=marginnote 72%? LEFT: 148px; WIDTH:>* Actually, a better question for that is to be shown the painting and asked what its name is.</SPAN>. If I wanted to think more analytically about the painting &#8211; say, about the clever use of color gradients &#8211; I could add more detailed questions. But I'm pretty happy just committing the experience of the image to memory.

<STRONG>What do you do when you get behind?</STRONG> Anki becomes challenging when you get behind with cards. If you skip a day or two &#8211; or fifty &#8211; the cards begin to back up. It's intimidating to come back to find you have 500 cards to review in a day. Even worse, if you fall out of the Anki habit, you can get a very long way behind. I largely stopped using Anki for a 7-month period, and came back to thousands of backlogged cards. </P>
<P>Fortunately, it wasn't that hard to catch up. I set myself gradually increasing quotas (100, 150, 200, 250, and eventually 300) of cards per day, and worked through those quotas each day for several weeks until I'd caught up. </P>
<P>While this wasn't too difficult, it was somewhat demoralizing and discouraging. It'd be better if Anki had a &#8220;catch up&#8221; feature that would spread the excess cards over the next few weeks in your schedule. But it doesn't. In any case, this is a gotcha, but it's not too difficult to address.

<STRONG><SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> Using Anki for APIs, books, videos, seminars, conversations, the web, events, and places</SPAN></FONT>:</STRONG> Nearly everything I said earlier about Ankifying papers applies also to other resources. Here's a few tips. I've separated out the discussion for APIs into an appendix, which you can <A href="https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html#Anki_APIs">read below</A>, if interested. 
<P></P>
<P>For seminars and conversations with colleagues I find it surprisingly helpful to set Anki quotas. For instance, for seminars I try to find at least three high-quality questions to Ankify. For extended conversations, at least one high-quality question to Ankify. I've found that setting quotas helps me pay more attention, especially during seminars. (I find it much easier <EM>a priori</EM> to pay attention in one-on-one conversation.) </P>
<P>I'm more haphazard about videos, events, and places. It'd be good to, say, systematically Ankify 3-5 questions after going on an outing or to a new restaurant, to help me remember the experience. I do this sometimes. But I haven't been that systematic. </P>
<P>I tend to Ankify in real time as I read papers and books. For seminars, conversations, and so on I prefer to immerse myself in the experience. Instead of getting out Anki, I will quickly make a mental (or paper) note of what I want to Ankify. I then enter it into Anki later. This requires some discipline; it's one reason I prefer to set a small quota, so that I merely have to enter a few questions later, rather than dozens. </P>
<P>One caution is with books: reading an entire book is a big commitment, and adding Anki questions regularly can slow you down a lot. It's worth keeping this in mind when deciding how much to Ankify. Sometimes a book is so dense with great material that it's worth taking the time to add lots of questions. But unmindfully Ankifying everything in sight is a bad habit, one I've occasionally fallen into. </P>
<P>What you Ankify is not a trivial choice: Ankify things that serve your long-term goals. In some measure we become what we remember, so we must be careful what we remember*<SPAN class=marginnote 72%? LEFT: 148px; WIDTH:>* With apologies to Kurt Vonnegut, who wrote: &#8220;We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.&#8221;.</SPAN>. This is always true, but Anki makes it especially true. </P>
<P>With all that said, one fun pattern is to go back to my old, pre-Anki notes on books, and to Ankify them. This can often be done quickly, and gives me a greater return on the time I've invested in now mostly-forgotten books*<SPAN class=marginnote LEFT: 148px; WIDTH: -20px? TOP: 72%;>* Friends sometimes complain that many books are over-padded essays. Perhaps a benefit of such padding is that it enforces an Anki-like spaced repetition, since readers take weeks to read the book. This may be an inefficient way to memorize the main points, but is better than having no memory of the book at all.</SPAN>. </P>
<P>Something I haven't yet figured out is how to integrate Anki with note taking for my creative projects. I can't replace note taking with Anki &#8211; it's too slow, and for many things a poor use of my long-term memory. On the other hand, there are many benefits to using Anki for important items &#8211; fluid access to memory is at the foundation of so much creative thought.<SPAN class=quote_right>Speed of associative thought is, I believe, important in creative work. &#8211; John Littlewood</SPAN> In practice, I find myself instinctively and unsystematically doing some things as notes, others as Anki questions, and still other things as both. Overall, it works okay, but my sense is that it could be a lot better if I applied more systematic thought and experimentation. Part of the problem is that I don't have a very good system for note taking, period! If I worked more on that, I suspect the whole thing would get a lot better. Still, it works okay.

<P>The answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;. That's fine, as far as it goes. But it'd help my understanding to elaborate the ideas in the question. Can I add a question about for which graphical models the partition function is tractable? Can I give an example of a graphical model for which the partition function is intractable?

<STRONG>Aren't external memory aids enough?</STRONG> One common criticism of systems such as Anki is that external memory devices &#8211; systems such as Google, wikis, and notebooks &#8211; really ought to be enough. Used well, such systems are, of course, extremely useful as a complement to Anki. But for creative work and for problem-solving there is something special about having an internalized understanding. It enables speed in associative thought, an ability to rapidly try out many combinations of ideas, and to intuit patterns, in ways not possible if you need to keep laboriously looking up information. </P>
<P>Fluency matters in thinking.

<P></P>
<P>The analogy is only partial. In fact, Anki seems like a continual supply of $20 bills lying on the ground. And it's reasonable to ask why it's not more widely used. One of the most cited papers in the relevant research literature*<SPAN class=marginnote WIDTH: 148px; LEFT: 72%?>* Frank N. Dempster, <A href="https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Dempster1988.pdf">The Spacing Effect: A Case Study in the Failure to Apply the Results of Psychological Research</A> (1988).</SPAN> is a discussion of why these ideas aren't more widely used in education.

<P>My own personal suspicion is that there are three main factors: </P>
<UL>
<LI>In experimental research on memory, people consistently underestimate the gains that come from distributing their study in a manner similar to Anki. Instead, they prefer last-minute cramming, and believe it produces better results, though many studies show it does not. 
<LI>The psychologist Robert Bjork has suggested*<SPAN class=marginnote WIDTH: 148px; LEFT: 72%?>*Robert A.

This suggests that an efficient memory system will intrinsically be somewhat difficult to use. Human beings have a complex relationship to difficult activities, and often dislike performing them, unless strongly motivated (in which case they may become pleasurable). 
<LI>Systems such as Anki are challenging to use well, and easy to use poorly. </LI></UL>
<P>It is interesting to consider developing systems which may overcome some or all of these issues.
