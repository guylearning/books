Depending on the type of business you are in, you might be able to outsource IT, marketing, or accounting, but there are two things that are really hard to outsource: the CEO position and the sales function. I&#8217;m not a big fan of outsourcing the CEO function because somebody has to be there every day and be the boss. It&#8217;s really hard to outsource the sales function because you&#8217;re stuck relying on an outsider for a very critical component of your business. You won&#8217;t own the contacts, and that&#8217;s a really dangerous thing. Unless you have a fear of sales, don&#8217;t outsource the sales function.
