<P><B>Myth: Natural mechanisms for selecting important memories are good enough. We do not need a crutch</B>. The evolution produced an effective forgetting mechanism that frees our memory from space-consuming and perhaps irrelevant garbage. This mechanism proved efficient enough to build the amazing human civilization. Consequently, many believe that there cannot be much room for improvement.<BR><B>Fact</B>: The forgetting mechanism was built in abstraction from our wishes and decisions. It only spares memories that are used frequently enough. Nowadays, we are smart enough to decide on our own which knowledge is vital and which is not. A single peek into a dictionary may often take more time than the lifetime time cost of refreshing the same word in SuperMemo. This is just the least spectacular example. Human history is rich in monumental errors coming from ignorance. NASA's confusion of imperial and metric units cost a lost Mars probe. Confusion of comma with a dot in Fortran, cost a Venus probe. Errors in English communication caused many aerial and maritime catastrophes. A piece of knowledge in surgeon's mind may be worth the life of his patient. Forgetting is too precarious to leave mission-critical knowledge to your brain's own devices. SuperMemo puts you in the driver's seat. You can decide what your remember and what you forget.

<P><B>Myth: We cannot improve memory by training</B>. Infinite memory is a popular optimist's myth. A pessimist's myth is that we cannot improve our memory via training. Even <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James">William James</A> in his genius book <I><A class="external text" href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/Principles/">The Principles of Psychology (1890)</A></I> wrote with certainty that memory does not change unless for the worse (e.g. as a result of aging or disease).<BR><B>Fact</B>: If considered at a very low synaptic level, memory is indeed quite resistant to improvement. Not only does it seem to change little in the course of healthy life. It is also very similar in its properties across the human population. At the very basic level, synapses of a low-IQ individual are as trainable as that of a genius. They are also not much different from those of a mollusk <I>Aplysia</I> or a fly <I>Drosophila</I>. However, there is more to memory and learning than just a single synapse. The main difference between poor students and geniuses is in their skill to represent information for learning. A genius quickly dismembers information and forms simple models that make thinking easy. Simple models of reality help understand it, process it, and remember it. What <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James">William James</A> failed to mention is that a week-long course in <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_techniques">mnemonic techniques</A> dramatically increases learning skills for many people. Their molecular or synaptic memory may not improve. What improves is their skill to handle knowledge. Consequently, they can remember more and for longer. Learning is a self-accelerating and self-amplifying process. As such it often leads to miraculous results.

No <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1738">item</A> added to SuperMemo is considered "memorized for good".

However, computer simulations as well as real-life measurements show that, with the constant daily learning time, the acquisition of new knowledge does not visibly slow down in time except for the very first couple of months. In other words, from a long-term perspective, the acquisition of new knowledge is <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/theory.htm#Figure+1">nearly linear</A>. Older <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1741">items</A> are repeated less and less frequently leaving room for new material. The exponential nature of this "fading" explains why we can continue with a heavy inflow of new material for decades.

<P><B>Myth: People differ in the speed of learning, but they all forget at the same speed</B>.<BR><B>Fact</B>: Although there are mutations that might affect the forgetting rate, at the synaptic level, the rate of forgetting is indeed basically the same (independent of how smart you are). However, the same thing that makes people learn faster, helps them forget slower. The key to learning and slow forgetting is representation (i.e. the way knowledge is formulated). If you learn with <A title=SuperMemo href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo">SuperMemo</A>, you will know that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1742">items</A> can be very difficult or very easy. The difficult ones are forgotten much faster and require shorter <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1743">intervals</A> between repetitions. The key to making <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1744">items</A> easy is to <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">formulate them well</A>. Moreover, good students will show better performance on the exactly same material. This is because the ultimate test on the formulation of knowledge is not in how it is structured in your learning material, but in the way it is stored in your mind. With massive learning effort, you will gradually improve the way you absorb and represent knowledge in your mind. The fastest student is the one who can instinctively visualize and store knowledge in his mind using imagery that provide minimum-information and maximum-connectivity.

<P><B>Myth: Hypertext can substitute for memory</B>. An amazingly large proportion of the population holds memorization in contempt. Terms "<I>rote memorization</I>", "<I>recitatory rehearsal</I>", "<I>mindless repetition</I>" are used to label any form of memorization or repetition as unintelligent. Seeing the "<I>big picture</I>", "<I>reasoning</I>" and leaving the job of remembering to external hypertext sources are supposed to be viable substitutes.<BR><B>Fact</B>: Knowledge stored in human memory is associative in nature. In other words, we are able to suddenly combine two known ideas to produce a new quality: an invention. Hypertext references are a poor substitute for associative memory. Two facts stored in human memory can instantly be put together and bring a new idea to life. The same facts stored on the Internet will remain useless until they are pieced together inside a creative mind. A mind rich in knowledge, can produce rich associations upon encountering new information. An empty mind is as useful as a toddler given the power of the Internet in search of a solution. Biological neural networks work in such a way that knowledge is retained in memory only if it is refreshed/reviewed. Learning and repetition are therefore still vital for the progress of mankind.

<P><B>Myth: We do not need SuperMemo, all we need is to build an index to knowledge sources</B>. With multiple on-line sources of knowledge, some people are tempted to believe that all we are supposed to learn is a sort of index to these external sources of knowledge.<BR><B>Fact</B>: Even "index to knowledge" is subject to forgetting and needs to be maintained via repetition or review. All creative geniuses need knowledge to form new concepts. The extent of this knowledge will vary, but the creative output does depend on the volume of knowledge, its associative nature, and its abstractness (i.e. its relevance in building models). </P>
<H4><SPAN id=Index_to_knowledge class=mw-headline>Index to knowledge</SPAN></H4>
<P>A less extreme version of "<A href="#Myth:_Memorization_is_not_needed">memorization is not needed</A>" myth, is that "we only need to remember an index to knowledge". It is true that abstract knowledge and general concepts are most useful. However, this type of knowledge is also subject to forgetting. Moreover, not all knowledge is inferential. To reason about <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</A>, we often need to know that it is cold. We might derive the temperature conclusion from the position of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</A> on the map, but we need the knowledge of the map, the knowledge of the climate, and the knowledge of the earth's position in reference to the sun. Any kid will admit that it is simpler to just remember that <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</A> is white and cold. In this case, rules are more useful, but facts are easier to remember. </P>
<P>A <I>mere mortal</I> will usually be aware that doughnuts are foods that should better be avoided by people who fear a heart disease. The fact "<I>Doughnuts ain't good for heart</I>" contributes to an average man's knowledge about health. This fact probably does not need SuperMemo. After all, most of us will refresh the knowledge about doughnuts and the heart each time we see a tasty doughnut. The <I>Doughnut Fact</I> contributes also to our <I>index to knowledge</I>. It is enough to jump to Google and type <I>+doughnut +heart</I> to make a good use of this particular entry in our index. The search will help us recover more knowledge about the <I>relationship</I> between doughnuts and the heart. </P>
<P>If we want to enhance our ability to think and conclude about doughnuts and the heart, we might try to remember the following: </P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Fact 1</B>: <I>Doughnuts are high in trans fatty acids</I> 
<LI><B>Rule 1</B>: <I>Trans fatty acids in foods tend to lower <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein">HDLs</A> (high-density lipoproteins)</I> 
<LI><B>Rule 2</B>: <I>Lower blood <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein">HDLs</A> are a major risk factor in cardiovascular disorders (e.g. arteriosclerosis)</I></LI></OL>
<P>There is an advantage to knowing the above facts and rules: upon finding out that <I>French fries are high in trans fatty acids</I>, we will be able to use <B>Rule 1</B> and <B>Rule 2</B> to derive a new fact: <I>French fries ain't good for the heart</I>. The awareness of the above rules will increase our reasoning ability. In the terminology of knowledge engineering, we will be able to derive new facts and rules from the existing set of facts and rules. In plain language, we will know more than we have actually learned. We will be able to conclude more. We will become <I>more intelligent</I> (if intelligence was defined as <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">the inferential ability of the human mind</A>). </P>
<P>Yet there is a downside to remembering the <I>trans fat rules</I>. They are not as plain as the <I>Doughnut Fact</I>, and they may not effectively be refreshed upon a sight of a doughnut. Consequently, we may simply forget the link between <I>doughnuts</I>, <I>trans fat</I>, and <I>the heart</I>. This is where SuperMemo comes to play a role. It will help you refresh the <I>trans fat rules</I>. It will minimize the number of reviews in lifetime. In other words, it will help you keep the <I>trans fat rules</I> in your forgetful memory. Thus SuperMemo makes sure that your "<I>index to knowledge</I>" remains intact in your mind.

<UL>
<LI>If memorization was not needed, we could travel around the world without learning languages. After all, finding out words in a dictionary takes mere seconds 
<LI>If memorization was not needed, students of medicine would not need to cram details of human anatomy and physiology.

<LI>If memorization was not needed, all exams such as SAT, GRE, TEOFL, FCE, GCSE, USMLE, etc. would be a great waste of human time and resources.

<LI>If memorization was not needed, nobody should poke fun at George Bush Jr. for his lack of knowledge of the heads of state of Chechnya, Taiwan, or Pakistan. After all, he can find those names in seconds on his smartphone. If using external storage was permissible, nobody should blame George W. for mixing up Slovakia with Slovenia, or refer to Kosovars as Kosovarians, East Timorese as East Timorians, or Greeks as Grecians (NB: the word <A class="external text" href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=grecian"><I>Grecians</I> is considered correct too</A>) 
<LI>If memorization was not needed, you could be a rocket scientist at NASA tomorrow! After all, rocket scientists follow well-known rules written in well-known manuals organized in a very well-known manner. If you need to plot the trajectory for Galileo to beam images of Europa back to Earth... no problem... take the <I>Advanced Calculus</I> textbook, figure it out, and send your billion dollar mission on course</LI></UL>
<P>The advantage of keeping knowledge in your head as compared to keeping it in external sources can metaphorically be compared to the advantage of going from primary through secondary to university education as opposed to getting a week-long course on digging info from external sources. Nearly all parents seem to prefer to choose the former for their kids.

<UL>
<LI><B>high-retention-low-volume learning</B> (as in early versions of SuperMemo) - in which you make sure you remember 95 or more percent of the studied material 
<LI><B>low-retention-high-volume learning</B> (as in traditional forms of learning) - in which you quickly process large chunks of the material while having to struggle with massive forgetting</LI></UL>
<P>Reading books belongs to the low-retention category, while memorizing 10-20 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1746">items</A> per day with SuperMemo belongs to the high-retention category. The optimum reading strategy will find the golden mean between these two. You should not give up traditional reading. Neither should you expect to put all your study material into SuperMemo. You should choose a middle-ground strategy. For example, if you consistently spend 90% of your time on reading and 10% of your time on adding <B>most important</B> findings to SuperMemo, your reading speed will actually decline only by some 10%, while the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1747">retention</A> of the most important pieces will be as high as programmed in SuperMemo (i.e. usually 95%). </P>
<P><A href="#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</A> provides you with a precise tool for finding the optimum balance between speed and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1748">retention</A>. You will ensure high-retention of the most important pieces of text, while a large proportion of time will be spent reading at speeds comparable or higher than those typical of traditional book reading. </P>
<P>It is worth noting that the learning speed limit in high-retention learning is imposed by your memory. If "memorizing" one-book-per-year sounds like a major disappointment, the roots of this lay in human memory. Our current knowledge of psychophysiology and pharmacology does not provide any means that could allow of breaking beyond those limits. We are left with the choice between high-speed and high-retention. Incremental reading gives you a full hands-on control over finding the optimum balance.

<H3><SPAN id=Myth:_We_are_good_at_remembering_important_things class=mw-headline>Myth: We are good at remembering important things</SPAN></H3>
<P><B>Myth: We are good at remembering important things</B>.<BR><B>Fact</B>: The evolution of the brain proceeds too slowly to have helped us adapt its structures to abstract thinking. What was excellent for survival 200,000 years ago does not suffice to process modern abstract knowledge. Simple computational tasks such as multiplication or division proceed in a shamefully inefficient way in the human mind. After all, early humans did not need to multiply (explicitly and a lot). At the same time, for long, computers found it hard to compete with the visual cortex in pattern recognition and processing. Recognizing the enemy or prey was critical not only for <I>Homo sapiens</I> but also for birds, reptiles, fish or even insects. The only measure of the importance of knowledge our brain synapses have at hand is the pattern of repetition, levels of circulating hormones at the time of exposure, and a limited impact of conscious attentive labeling of information as important at the moment of encoding. Forgetting is needed to optimize knowledge storage; hence we have to forget less important things. Repeated use of the memorized knowledge is a good but far from perfect measure of importance (see: <A href="#Myth:_We_remember_useful_things_because_we_use_them">We remember useful things because we use them</A>) </P>
<P>Modern life has changed the hierarchy of value and importance of knowledge. The link between importance and repeated use has been severed. A flashy lingerie billboard we see every morning is not likely to be more important than dozens of volatile facts pertaining to our professional life. Regrettably, there is no circuit in our brain that would let us consciously etch important memories: <I>This is important! I must not forget it!</I> All we can do is to use the trick of reverberation or mnemonic techniques which... still will usually not last long unless we apply <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="1749">spaced repetition</A> as in SuperMemo. </P>
<P>If memory had an excellent ability to retain important information: </P>
<OL>
<LI>you would not tremble before an exam and confusingly run through the notes to be sure that at the zero hour you won't suffer from a blackout. At the same time, you could easily recall details of a <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzenegger">Schwarzenegger</A> movie seen last evening or even weeks before the exam. Clearly, Arnie beats the ups and downs of the <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman">Ottoman Empire</A>. And if you think the Ottoman Empire had much greater an impact on humanity than the island shootout in <I>Commando</I>, you are still likely to remember the muscle and the machine gun far better than the timeline of the sultans 
<LI>you would never have problems with recalling the date of your mother-in-law's birthday. This is a piece of data that is critical to your marital harmony! 
<LI>you should instantly forget the Olympic champions in football in Atlanta 1996 or Munich 1972. After all this might be a classic case of unimportant knowledge. Yet few Africans would forget how Nigeria beat Argentina 4:3 in 1996. Similarly, few Poles would forget the most memorable moment in the history of Polish football: Olympic championship in Munich.</LI></OL>
<P>The truth is that we excellently remember only things that are both easy to remember and repeated frequently enough. The brain does not have an internal measure of importance (other than limited volitional control or control via repeated exposure)! Your memory storage ruthlessly deletes your career-critical knowledge with the same ease as it ravages the traces of last year's golf scores or contributing names listed at the end of a boring soap opera. SuperMemo will ensure you remember your mission critical data. What is in, stays in your memory. What is out, is free to go.

<P><B>Myth: We remember useful things because we use them</B>.<BR><B>Fact</B>: Not only are we limited in our ability to remember things that we consider important. We cannot even rely on the fact that frequently used memories are remembered better. There are two main reason why frequency of use is not sufficient: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect" data-hasqtip="1750">spacing effect</A></B> (frequently used memories may be very volatile): if you use things often, e.g. a credit card's pin code, you may surprised by a sudden unexpected <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Lapse" oldtitle="Glossary:Lapse" data-hasqtip="1751">lapse of memory</A>! The facts that are used too often or are too obvious, do not challenge the memory system well enough. They are remembered superficially. Any break from use, stress, change of context, or innocent interference from other memories may cause a sudden inability to recall a fact from memory. Even SuperMemo may not help in those cases. Those easy <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1752">items</A> often grow their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1753">intervals</A> fast and cannot prevent the spacing effect. 
<LI><B>tunnel vision</B>: when we rely on frequently used memories, we are slow at expanding our horizons. With <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="1754">spaced repetition</A>, you can quickly grow stable and coherent knowledge into new areas. This expansion is not easy or even possible when relying on frequent use. A conscious intervention is necessary. In an extreme case, you might ask a cat why it does not master mathematics. In a cat's tunnel vision, simple goals lead to a narrow set of factual knowledge that is needed and remembered. A cat will never fly to Mars (on its own).</LI></UL>
<P>Opponents of SuperMemo often say: "<I>Whatever knowledge I need, I use often. If I use it often, I do not forget</I>". This is a false conviction. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect" data-hasqtip="1755">Spacing effect</A> and forgetting are unpredictable. The whole world of useful things escapes your brain on a daily basis. You may say that if need to fly to Mars, you can just read about math tools that you find useful. However, the tool that is useless today might be useful in 5 years, or tomorrow, when you tackle a different problem. You need the whole toolset ready in your mind. The associative power of the extra knowledge just makes you a better problem solver and a stronger thinker. </P>
<P>Tunnel vision effect may be counteracted with extensive reading, however, there is no better way of reading than <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1756">incremental reading</A>.
