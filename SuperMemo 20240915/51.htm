Balance sheets, unlike income statements, are only for a set date. There is no such thing as a balance sheet for the year or quarter. We can create a balance sheet for any day of the year, but it will only be for that specific date. A company&#8217;s accounting department will generate a balance sheet at the end of each fiscal quarter. Think of it as a snapshot of the company&#8217;s financial condition on the particular date that the balance sheet is generated.

<P class=indent>Under liabilities we find two different categories of liabilities: Current Liabilities and Long-Term Liabilities. &#8220;Current liabilities&#8221; means the money that is owed within the year, which includes Cash and Short-Term Investments, Total Inventory, Total Receivables, and Prepaid Expenses.</P>
<P class=indent>Long-term liabilities are those that come due in one year or more, and include the money owed to the vendors that sold us goods, unpaid taxes, bank loans, and bond loans.
