I&#8217;ve rarely seen two people worth exactly the same amount of money. I&#8217;ve never seen three people worth the same amount of money. A lot of people find themselves in this situation, and they ask me how to fix it. I tell them they need to have an honest and frank discussion. A lot of times, I mediate these situations, or if there&#8217;s somebody else in the business who is respected by all the parties, that person will mediate. The people who have this discussion in the early stages of business formation are the ones who succeed. The CEO should usually be the highest paid salaried employee in the business. There are only two positions that might get a higher salary than the CEO. One is a salesperson who&#8217;s on an eat-what-you-kill incentive program. The other is an expert technical person who gets a high salary at the early stage of the business when you have to build the whole business off of that person&#8217;s technical skill set. You might give the technical expert some ownership just for the sake of it, but you&#8217;re really leveraging that person&#8217;s technical ability with your ability to be an entrepreneur. When you have just one technical person who is an expert (and not the CEO) the business is not vibrant enough to pay the CEO more than the expert. Once you have multiple experts on staff and support people, the CEO has a much larger enterprise and can justify the largest salary.

If I hire an employee at below-market rate, market forces dictate that I&#8217;m not going to keep that person forever, and replacement will be more costly in the long run than hiring that employee at the market rate. A high turnover rate is very, very expensive. It also makes it hard to create consistency in the workplace, which can lower productivity, service quality, and customer satisfaction (this is also expensive).

<P class=indent><A id=page_13>There is another major problem with three friends setting up a business and proposing to be paid an equal salary. No one is the leader. Management by committee is an absolute failure as a business model. <SPAN class=cmitalic>There has to be a clear leader even if the stock ownership is equal.</SPAN> If no one is seen as the clear leader and director of the business, it will stagnate very quickly because you won&#8217;t have a focused leader saying, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the way <A id=page_14>forward. You guys follow me!&#8221; You may want to answer salary and leadership questions over a period of time, but you need to make these tough decisions within a couple of years. The success of your business depends on it. Sometimes multiple shareholders have different needs when it comes to salaries. Here&#8217;s another common scenario:</A></P><A id=page_14>
<P class=blockquote>Entrepreneur: <SPAN class=cmitalic>I have a partner and only one of us is taking home a salary because my partner can afford not to. What do we do about straightening out this problem?</SPAN></P>
<P class=blockquote>Greg: <SPAN class=cmitalic>When you&#8217;re in a situation where you&#8217;ve got two shareholders and there&#8217;s not enough profit for everybody to make a market-based wage, you need to account for it as debt as the unpaid salary builds up or as an accrued salary that wasn&#8217;t paid. If you don&#8217;t use either of these approaches, there has to be a shift in equity ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P class=indent>I like the sweat equity solution. Maybe you do it in two phases. You start out with a debt up to a predetermined point, and when the debt reaches that point, you make some equity changes. I&#8217;ve done this in my own business when some of the partners couldn&#8217;t go without compensation. We adjusted the equity based on who could go without a wage and who couldn&#8217;t.</P></A>
