<P class=indent>Assume the following about each example: This is a service-based business that brings in $1.2 million in revenue a year. By the time they take into account federal income taxes and state taxes, their tax rate is 40 percent. The business spends money on its operating costs for a month and then sends invoices at the end of the month. The next month they do the same. By the middle of the third month, they finally get paid for the first month&#8217;s invoices. That&#8217;s the billing cycle in the real world: bill at the end of the month and get paid in forty-five days.</P>
<P class=indent>Exhibit 3.8 is the 5 percent pretax profit graph. The solid line represents cumulative profit and the broken line represents cumulative cash flow.</P>

<P class=indent>This business is immediately $95,000 in the hole in the first month. They go close to $200,000 in the hole before they start earning their way out of it. Notice that it takes over sixty months to break even.</P></A>

<P class=indent>The profit line looks great, but the company is still almost $200,000 in the hole. The cash curve is better, and they hit the breakeven point at about thirty-three months instead of at sixty-plus months. All they changed was one thing: they made all their business decisions based on hitting their profit target.</P></A>

<P class=indent>This is why profit matters. Everybody is going to dig that cash deficit hole in the beginning. It&#8217;s just a matter of how fast you can get out of it. There are really only three ways to remedy the cash deficit hole:</P>
<OL class=olist>
<LI class=nl>You can cover it with debt, but you have to use after-tax profits to pay it back. 
<LI class=nl>You can cover it with sweat equity instead of getting your market-based wage. But how long can you live with or accept less than a market-based wage? 
<LI class=nl>You can get an outside investor, but you have to either repay the investor with after-tax profits or have a good story to persuade the investor that your zero-profit business is worth a lot of money.</LI></OL>
