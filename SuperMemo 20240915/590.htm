<P class=sc><I class=calibre8>I can only dream as far as I can see&#8230;<BR class=calibre9>And when I get there, I can always see farther.</I></P>
<P class=center>&#8211; Anonymous</P>
<P class=noindent1a>The quote above is so true in my case. This book is just another stage of seeing farther than I could have ever imagined. As I looked at the data of many businesses through the lens of my previous book, <I class=calibre8>Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits! </I>(2011), my process continued to evolve as I searched for financial truth through Simple Numbers.</P>
<P class=noindent>In 2014 I was honored to contribute to Verne Harnish&#8217;s book, <I class=calibre8>Scaling Up</I>. It gave me an opportunity to share some of my latest thinking on how to manage profitability through labor efficiency. I showed an example of a common technique I use to isolate components of labor and hold them accountable to an output measure.</P>
<P class=noindent>Through my consulting practice, my team continues to see many companies plagued by bad data that is provided late to the business owner. The accountant thinks they must get it right, which is a noble thought, but it leads to rigid rules that are difficult to apply; and by the time the data is released, its value for analytics has long passed. Business owners dream about timely, useful data. My consulting team delivers it to them, and we train their staff on how to repeatedly provide it.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-119 class=calibre4></A>I was fortunate to have some great entrepreneurs as clients, and my fellow Entrepreneurs&#8217; Organization forum members taught me how accountants should work with them. Accounting standards are needed, but there is a whole world of alternative data presentation methods that often produce better financial truth for running a business. It is my job to provide both data sets: one for running the business, and one for banks and other external data users. But an interesting thing is happening. Once the banks and other users see the alternative data we prepare, they stop asking for traditional presentations and use just the management view (with proper disclosure on how it differs).</P>
<P class=noindent>As our work started to significantly improve companies&#8217; profitability, it opened up more possibilities for them to scale up, and it led me to look not at just profitability, but also, and more importantly, at return on invested capital as the number one key to focus on. In 2016 I was asked to chair an executive education program for the Entrepreneurs&#8217; Organization that was held at the Wharton School, which is the business school at the University of Pennsylvania. The school&#8217;s director of executive education, David Wessels, is an expert on return on invested capital concepts. Hearing Professor Wessels teach on this topic helped me formulate my own ideas about how return on invested capital applies to private companies. I then developed models to evaluate new business investments, and I created a new way to monitor performance and return on investment.</P>
<P class=noindent>As entrepreneurs learn to view their business as an investment vehicle that must provide a return to their investor, they see the enormous power of a privately held business to realize 50% to 100% returns from their invested capital, year, over year, without selling the business. This is why significant wealth can be created from owning a business if (a) you possess the skill to lead it, (b) you have the capital to launch it, and (c) you have the discipline to leave the after-tax profits in it to grow.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-120 class=calibre4></A>This book is designed to give business owners and their teams the necessary understanding to scale smartly, know when to reinvest profits, and know when to harvest profits for other opportunities. By following the principles I outline in this book, you will have the tools needed to create a valuable, profitable business that will reap great financial reward, whether you keep it or sell it.</P>
<P class=noindent>It is my hope this book will let you dream farther, and see farther still once you get there.

<P class=center>&#8211; Greg Crabtree</P>
<P class=noindent1a>I am fortunate to interact with many successful entrepreneurs and get to know the real story of how they achieved success. Through our consulting and accounting practice, we see the most intimate details of those businesses, and I have enough gray hairs to have seen many of them from start to exit.</P>
<P class=noindent>Most people think business is complex, but there is a simple overarching structure to most things, and I believe I have discovered three simple rules to achieve launch <I class=calibre8>and </I>sustainability <I class=calibre8>and </I>a successful exit:</P>
<OL class=calibre10>
<LI class=calibre11 value=1>Figure out what the market needs. 
<LI class=calibre11 value=2>Find a way to do it profitably. 
<LI class=calibre11 value=3>Achieve a 50% or better pretax return on invested capital (ROIC), year over year.</LI></OL>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Does It Meet a Market Need?</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Entrepreneurs have generally been pretty good at figuring this part out. It is not complex; find an unmet need and see what the market will pay for a product or service that fills the gap. It does <A id=calibre_link-204 class=calibre4></A>not have to be something new; it could just be a new way of interfacing with the customer.</P>
<P class=noindent>When we reimagined what entrepreneurs need from an accounting firm, it started with finding out what business owners were not getting from the profession. I used my Entrepreneurs&#8217; Organization forum as my focus group since they fit the profile of who I wanted as clients, but I could not do business with them according to forum rules. This allowed for an unusually strong focus group since they were not my clients, but they were motivated to help me run a better business. The focus group identified the following needs:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Elimination of tax day surprises: </I>Require at least a quarterly review of current-year tax implications, and set aside tax funds as they are earned rather than paying taxes one year behind. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Fixed-price billing: </I>If you bill by the hour, you are either giving away your expertise or charging for your ignorance. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Having an idea of what works (and what does not): </I>The accounting profession lost sight of helping their clients run best-in-class businesses and became more focused on selling billable hours that do not add value. They overlooked the fact that they had the data in their hands to research best practices.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>All of this understanding led our practice away from being a CPA firm that did consulting when it was not tax season to being a consulting firm that provides CPA services only to clients we consult with. We now bill only on a fixed-price basis, and we have essentially turned our services into products. (The only exception is outsourced bookkeeping.) Our focus has changed to studying the data that is in front of us each day, and we develop our own beliefs about critical success factors in business. As a <A id=calibre_link-116 class=calibre4></A>result, we can help when we have a client who wants to create a planned outcome, instead of simply providing a commodity service.</P>
<P class=noindent>Commodity services are still needed, but they come with the burden of having lower margins, and the services are usually delivered by bigger, more capitalized businesses that make competition difficult. If I can find my niche, the &#8220;bigs&#8221; will have trouble competing, and I can be more profitable with much less revenue.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Can You Do It Profitably?</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Now that you have an idea to fill a market need, can you deliver it in a way that will appeal to customers and still make a profit? This is usually where entrepreneurs get trapped into revenue thinking instead of margin thinking. Part of the solution to better serve your customers may be reselling someone else&#8217;s goods or services and adding your labor to tie it all together. Think of those outside goods and services as pass-through costs because they are bait to attract the more profitable part of the transaction that you perform.</P>
<P class=noindent>In my previous book, <I class=calibre8>Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!</I>, I hypothesized that at 5% profit you would barely break even in cash flow, at 10% you would have a good business, and at 15% you would have a great business. I came up with those levels by observation, and they still work for about 70% of businesses. However, I saw that there were outliers that could have a lower profit and still were great businesses. Many of them had low gross margins and relied on volume, but others who tried this strategy failed miserably. I also noticed that some businesses attempted high-margin models and failed, so margin had to be just one element of the solution. There was a missing piece. The trail to solve the mystery led me to the document most entrepreneurs struggle to understand and rarely look at: the balance sheet!</P>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-121 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Does It Meet the Minimum ROIC Standard?</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>I discovered the missing piece when I started researching ROIC. Later I will detail how to measure and evaluate that metric and how to use it to set your profit target. The questions are: Of the capital I invest into my business, does net income provide a reasonable return? Do I have access to the required capital through my own cash, investors, or debt?</P>
<P class=noindent>To whet your appetite for the later discussion of ROIC, let me tease you with a number: 50%. Based on our research for businesses in the US and Canada, the minimum acceptable ROIC should be no less than 50%, and the average across most industries is 75%.</P>
<P class=noindent>I have often said that if someone can demonstrate their ability to run a profitable business, it is not that hard to get access to capital. The challenge is how to demonstrate you can do it if you do not have the capital to pull it off yourself. This is when you can develop a minimum viable product, create a &#8220;test kitchen,&#8221; or start small with what you can fund to prove the concept. After the proof of concept, outside capital is often not needed for growth. You can grow as fast as you can manage it just by reinvesting your own profits with perhaps some temporary financing from the bank. Certainly, some big initiatives require a lot of infrastructure, but the vast majority of new initiatives do not. The business grows by adding the next productive team member, the next profitable customer, the next profitable location&#8212;one at a time.</P>
<P class=noindent>Since we have been using this approach to help our clients evaluate growth and new business initiatives, it really makes them pause when a new plan has no potential to meet the 50% ROIC standard, and it sheds light on why nobody else may have been successful. If you are in this situation, see if you can change either the profitability or the capital requirement.</P>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-103 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Can You Change the Profitability?</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>The error most entrepreneurs make in estimating profit is to start with a cost-build-up pricing model to determine what they should charge. While I agree that costs are important, I prefer to start with the price my target customer is willing to pay, then see what the minimum cost would be to deliver.</P>
<P class=noindent>Smaller niche businesses have more pricing power since they are not big enough to attract a predatory well-funded large business to drive the price down through competition. Leveraging technology to enhance labor productivity is another key to profitability. Also, never forget that plain old world-class execution is your best protection from competitors and is a profit generator. Very few businesses can really deliver.</P>
<P class=noindent>Another way to look at profitability enhancement is to share part of the transaction with another business, particularly if you have weaknesses in some aspect of fulfillment. Good metrics show that 30% to 40% of any transaction&#8217;s value is the sales, marketing, and customer service component, whereas delivery of the product or service is 60% to 70%. If you can share the customer with someone else, you can negotiate good terms that specify you do not pay them until you get paid, which lowers your capital need. We will look at that in detail later when we discuss the capital signature of your business model.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Can You Change the Capital Requirement?</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>It has been enlightening to see our clients respond to the challenge of reducing their capital requirements when their business idea falls short of the 50% return. The best time to get better terms from your suppliers and customers is when you start a new activity. Once customers and vendors become accustomed to your terms, it is difficult to change them unless you are in a power position. Even if you have power, it can sometimes <A id=calibre_link-86 class=calibre4></A>damage the relationship and possibly damage your customer or vendor as well since they are not prepared for the change.</P>
<P class=noindent>For starters, here are a few techniques to reduce your capital requirements:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Try to get the entire payment in advance, or get as large of a payment as possible in advance, as long as the remaining payment does not take so long that it negates the benefit of the up-front payment. 
<LI class=calibre11>Maintain tighter inventory control over slow-moving stock (but never run out of key items). 
<LI class=calibre11>Take credit card payments for some or all transactions. Even though your merchant fee can be 2% to 3%, it might be worth it if you lack capital to fund the activity, not to mention the labor cost of chasing down payments and bad debts. One of my favorite Gregisms is &#8220;Never make it hard for someone to give you money.&#8221; 
<LI class=calibre11>Get extended terms from vendors if you are selling products or subcontracted services. It is common for a company&#8217;s subcontractors to get paid after the company itself gets paid. 
<LI class=calibre11>For ongoing services, charge a fixed monthly fee that keeps you equal to or slightly ahead of the effort required to provide those services. If the start of services requires up-front effort, try to offset it with an up-front fee that equals or exceeds the cost of the initial effort so you do not dig a cash hole from the start. 
<LI class=calibre11>Turn a capital cost into an operating expense. If your activity requires equipment or a retail store buildout, finance the cost and turn the payment into an operating <A id=calibre_link-160 class=calibre4></A>expense over the useful life of the item being financed. Your profit will be lower because of the payment, but your yield will still be accelerated. If you use financing, you need to have a greater certainty of success and you need to be willing to pay off the debt if the business fails.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Understanding these three rules is a great example of the Hawthorne Effect, where people modify their behavior just because they are being observed. When we educated one of our clients in the staffing industry on the interrelationship of these rules, they created new offerings for their customers that were more profitable, they got paid faster, and the customer got a project billing structure they preferred over standard hourly billing. That led to profit going from 3% to 10% and ROIC rising from 23% to 51%. Half of the rise in ROIC was due to the profit, but the other half was due to needing less capital because they were getting paid faster. They saw more opportunity once they were aware of the power to be found in the interplay of these three rules. In other words, they went from playing checkers to playing chess!</P>
<P class=noindent>The good thing about being an entrepreneur is that you get to decide on the strategy. If you match the market need to the profit model and the capital model, you will be successful&#8212;assuming you can execute!

<P class=center>&#8211; Warren Buffett</P>
<P class=noindent1a>A great error for entrepreneurs is to not think like an investor. Whether you are just starting a business or have owned one for many years, you must think like an investor to maximize the value of your business. For most industries, you should take more of a long-term investor mindset like Warren Buffett would&#8212; patient and demanding but seeking the balance of profitability and growth. If you are in the tech industry, you must have a faster internal clock since your business can become irrelevant much faster. To help my clients understand how their business fits their investment thinking, I have developed the following structure that encompasses every business model I have worked with.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-281 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-314 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>The Three Business Value Plays</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Many entrepreneurs hear about companies that were sold and made them rich, and they get motivated to make the same thing happen for them. This can be a good thing if the entrepreneur&#8217;s characteristics match those in the success story they heard, but unfortunately, most of the time they do not. Because I am often faced with this situation among my clients, I put some thought and <A id=calibre_link-175 class=calibre4></A>research into how I can frame the situation to give them direction, and I came up with the following three business value plays:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Run to harvest 
<LI class=calibre11>Harvest to premium sale 
<LI class=calibre11>Build to sell</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>We have clients in all three of these scenarios. It is important to understand the differences so you can implement an effective strategy.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-282 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-315 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Run to Harvest</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Run to harvest is the most common business model among privately held businesses, and it has made many entrepreneurs significantly wealthy. When this type of business is run at its best, it can be very profitable, but it may be operationally difficult to scale. It usually does not have recurring revenue streams for any great length of time. Customers may be loyal, or &#8220;sticky,&#8221; but only to the owner or a key staff member.</P>
<P class=noindent>This type of business also struggles to exceed much more than $5 million in revenue, which keeps it below the target of private equity funds as a purchase target. As a rule, this type of business attracts only four to five times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) as a sale value, and much of that is subject to an earnout because of the perceived lack of stickiness of the customers and the difficulty of continued operations.</P>
<P class=noindent>While those may seem like negatives, business owners who have this type of business might still achieve significant wealth creation if they follow the principles outlined in my first book, <I class=calibre8>Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits! </I>It is imperative that business owners pay themselves a market wage for their role in <A id=calibre_link-94 class=calibre4></A>the business (it is okay if that wage is at the top of the market), and they must use the after-tax profits of the business to smartly grow it as the market allows. Once the business has grown as far as the market allows, business owners should use the after-tax profits to diversify into other investments (such as another business, real estate, or the stock market). If you run your business on these principles, it will give you a better investment return than anything in real estate or the stock market, so be sure to fully capitalize your business before you do anything else with the profits.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-303 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-316 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Harvest to Premium Sale</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>When the harvest to premium sale model applies, it is my favorite strategy because it gives you the best of both worlds: you can keep your business and grow it, or you can sell it and get a significant premium on the sale.</P>
<P class=noindent>The main characteristic of this business model is very sticky customers. They are either contractually bound, or it costs them a lot to go elsewhere. We see this primarily in subscription software sales. It is not impossible for customers to switch software platforms, but they will not endure the pain and suffering involved unless the current platform is unbearable or someone else&#8217;s offering is too good to pass up.</P>
<P class=noindent>Just because your customers are under contract with you does not guarantee a premium sale. In government contracting, you are generally given only the value of current contracts because there are no guaranteed renewals. However, you may be paid a premium if you are an approved vendor under a broad contract that allows only a handful of other vendors to provide products and services. In essence, the buyer is paying a premium for your government contract as a hunting license for task orders and thinks they can outbid the other limited vendors.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-95 class=calibre4></A>Premiums are sometimes paid for highly skilled teams that are hard to assemble. When the hiring market is competitive and a company needs to move fast, they can buy a small company, with a nice premium, to get their labor. We have seen businesses with under $5 million in revenue be paid one times revenue to acquire their team, even if the business is operating at breakeven or a loss.</P>
<P class=noindent>The ability to scale up is another key characteristic of the harvest to premium sale model. You might create a business that could scale, but you do not have the energy or passion for it, or maybe you do not want to risk the capital. Private equity firms love to look at these types of businesses and are willing to pay a premium, if you hold them to it. Therefore, it is always a good idea to plan how to scale, even if you sell your business to someone else and they scale it.</P>
<P class=noindent>Recurring revenue is always a hot incentive for buyers to offer a premium, but there is a good side and a bad side to this. On the good side, when recurring revenue fits the product or service, it works great. On the bad side, when you try to force a recurring revenue model onto a business where it does not fit, you can damage a good business and significantly underprice your services.</P>
<P class=noindent>The most common recurring revenue models are in maintenance services, such as for homes (pest control; alarm systems; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning etc.) or for software or equipment. Many businesses that resell technical equipment find they can take a very low margin on the original sale of the equipment if they also sell a three-year maintenance agreement. As I said earlier, if you focus on gross margin instead of revenue, you can get creative with structuring sales to give up margin in some areas and make it up in others. In the capital cost of the transaction, do not forget to factor in how long you can wait to get paid and when you have to pay your costs.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-114 class=calibre4></A>The most common error in recurring revenue is trying to turn an inconsistently needed service into a monthly fee. You might be successful at selling it the first time, but the customer will not renew because they did not get value from regularly paying for something they do not always need. The worst case is when you agree to a service level you cannot afford. Either there is no contractual exit for scope creep, or there is no clear definition of when the scope has been exceeded.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=calibre_link-317 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Build to Sell</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Build to sell is the rarest value play. It can work, but it leaves a big crater when it fails. The most common example of this strategy is in software development, but we have also seen it used in harvest to premium sale models when the entrepreneur is great at getting a business off the ground but gets bored running it. In those cases, their strategy is to max out the reinvestment of aftertax profits and apply internal leverage to spur growth to an optimum sale point.</P>
<P class=noindent>In software development, you typically start with a minimum viable product and get some customers to provide market validation and feedback on needed enhancements. It is usually at this point when you decide to either attract outside capital or pass on outside investors if you can generate enough internal profits to fund development.</P>
<P class=noindent>Regardless of the industry, the critical piece is being sure the market values what you are building. My experience with a client tells a cautionary tale. The client had 45 stores in the retail outlet sector. The CEO (who was not the owner) and I had developed a maximum profit and value plan that said to hold growth at 45 stores, which was the maximum capacity of their central warehouse. The plan was to close the five worst-performing stores each year and open five new stores in more promising markets. Given the structure of outlet mall leases for their store <A id=calibre_link-158 class=calibre4></A>size, it was inexpensive to open a new store, rents were usually based on percentage of sales, and there was minimal cost to get out of a lease. The CEO and I agreed that in their niche there were probably not many more than 45 good store locations due to customer demand.</P>
<P class=noindent>The owner, on the other hand, came from a real estate background and always thought bigger was better and wanted to open more stores. The CEO and I explained that we did not think the market would support more than 45 store locations, their warehouse did not have the capacity to serve more stores than that, and, given that the owner liked to deplete all the cash after the Christmas sale season (which led to lean summers), the company did not have the capital to carry more stores. But the owner prevailed and gave the full-steam-ahead order to expand to 75 stores.</P>
<P class=noindent>This is where Ernest Hemingway comes in. In his book <I class=calibre8>The Sun</I> <I class=calibre8>Also Rises </I>there are two characters who have this discussion:</P>
<P class=bk>&#8220;How did you go bankrupt?&#8221; Bill asked.</P>
<P class=bk>&#8220;Two ways,&#8221; Mike said. &#8220;Gradually and then suddenly.&#8221;</P>
<P class=noindent>I thank Pascal Finette at Singularity University for sharing this quote in a keynote address he gave at the EO San Francisco University in 2018. As soon as I heard the quote, it took me back to this experience. It is amazing how long a person can hang on even though a business is dead. It was not my business, but as an advisor I hated to witness the death march, waiting for one final event to push it over the edge.</P>
<P class=noindent>There will never be a premium sale in this type of situation, so if your business is gradually getting in trouble, seriously evaluate your realistic options so fate does not suddenly overcome you.</P>

<P class=scl><A id=calibre_link-148 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Run to Harvest Example</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>This example is a composite of businesses in the in-home senior care industry, which sends caregivers into homes to help homebound patients with their daily needs. The following are decriptions of the key characteristics:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Customer funded: No. </I>There is very little opportunity to get paid in advance, so it is not a customer-funded business. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Recurring revenue: No. </I>While you might argue that the revenue is recurring, the average length of contracts does not support it. A few contracts could last beyond a year, but most fall well short of that time frame. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>High use of labor: Yes. </I>This is a labor-heavy industry that uses low-wage workers and occasionally nurses. The labor turnover can be high, and a lot of caregivers are needed to satisfy the staffing needs. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Sticky customers: No. </I>Some customers become very attached to a certain caregiver, and that can be good or bad. The customer is sticky to the caregiver, not the company, and if the favored caregiver is not available, the customer might look at your competitors. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Perceived scalability: Low. </I>Businesses in this industry are grown one case at a time and can get to sustainability within a year, but it is difficult to grow fast, and there tend to be only a few large companies with locations in multiple cities. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Ability to create: High. </I>There are multiple franchise opportunities, which bring independence, and an owner/ operator can launch with minimal capital and very few regulatory barriers in most areas.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-108 class=calibre4></A>You may look at these characteristics as challenges, but many business owners in this industry have built great businesses that are profitable. In the example shown in table 2.1, this owner would be making $600,000 profit over their market wage of $150,000 to $175,000 per year. At this level of profit, they could easily have access to $300,000 of after-tax cash to invest in other things to build wealth. While the business might not sell for a premium, the owner would still get a decent price for the business, especially if they provide terms to facilitate the transaction in a sale to their management team. (There are pros and cons to that idea!) Given the limited barrier to entry and low up-front capital, this would still be a good business given the economics. To use a baseball analogy, this business will give you enough hits to make the Hall of Fame; you won&#8217;t strike out very often, but you won&#8217;t win the home run title.</P></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-319 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Harvest to Premium Sale Example</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>This example is based on a product sales business. As in most businesses, it can be started with minimal capital (less than $20,000) and will build equity to $5 million by retaining some, but not all, profits each year. This business example is representative of what I call the &#8220;necessaries&#8221; type of business&#8212;nothing flashy or techie, just a well-run business providing what the market needs for a fair price and offering good customer service. The following are descriptions of the key characteristics:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Customer funded: No. </I>The company has to invoice its customers and carry inventory, although it gets some favorable vendor terms from its suppliers. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Recurring revenue: No. </I>The products they sell are consumable, so there is not a recurring supplies component. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>High use of labor: No. </I>Since the products they sell are manufactured on a contract basis, most labor is focused <A id=calibre_link-109 class=calibre4></A>on sales and customer service, with a high leverage to margin per labor dollar. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Sticky customers: Yes. </I>Even though there are competing products, this company&#8217;s products are used in a process that would be annoying for their customers to change. This helps drive a premium. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Perceived scalability: Moderate. </I>The company&#8217;s products are widely used, and scaling up could result from attracting large customers with high-volume needs and executing an effective sales process. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Ability to create: Moderate. </I>The barrier is the capital need for initial setup and reaching initial sustainability. The products may have some patent protection, which helps boost the value, but most patents can be worked around, depending on your appetite for legal fees. The challenge is to win sticky customers who would need a reason to change suppliers.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>Because of the sticky customers, perceived scalability, and ability to create, the sale of this business could attract a premium if the owner plays their cards right. By understanding what their business is worth, they could say no until a buyer offers a price that makes it worthwhile to sell, versus holding on until the next buyer comes along. When investor money is plentiful, the most common examples are roll-ups in industries like auto service, landscaping, equipment maintenance, and home services. Essentially, it is anything that has a recurring customer at a relatively fixed price for service that allows for gains from operational efficiency with size.</P>
<P class=scl><A id=calibre_link-89 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Build to Sell Example</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>This example is based on a software subscription business. The vast majority of my software subscription clients have an eventual plan to sell their business. The speed of the process usually depends on whether they take outside funds or not. If they are profitable enough to fund their own development, I caution them to know when they are done.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H2 id=calibre_link-320 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>The Fall of Peachtree Accounting</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>When you launch software to a niche market, you can charge a premium price, and there is a mutual benefit to you and your customers. But at some point you must test the broader market to grow, and sometimes that requires you to cannibalize your existing software pricing to reach the bigger market. When Peachtree Accounting launched back in the late 1980s, they charged $5,000 for their system. When QuickBooks launched, it cost around $300 and fit more users&#8217; needs than Peachtree ever thought about. There was no way Peachtree was going to drop their price to compete with the upstart QuickBooks. Love them or hate them, QuickBooks became the dominant business accounting system by using the profits generated from their successful Quicken product to attack the business market.</P></DIV>
<P class=noindent>The following are descriptions of the key characteristics:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Customer funded: Yes</I>. Many customers might pay for a oneto three-year subscription, which is deferred revenue, so the business owner developed a strong understanding of the difference between profit and cash flow early in their business life. 
<LI class=calibre11><A id=calibre_link-149 class=calibre4></A><I class=calibre8>Recurring revenue: Yes. </I>When a company can provide core operating software for an industry, renewals can run between 60% and 80%. Those who do not renew typically never fully implemented and committed to using the software. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>High use of labor: No. </I>The cost of labor for ongoing development is not cheap, but not many skilled employees are needed. The sales process is reasonably efficient, but the sales cycle is long. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Sticky customers: Yes. </I>Once a customer implements the software, they are not likely to change. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Perceived scalability: High. </I>There is still plenty of market to penetrate. The software is mature, but a better sales process is needed. 
<LI class=calibre11><I class=calibre8>Ability to create: Low. </I>It would be difficult to rebuild from scratch, and the slow sales cycle is a detriment to new competitors.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>In an example like this, the founders usually have to take less than a market wage in the beginning to reduce the initial burn rate. If you can get customers to pay up front, the company will have cash, and because you can use an accrual basis for taxes, you will have few tax consequences despite having cash because the tax is pushed into future years. The challenge in this example is how to not waste profits on ineffective sales and marketing and how to avoid making software enhancements that do not change potential customers&#8217; buying choices.</P>
<P class=noindent>Sometimes tech companies think they should spend all their profits to grow. I am all for that strategy when you have a good idea and execute it effectively. But if you are not effective, hold on to the profits until you have a really good idea of what will <A id=calibre_link-124 class=calibre4></A>work. My consulting firm has seen this situation many times, so we developed a concept called launch capital that helps our clients be rigorous in holding reinvestments accountable. (I will talk about launch capital in Chapter 6.)</P>
<P class=noindent>It is not uncommon for companies in this situation to have multiple years as zero EBITDA, yet sell for anywhere between 2 and 10 times revenue. That can make up for some wasted profits that did not yield results, but there is some opportunity to harvest a bit of profit in most situations like this. Not every business can get that high a revenue multiplier, but each situation gives clues as to what the buyers will consider.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Understanding Your Business as an Investment</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>As a privately held business owner, you do not have a third party like the stock market to establish a share price for you on a daily basis. This is actually a blessing since the stock market daily price is full of emotion, and there is very little technical understanding of the true value of a business. Imagine what the stock price would be for a publicly traded business if there were total transparency of its current financial position, future plans, and forecasts, without any spin!</P>
<P class=noindent>If you, as the owner, establish an understanding of and a framework for valuing your business, you are the person who sets the value of your business on a consistent basis. This is critical if you have partners, decide to share equity with key team members, or have compensation plans based on growing the value of your business.</P>
<P class=noindent>But before we discuss the value of your business, you must first have an understanding of return on investment and, more importantly, return on invested capital (ROIC) of your business, which is likely the most valuable asset in your wealth profile.</P>
<P class=scl><A id=calibre_link-106 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Rate of Return Expectation</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>As an experiment, find an entrepreneur who has not read this book or heard my speeches about rate of return, and ask them this simple question: what should you expect as an annual rate of return on your investment without selling your business? You will likely get answers that range from 10% to 20%. Those percentages come from the generally held belief that the stock market returns somewhere in that range over a period of 10-plus years. But this is a misunderstanding that stems from several points:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>Public market returns are calculated off the market value at the time of investment, not invested capital. 
<LI class=calibre11>Entrepreneurs do not understand the concept of invested capital. 
<LI class=calibre11>Entrepreneurs do not have a commonly held definition of what a return on investment is. 
<LI class=calibre11>There is a misperception that publicly traded companies have higher returns than private companies. This is why a discount is applied for lack of marketability when a private company is valued. Given the recent demand to purchase private businesses, you could argue that the discount for lack of marketability has been significantly reduced.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-243 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-321 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Invested Capital</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Think of invested capital as money you put in. Debt is not invested capital; it is just a placeholder that must eventually be replaced with real capital. Sweat equity (working a job in the business at less than market wage) can be, and should be, considered invested capital. It is money you put in, but you did not account for it properly. So for our discussions, invested capital is money that the owners put in, plus sweat equity.</P>
<P class=scl><A id=calibre_link-97 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Returns</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>If you buy a bond or certificate of deposit, there is a stated interest rate. Quite simply, what you get in interest is your return on what you invested, and your rate of return is the interest divided by what you originally invested. You can often renew a certificate of deposit and leave some or all of the interest in it for reinvestment. When you add the interest, it increases your original investment. Most of these calculations use pretax returns for evaluation.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-258 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-322 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Sample Business Case</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Let&#8217;s apply the concepts of invested capital and returns to a sample business case. Your pretax profit is simply your annual return on your investment, and you have to pay tax on your profit. In this sample case, assume that the cash for taxes will come from the business, regardless of whether the business pays the tax directly or if the profit flows through to your personal tax return and you pay the tax personally. If you decide to leave some or all of the profits in the business, your invested capital increases by the amount you retain in the business.</P>
<P class=noindent>In table 2.2, the business owner invested $100,000 to start the business and performs a job within the business that should pay $100,000 per year, but they go without pay in the first year (sweat equity). This is the same as putting $200,000 into a business as an investor and hiring someone else to run it. After the first year, the owner begins to take a market wage but leaves the sweat equity in the invested capital calculation, remembering that it was a key part of the original investment.</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-98 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 2.2</B></P>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Sample case: Invested capital and returns</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00026.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent>Table 2.2 assumes an average tax rate of 40% and assumes that all after-tax profits were left in the business as retained earnings, which also adds to the invested capital balance. This example is uncommon for a start-up business that does $1 million to $2 million in revenue during the first couple of years in business, mostly because many entrepreneurs try to withdraw the early profits or waste them in an effort to avoid paying taxes. The scenario in this sample business case <I class=calibre8>should be the norm </I>for early capitalization, and it is what we advise our clients to do. Unfortunately, a lot of entrepreneurs do not understand this strategy, and it leads to early failures for start-ups.</P>
<P class=noindent>Notice the ROIC in table 2.2. In the first year, the business owner got 38%, which is no different than investing $200,000 in a certificate of deposit with a 38% interest rate. You would have earned $100,000 in interest, paid 40% tax (or $40,000), and if you are like most people, you would have reinvested the profits. Technically, the rate of return is 50% ($100,000 pretax net income divided by $200,000 original capital), but table 2.2 shows the year-1 after-tax net income as part of the capital base, like a <A id=calibre_link-127 class=calibre4></A>normal balance sheet, since you do have access to cash generated from profits during the year to help you make more profit.</P>
<P class=noindent>If you think 38% ROIC is good in year 1, it increases to more than 50% in years 2 and 3 (see table 2.2). I have studied the business profit and capital structure of hundreds of businesses. Every business that was at the proper capitalization levels and had less than 50% ROIC struggled with cash flow and sustainability. If a business is highly leveraged, the ROIC will be even higher, but it is a false sense of success since it comes from overleveraging the business, and it will suffer if credit becomes tight. The only sustainable businesses with an ROIC less than 50% are the ones that have excess cash in the business (that is, beyond two months of operating expenses).</P>
<P class=noindent>An ROIC of 50% or more is a pretty good rate of return without selling the business! A high rate of return like this puts you in an optimal position to demand a premium sale price for your business, or you can walk away.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Real-World Business Case</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Since we use a common profit and loss format (our proprietary Simple Numbers Profit Model, discussed in Chapter 5) for the clients we work with, it is easy to aggregate data so we can study trends and business outcomes in our client base. The data in table 2.3 comes from 50 companies we work with across the US from all the basic industries (manufacturing, retail, services, and technology). By using an aggregate of 50 companies, the outcome is far more compelling than data from a single business. In selecting the 50 companies, we did not pick just the winners; we chose the first 50 companies for which we had complete data during the time period we studied and who we thought we would have ongoing data from so we could continue to study economic trends.</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-99 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 2.3</B></P>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Real-world case: Invested capital and returns</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00023.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent>The beginning invested capital in year 1 represents the equity balance to start the first year of analysis. Many of the companies in this data set had sweat equity, but that number is not shown in table 2.3.</P>
<P class=noindent>Table 2.3 presents a good waterfall view of what really happens in business:</P>
<OL class=calibre10>
<LI class=calibre11 value=1>Invest capital. 
<LI class=calibre11 value=2>Make a profit. 
<LI class=calibre11 value=3>Pay tax on the Profit. 
<LI class=calibre11 value=4><A id=calibre_link-67 class=calibre4></A>Decide how much after-tax profit to reinvest in the business. 
<LI class=calibre11 value=5>Distribute after-tax profits that were not needed for growth. 
<LI class=calibre11 value=6>Repeat!</LI></OL>
<P class=noindent>In the group of 50 companies represented in table 2.3, the revenue growth was between 14% and 20% for three years! None of them needed outside capital for growth, and as a group they averaged 1.5 months of operating expenses in cash (all labor costs plus operating expenses). This flies in the face of the common belief that you need outside capital to grow. Not only did these companies grow without outside capital, they distributed cash profits of 27% to 29% to the investors each year. The profit distribution varies from year to year since it cannot be determined until after taxes and reinvestments.</P>
<P class=noindent>I have not mentioned anything about revenue other than the annual growth rate. Revenue is the most slippery number on your profit and loss statement. It is just the start of the math. The real key performance indicators you should focus on are ROIC and the volume of your investment. If you compound interest at a rate of 50% to 100%, it grows quite nicely, as shown in table 2.4.</P>
<P class=noindent>Of our clients who are skilled at running a business, I would say that 75% ROIC is the most common data point. For our clients who have over $5 million in revenue, the average moves closer to 90%. As you get bigger, your cost structure should get more efficient. The challenge companies face is reinvesting in the business and getting the same return. Effectively reinvesting requires two things: (a) the market must accept your product or service at the current price point; and (b) if the market demands more, you need to be able to deliver at the same, or a better, cost.</P>
<P class=imgc><A id=calibre_link-224 class=calibre4></A><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00013.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-68 class=calibre4></A>When an entrepreneur says they could grow if they had access to capital, they really mean they could grow if they could use someone else&#8217;s cash who could afford to lose it if their idea does not work. They are not willing to spend their own profits and risk losing them if they are wrong about what it takes to grow. That may sound harsh, but the data suggests it is true. In our 50- company data set, the entrepreneurs took out roughly a third of their profits to do other things. As much as you might like to think they were using the funds to diversify their investments, the funds were mostly used for consumption. Also, keep in mind that all these companies are following our guidelines for market-based wages for the job they do in the business, and most of them are at the high end of the market-based wage range.</P>
<P class=noindent>There is nothing wrong with consumption, but it does speak to how entrepreneurs truly act. Any business owner who consumes profits from the business to fund their lifestyle is on a slippery road to entrepreneurial hell because there will be some years when the business will not make a profit, but the consumption will continue. The only source to fund consumption in those years is to diminish the capital base of the business or, even worse, use company debt sources to keep up distribution demands. This is the key reason why businesses fail during recessions. Our clients thrived during the previous recession, and many had their most profitable years because they were fully capitalized and could take advantage of their weakened competitors.</P>
<P class=noindent>Entrepreneurs become more risk averse as they become more successful and make enough to live on comfortably. There is a place for outside capital, and there is a place for reinvestment of profits; you need to be aware of when to use which strategy. Many entrepreneurs who raise outside capital do not focus on getting profitable quickly enough, and this leads to many avoidable start-up failures. On the other hand, you need to know how to set expectations for the returns needed on reinvestments, and you need to hold your team accountable for results.</P>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-69 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>The Black Art of Marketing for Growth</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>I was having dinner one night with my good friend Dan Martell, and we were discussing business (as I am prone to do). A thought hit me about how simple (but not easy) it is to grow a business. I told Dan, &#8220;If you can figure out what the market needs, find a way to do it profitably, and it makes a good return on investment, all that is left is to tell everybody about it.&#8221; Since then, as I applied that thought to my clients, I have found that it encompasses the root of the challenge. Notice that it does not say anything about finding money. If I can make a profit doing whatever the market needs, money is not a problem. The growth plan will usually fund itself from profits as fast as I can grow, or I can find capital if I need an up-front investment. I have yet to see a good marketfocused growth initiative that cannot get funded.</P>
<P class=noindent>If you can find a market need, figuring out how to satisfy it profitably is the easiest part of the equation. The marketing piece is still a bit of a black art. As much as the marketing pros will try to tell you they know how to market your idea if you spend enough, I see more activity than accomplishment in many high-spend campaigns. The real challenge comes when the market becomes insensitive to what has been working, and you have to keep changing your approach. It is almost like driving 100 miles per hour at night with no headlights. The occasional streetlight gives you a glimpse of the road, but not enough to stay out of the ditch.</P>
<P class=noindent>The main challenge to growth is a poor understanding of what the market needs and an unwillingness to risk profits that you are used to consuming. As the data set from 50 companies showed, those entrepreneurs were motivated to take about a third of the profits out of their business (see table 2.3).

<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-118 class=calibre13></A><B class=calibre5>Are Entrepreneurs Like Cab Drivers?</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>A classic behavioral economic study looked at cab drivers in New York City. A cab driver rented their car for 12-hour shifts. When the fares were sparse, the cab driver would sit in their car hoping for fares all day. When the fares were plentiful, they quit work at 2:00 p.m. and went home early. At the time of the study, the economists identified $500 of daily earnings as the point at which they stopped being motivated to stay on shift. Could it be that most entrepreneurs quit risking their cash once they have reached their subconscious consumption goal?</P></DIV>
<P class=noindent>I think this is why the second business is the hardest to start for entrepreneurs. They are usually unwilling to do for the second business what made them successful the first time. I often counsel entrepreneurs to consider this before they sell their first business. I suggest that they might consider starting the second business before they sell the first one to make sure they can repeat their success.</P>
<P class=noindent>If you take the time to understand ROIC with the potential for 75% to 100% returns, wouldn&#8217;t you be more focused on growing your business when opportunities arise?

<P class=sc><I class=calibre8>Price is what you pay, value is what you get.</I></P>
<P class=center>&#8211; Warren Buffett</P>
<P class=noindent1a>Now that we have established a framework to understand your business from an investment standpoint, we can assess its value and implement a decision-making tool to help you decide when to sell your business, or keep it, based on the economics.</P>
<P class=noindent>The marketplace can be a cruel taskmaster when it comes to valuing your business. In my experience, the first offer that starts the selling discussion never goes any higher once the term sheet is signed, so you must get the value right before the initial negotiation. The market sees every business model differently, so it tends to overvalue sexy businesses at times.</P>
<P class=noindent>It is also important to understand the buyer&#8217;s purchasing power. If the buyer has enough cash to cover the purchase, they can pay more if they choose to. If the buyer is funding the purchase from future cash flows (a seller-held note or a bank loan), the value of the business will be limited to how much can be funded from that cash flow, which will limit the company&#8217;s growth until the note or loan is substantially paid down. Since the vast majority of buyers try to fund their purchase from future cash flows, you need to understand how that valuation works.</P>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-100 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Economic Value</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>In my previous book, <I class=calibre8>Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big</I> <I class=calibre8>Profits!</I>, I developed a formula to determine the economic value of a business. It blends both the profits and the capital in a business, and it has proven to be quite robust in bringing clarity to the value of a business. We have successfully used this formula for private company buy/sell agreements, stock awards, stock options, and phantom stock plans in situations when a value formula is needed instead of an appraised value.</P>
<P class=noindent>The formula was originally based on the common problem of how to buy out a 50% partner. I asked fellow entrepreneurs this question: how many years are you willing to give up all of the company&#8217;s after-tax profits to get your 50% partner out of your life? Many entrepreneurs who had never bought out a partner said two to three years. The ones who had bought out a partner said five years.</P>
<P class=noindent>Next I looked at multiple data sets to prove the math. The outcome was my valuation formula that employs a blend of profit and capital. I found that if a company is operating on a stable level of profit, you would take the last three years of pretax net income plus the equity (assets minus liabilities) at the date of the sale (see table 3.1).</P>
<P class=noindent>In table 3.1 the company is maintaining its profits around 10% and is retaining very little of the profits each year to add to equity. Since profitability is stable, it is more accurate to use the last three years as the net income period for evaluation than to use the most recent year times three. Had profitability been falling, the buyer might argue that you should take the most recent year times three, or weight the most recent year heavier than the previous two years, to establish the true value.</P>

<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Economic value example</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt=""></P>
<P class=noindent>Table 3.2 proves the math to buy out a 50% partner. In this scenario, the partner who is buying would have to use 100% of the after-tax profits for 51 months to complete the buyout. In most situations when I have used this calculation, the length of the payoff is from four to six years. This formula is a good starting point to help you determine if you should buy out a 50% partner when no outside cash is available.</P></DIV></DIV>

<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-219 class=calibre4></A>Many entrepreneurs think they can accelerate the buyout or leverage it. The only business that can grow its way into an accelerated payoff is one that does not need additional working capital to grow. If the company requires growth in accounts receivable or inventory, it is very difficult to pay off a buyout faster. The only situation where I have seen a faster payoff is when the exiting partner was a barrier to growth and the company hit new highs in both profit and growth once that partner was out of the business.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-259 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-324 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Market Value</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>There is a very good reason why an outside investor may pay a market value higher than my economic value calculation. Money chases easy, while entrepreneurs overcome hard. Given the alternative investments available for money to gravitate toward, a profitable business can still yield significantly more than market investments and, if you have money, you do not have to endure the building of a business. The founder gets a nice value for the business they built, and the investor can take it to the next level and often infuse new energy and structure the business to scale it. That is the premise every buyer starts with, but it still works less than half the time. Just make sure the check clears when you sell!</P>
<P class=sca><I class=calibre14>Money chases easy.<BR class=calibre9>Entrepreneurs overcome hard.</I></P>
<P class=noindent>Since an investment in a privately held business is not easily liquid, it usually requires a higher yield to attract investment. In recent years we have started seeing higher premiums for many businesses, even at smaller revenue sizes. There is so much cash looking for a place to invest and so few businesses for sale that prices are being driven up across the board.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-104 class=calibre4></A>When public companies are growing and the stock market is making great returns, private company valuations stay in the four to six times net income range. (There are industry outliers, like tech, that require more of a bet placed on the future than reliance on current fundamentals.) Investors tend to flock to the public market instead of driving up private company prices since public companies have ready liquidity if the owners want to get out, whereas private companies take much longer to become liquid. When the stock market is near a bubble high and interest rates are very low for fixed income investing, value multiples start to approach 7 to 10 times net income. Money has to find someplace to go. To make great yields from a private business, you need not only cash but skill, or you have to pay someone who is skilled to use your capital wisely.</P>
<P class=noindent>Table 3.3 examines the same buyout example as shown in table 3.1 but with market value calculations at 5 times, 7.5 times, and 10 times net income. You can see that it takes about five years for the five times net income buyout of the 50% partner. As you start to move up the premium scale, the buyout time gets longer and longer.</P>
<P class=text1a><A id=calibre_link-102 class=calibre4></A><B class=calibre6>Table 3.3</B></P>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Example of 50% buyout</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00012.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent>In case you are thinking about selling to a key executive, the management team, or a family member, table 3.3 shows the 100% sale amortization that ranges from 10-plus years to almost 36 years. As a practical matter, you are not likely to successfully complete a 100% sale from cash flows that lasts longer than 10 years. (The Small Business Administration usually lends for only seven years for this type of debt.) Once the value gets beyond five times net income, a capital injection of outside money will be needed to make this type of sale work, except in the rarest of circumstances.</P>
<DIV class=box>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-70 class=calibre13></A><B class=calibre5>Selling to an Insider</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>A sale to someone internally who works for you is hard to pull off with outside debt. The lender is not sure the business will continue to perform as it has, and the purchaser is not coming to the table with any money, just internal experience. If you want to get more money up front, the purchaser will have to raise some outside capital to supplement the debt used at the time of purchase.</P></DIV>
<P class=noindent>This is an important point for multiple shareholders to understand when crafting buy/sell agreements. The company cannot usually fund a market value buyout from cash flow when the market is paying a premium for businesses. Structuring a buy/sell agreement to have an appraisal for valuation is a trap that often causes an early sale of the whole company, rather than one partner taking over after the other partner leaves. Sometimes there are dueling appraisals, when each partner hires their own appraiser, or the partners might agree to use the same appraiser. Unless the appraiser is directed to use only a historical or forward-looking discounted cash flows approach, the partners end up with an unworkable outcome that usually blows up one to two years into the deal.</P>
<P class=noindent>As a planning philosophy, it is hard to argue that the partner who leaves early, without the total sale of the business, deserves more than the economic value. Any attempt to pay the exiting partner more than their share of the economic value usually leads to a failed payout, and nobody is happy. The remaining partner needs to keep the company healthy while using all available profits to buy out the exiting partner. In most businesses, it does not work to stress the working capital or try to grow out of the payout</P>
<DIV class=box>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-222 class=calibre13></A><B class=calibre5>Case Study: Sale to Employee Stock Ownership Plan</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>I worked with a client who decided they wanted to sell their business to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) instead of selling it outright. The founders had done a good job of building a management team that would take over and run the business. They wanted to sell 100% of the business to the ESOP, and they would take back notes to fund the sale.</P>
<P class=noindent>Even though there are significant tax benefits that would help increase cash flow to justify a slight premium to value, the deal would still have to make sense from a cash flow perspective. The founders selected an independent appraiser to value the business, and the appraised value made them happy since it was based on market sales of similar businesses at a time when crazy speculative premiums were being paid. My task was to deliver the bad news to the founders that the deal would never go through at that price, and either their notes would be in default shortly into the deal or they would be forced to sell the business.</P>
<P class=noindent>The founders were convinced the deal would work even though it required increases in profitability and growth that the company had never seen. Needless to say, two years into the deal there was not enough cash flow to service the notes, and the company was sold to another ESOP company that had idle cash and was willing to pay close to the original price. Even though the outcome would have been worse if a new buyer had not stepped in, it did not play out the way all of the stakeholders had wanted. You cannot get maximum value and sell to someone who does not have the cash or the financing ability to pay full price.</P></DIV>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-161 class=calibre4></A>because there is no money to operate with after closing. The only businesses that grow out of this arrangement are the rare ones that require very little increase in working capital to grow.</P>
<P class=secl><B class=calibre5>Why Would Someone Pay a Premium?</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>When you compare the dollar figures for economic value and market value, you start to rethink that quaint idea of selling to a key employee or a family member for just the cash flow value. This is the biggest reason why family businesses have become rare&#8212;not because of social reasons. The market to buy and sell businesses is much more sophisticated than ever before, and it extends much more effectively into businesses valued at less than $5 million than it did prior to the dot-com era in the 1990s.</P>
<P class=noindent>As I said in the return on invested capital (ROIC) discussion, when the ROIC potential is high, the market finds a way to capitalize on it when there is plenty of cash to risk. To prove my point, let&#8217;s look at the example in table 3.4.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-244 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-325 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Table 3.4</B></H2>
<P class=text><I class=calibre8><SPAN class=blu>Business case to pay 10 times net income for an acquisition</SPAN></I></P>
<P class=imgc><img class=calibre2 alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/simple-numbers-2-9780989645263/images/00040.jpeg"></P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-162 class=calibre4></A>Assume the following:</P>
<UL class=calibre12>
<LI class=calibre11>The company purchase price of 10 times net income includes any capitalization the company needs to meet their working capital stability standards. 
<LI class=calibre11>Every $10 million in revenue growth will require $700,000 of additional capital. 
<LI class=calibre11>There is no change in profitability as the company continues to grow.</LI></UL>
<P class=noindent>At the time of purchase, the ROIC is only 10%, which is not very exciting and is not enticing enough to accept as an outcome. The main reason someone would pay 10 times net income is they think they can grow the business better (and potentially more profitably) than the founder. You start to see why they bought the business when they get to stage 1 because they double the original business and get the ROIC up to 19%. To be fair, in table 3.4 I added more capital for each stage of growth. The time frame between each stage will determine if the additional capital will need to come from an outside source or if it can be funded from profits.</P>
<P class=noindent>At stage 2 you see the real reason why the purchaser bought the company: the ROIC increased to 33%. Keep in mind that ROIC is the year-over-year returns and does not include the terminal value of the company in a sale scenario. In the past, almost all companies that were funded from the outside looked for an exit within a 10-year horizon, but there is starting to be a shift, and owners are looking to hold their companies for the long term. As funds look for ways to give investors a return on their money, it is now making more sense to hold on to a business longer, even beyond the 10-year horizon.</P>
<P class=noindent>Consider the US public stock markets since the 2008 crash. The markets have become quite stale since then. Very few companies <A id=calibre_link-105 class=calibre4></A>have gone public, and quite a few have gone back to private. Recall that in table 2.3, which reflects data from 50 private companies, the company growth rate is 14% to 20%, whereas the overall economy is growing from 2% to 4%. It is no wonder the smart money is trying to figure out new ways to invest in private companies (without going public) instead of just flipping them. I expect the private equity market to keep thriving in the current market conditions. Their task is to bring C-suite talent to all the companies in their portfolio at a far greater value than if each company had that talent on its own. That strategy is also more attractive to the executive in each functional area because they will be in charge of a much larger and more robust business.</P></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-326 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Other Valuation Methods</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and you will hear many different ideas of how to determine the value of a business. Even businesses that are not profitable can be quite valuable in certain circumstances. Here are a few other methods to look at when considering value.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-80 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-327 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Strip Sale</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>This is the most common valuation method for small business transactions when one company buys another company. The buyer needs the company&#8217;s operating activity but does not need its overhead, thus the term &#8220;strip sale&#8221; since they strip out the company&#8217;s activity and bolt it on to their existing business. This is almost always done as an asset sale, with the seller responsible for paying off debts and vendors and clearing any liens on assets that were sold. For a business that is struggling, this is a good opportunity to hit the reset button and go in a different direction, and it often leads to a better valuation than trying to find someone to buy the business as is. As they say, sometimes the parts are worth more than the whole.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-150 class=calibre4></A>A strip sale approach was used when a buyer bought my client&#8217;s business for $2 million while it was losing money. The buyer needed the company&#8217;s highly skilled labor, and it would have cost them at least that much to build a comparable team. Plus the buyer had more projects than my client did, and those projects were worth more, so assigning that work to a ready-made team would make them profitable from the first day.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=calibre_link-262 class=calibre>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<H2 id=calibre_link-328 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Thorn in the Side</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>Sometimes a business is a pain to its competitors, and the competitors want that business to go away because its new mousetrap is better. If they cannot compete with the better mousetrap, they might pay a king&#8217;s ransom to make the business go away. This is not uncommon in disruptive industries when the new kid on the block starts to gain market share and the buyer would have to cannibalize their existing margins to compete. It is better to buy them quick before they get too big. I have seen companies get 10 times their <I class=calibre8>revenue </I>just to go away.</P>
<P class=scl><B class=calibre5>Software as a Service and Recurring Revenue</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Software as a service (SaaS) companies and other companies with a strong recurring revenue model are the darlings of the premium business value marketplace. Despite the glory, beware of the traps. I will cover this in more detail in Chapter 6 when I discuss reinvesting in your business concepts. The common belief is to throw all your profits (and possibly outside capital) at growing this type of business as fast as you can. I agree with the idea of rapid growth, but only if you know what actually works to grow your business.</P>
<P class=noindent>I have clients who continually invest in advancing their software (when is a developer ever done with the software?) and spend considerable sums for marketing. Both are noble activities, but more discipline is needed to spend money where it works, not to spend just because you think that is what you are supposed to do.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-151 class=calibre4></A>When possible, I like the controlled experiment process for both software development and marketing. You spend a small amount to prove your concept before you throw a lot of money at it to see if it sticks. It is not a sin to be profitable and have an SaaS or recurring-revenue business.</P>
<P class=noindent>These types of companies like to talk about the lifetime value of a customer. Although it is a nice argument in theory, the ability to measure this value going forward is a shot in the dark. I have heard some pretty lame arguments by marketing directors who like to use this thinking to justify their budget at a higher and higher customer acquisition cost. As a case in point, Google dynamically increases the price of your key search term as you add content that drives demand for it; in essence, they make you bid against your own success.</P>
<P class=noindent>If you want to build your business on recurring revenue or add recurring revenue to your existing business model, focus on market needs that truly fit that model with long-term customers. Trying to force a traditional business activity into a recurring revenue model just to get a higher multiple for a sale does not work if it makes you less profitable on an ongoing basis.

<H2 id=calibre_link-329 class=calibre3><B class=calibre5>Replacement Return Decision Process</B></H2>
<P class=noindent1>When an offer is pending for you to sell your business, it is very difficult to know if you are getting a good deal. The question is not so much about market value, but rather if you should sell now or wait for another time. If you are ready to sell, try to get multiple competitive offers, conjure up any strategic value idea you can muster, scrub any discretionary expenses from the books, and hope for the best. If your company is in its prime and doing well, look at the replacement return you need to get&#8212;the aftertax proceeds from the sale to replace your pretax profit so you maintain the same net income.</P>
<P class=noindent>Selling a business is emotional. For as much as the money sounds good, you are selling your creation. One of the toughest entrepreneurs I know told me that the first weekend after he sold his business, he cried like a baby and second-guessed himself, even though he got a life-changing amount of money. That really hit me.</P>
<P class=secl><A id=calibre_link-153 class=calibre7></A><B class=calibre5>Replacement Return Case Study</B></P>
<P class=noindent1>Going back to the behavioral economics concept, I needed a way to help my clients frame their thinking for the potentially lifechanging decision to sell their business. An idea came to me when a client called to discuss the potential sale of his business. His capital advisors had brought multiple offers at seven times net income to the table. The advisors (who stood to make $1.5 million in fees at this price) were telling him the offers were a good deal at a premium price, and they advised him to sell. I told him that even though the offers were indeed at a premium, they were still not enough. In a moment of inspiration, I did the math to help him think through the decision.</P>
<P class=noindent>He had a great business in a growing market, and his top-notch management team allowed him to work 15 hours per week in a strategic role, not an operational one. Plus he was drawing a generous market-driven CEO salary that allowed him to live comfortably. If he were to sell the business for seven times net income and pay taxes at the capital gain rate, he would have to get a replacement return of 18% to break even (the company&#8217;s current net income divided by after-tax proceeds from the sale). I explained that instead of selling now, he could keep the business, harvest the profits for a few more years, continue the company&#8217;s current growth rate, then sell the company for more. I said that even though there would be a risk that something in the future could change, a sale at seven times net income was not enough, given that the company was profitable and fully capitalized. I left the decision up to him with a cautionary note that the math said he could do better.</P>
<P class=noindent>He called me back in a week and said he got the offer up to 10 times net income, which brought the replacement return to about 10%. I gave him the green light to proceed with the sale. The change from 7 times to 10 times net income was life-changing money.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-154 class=calibre4></A>Helping this client make such a pivotal decision was one of the most rewarding moments in my career. Although I did not get a percentage of the increase, I learned a far more valuable lesson: the strongest tool to increase the price is the power to say no and not be hurt if the sale falls through.</P></DIV></DIV>

<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-146 class=calibre4></A>Even though the return on invested capital (ROIC) is 67% in each column, you must consider the current value of the company, net of taxes, to calculate the replacement return. Emotional reasons to sell a business include retirement, fear about the future market, or the desire to sell to family or key employees. But from an economic point of view, you would need to get a replacement return between 13% and 27% at the three value points shown in table 4.1.</P>
<P class=noindent>I find that most entrepreneurs are reluctant to invest in the stock market and generally turn to real estate for alternative investments. My real estate clients indicate (and my own data confirms) that the expected yield for a real estate portfolio is between 8% and 15%, not considering unusual spikes in market values for property sales or lack of liquidity in down markets with tighter financing rules.</P>
<P class=noindent>Using replacement return to guide your thinking, if you have a sale offer for five times net income, you should sell only if you have another business idea for reinvesting the after-tax proceeds. Since a good business can yield 50% ROIC or more, reinvestment in another business is the only economic reason to sell at this price.</P>
<P class=noindent>A sale offer for seven times net income is beyond the high end of real estate returns, and you should sell only to reinvest in a better business or for emotional reasons.</P>
<P class=noindent>An economic green light occurs only when the replacement return is anywhere below 15%. You would pass on an offer at this level only if there are still significant growth opportunities for your business. A good time to exit is when you foresee more risk or effort to take advantage of those opportunities, typically when you need to expand your geographic reach and you would be forced to travel and be away from family, which is always a tough trade-off.</P>
<P class=noindent><A id=calibre_link-155 class=calibre4></A>When you start a business or reinvest for growth, use ROIC for decision making. When you consider selling a business, use replacement return to gain economic clarity. Since I developed this concept to help my clients think through keep-versus-sell decisions, it has helped them postpone sales discussions unless they can get a replacement return below 15%. It also helps them see their business more as an investment and lets them focus on enhancing profit and making their capital more efficient; these are the levers of ROIC, as we will see in Chapter 5.
