The distinction between profit and cash flow is a common cause of confusion. The profit and loss account as such is not concerned with cash flow. This is covered by a separate statement. For instance, employees&#8217; pay incurred but not yet paid must be charged as cost even though there has been no cash flow. On the other hand, payments to suppliers for goods received are not costs, simply cash flow. Costs are incurred when goods are consumed, not when they are purchased or paid for. 
<P></P>
<P>Cash spent on the purchase of assets is not a cost, but the corresponding depreciation over the following years is.</P>
<P>A loan repayment is not a cost because an asset (cash) and a liability (loan) are both reduced by the same amount, so there is no loss in value by this transaction.

In recent years, the question of extraordinary items has been much discussed. The issue here is whether large, one-off gains or losses should be included with normal trading activities. We can readily accept for analysis purposes the argument that these should be set to one side and not allowed to distort the normal operating results. This was the approach used in producing accounts for many years. However, in some companies, the rule was used selectively. Items became extraordinary or otherwise in order to present the desired picture. The rule has now been changed to avoid the possibility of distortion.

<P>Finally the question of timing is vital. Having established what the true costs and revenue are, we must locate them in the correct time period. The issue mainly arises just before and just after the cut-off date between accounting periods. As shown in <A title="Figure&nbsp;4.2.&nbsp;The profit and loss account &#8211; timing adjustments" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch04.html#ch04fig02">figure 4.2</A>, we may have to move revenue or costs forwards or backwards to get them into their correct time periods.
