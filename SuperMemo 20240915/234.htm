<blockquote><div class="poem">
<p>Is there a difference between reading something on the internet and then copying/pasting extracts into SM, and actually reading the article in SM and then extracting stuff? 
</p><p>The reason I'm asking is that I can't just copy an entire Kindle book and put it into SM.

There is no difference, as long as the way of learning is different
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Answer_2_by_WojtekTM">Answer 2 by WojtekTM</span></h2>
<p>You can use Calibre to convert .mobi ebook into HTMLZ format. Then you can
unpack content using e.g. 7-Zip. You will get html file with images, that
can be opened in IE and then imported into SM.
</p><p>After reading a few books I am inclined to agree with Piotr Wozniak that
incremental reading is not well suited to read books.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Answer_3">Answer 3</span></h2>
<p>Two factors will determine your decisions:
</p>
<ul><li>your fluency in <a title="Incremental reading" href="https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a></li>
<li>the ratio of value/volume in the text</li></ul>
<p>The more fluent you are, the more you will rely on <a title="Incremental reading" href="https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. On the other hand, if texts are full of prose and only contain few pieces of valuable information, you will better summarize. However, there are texts that are packed with knowledge. Where each sentence is important. Those you would prefer to process with IR.
</p><p><br>
In conclusion, the longer you use SuperMemo the more IR you will use for two reasons:
</p>
<ul><li>fluency</li>
<li>rejecting texts of low value density</li></ul>
<p>If you are new, as indicated by the question, you can still better rely on writing your own summaries and using them in incremental reading.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Answer_4">Answer 4</span></h2>
<p>I'm just a novice to SM but I think the following content might help.
I believe your doubt is genuine; Supermemo is a great tool. However, the greatness lies in "how you use it"
</p><p>After one yr of experience- I can tell you there are multiple ways to use SM. But I see its as a tool for Interleaving, active recall &amp; space repetition to accelerate learning.
The way you use it highly depends upon your need &amp; purpose.
</p><p>Initially, I followed <a title="20 rules" href="https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/20_rules">20 rules</a> of formatting to the core with <a title="Incremental reading" href="https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, which lead to creation of &gt;25000 items covering only 35% of my syllabus (covering many disciplines), later in time it became impossible for me to review them all. So, I abandoned that method. (after 10 months of its use) I revisited my needs, introspected my exam requirements &amp; life long learning needs and came up with this new method.
</p><p><b>New Method</b>= Use of incremental reading (with <a title="Active recall" href="https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Active_recall">active recall</a>, <a title="Spaced repetition" href="https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> &amp; Interleaving), only for important stuff like keywords, key phrases, statements, claims, important stats, conclusion, etc that are really important for you (along with tailored formatting rules)
</p><p><b>Way to use</b>= Use of <a title="Contents window" class="mw-redirect" href="https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Contents_window">Contents window</a> in Supermemo to create a <a title="Hierarchy" class="mw-redirect" href="https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>. Create a <a title="Topic" href="https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Topic">Topic</a> and type-in/copy-paste only the most important stuff wrt exams/other needs, instead of copy-pasting the entire Chapter/lesson/section/book, which is time consuming, &amp; then use cloze test to remember items.
</p><p>This helps to consolidate/summarize the entire topic/book in just couple of paragraphs/topics while keeping its essence intact. Also, it leads to manageable number of items/topics for active recall, while focusing only most important stuff.
</p><p>Also, while reviewing keep items &amp; topics both in queue as helps in providing grass-root view &amp; bird's-eye view of single/multiple concepts &amp; how they link together. (Use mind maps if necessary)
In short-&gt; Consolidate the notes from multiple sources into hierarchical structure, then use incremental reading to read/review/update/upgrade/remember notes in efficient manner.
</p><p><b>Your scenario</b>! I think initially you should test multiple methods and then come up with a method that suits your requirement while keeping the fundamentals in-mind (Incremental reading, active recall, interleaving &amp; <a title="Spaced repetition" href="https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>)
</p><p>Also, I think you should summarize each paragraph-&gt; chapter-&gt; Whole book. This will keep your items/topics manageable and make learning fun &amp; easy.
</p><p>For more help read-&gt; What smart students know by Adam Robinson, Make it stick, Ultra Learning, How to Study By George Fillmore Swain and ofcourse Supermemo Blogs &amp; Manuals
</p><p>I hope it helps

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Answer_5">Answer 5</span></h2>
<p>A lot of great tips in previous answers and here is my experience. I have 20 books or so currently in SM (Kindle books I converted/imported via a Kindle to HTML tool) together with ca 46.500 topics in total in my collection so quite a lot of stuff and I use SM for EVERYTHING i.e everything I need to read, I import into SM no matter what it is and I don&#180;t summarize or anything like that (I do split books up in chapters and then read all chapters in parallell and comprehension USUALLY isn&#180;t a problem except in some cases where some information from a preceding chapter is needed for comprehension. In those cases, I usually manually go back a chapter and try to find the information I need and this approach isn&#180;t ideal but in the long run, I believe this is the fastest and most effective way of reading the book). The only problem I have with massive overload is, slow progress on individual things and regular manual rescheduling of topics like for example the Kindle books. I also import new topics almost daily and have a very large appetite for learning a lot of different things so MASSIVE overload is the norm for me. That does create some issues like me having to regularly go over important concepts and upprioritize and change interval as otherwise, those concepts would be lost in the sea of stuff I have in my collection. I use an internal intuition to guide this process e.g I have various periods of heightened interest / flashes of interest where I focus in on specific concepts e.g currently I might have an interest in a particular concept e.g oeonology/wine-tasting and I have a ebook and also various articles related to that in my collection which I read and try to process as much/best I can until my interest is satiated (might take a couple of weeks or so) and that usually also coincide with the topics of that concept being either downprioritized or the interval quite long i.e I don&#180;t get topics related to the concept on a daily basis any longer (I now instead get all of the items I created during the interest period which I then "process" internally and try to learn, think about, understand better etc. which for me is a longer process). I admit to doing something that goes against SM "rules" a bit I think and that is, going against the priority bias i.e I often have these periods of interest where I take advantage of my "inner drive of interest" and upprioritize stuff related to the concept I have a current interest in (e.g oeonology/wine-tasting might normally be a 10-15% priority concept for me but when I have one of these periods, I upprioritize it to 0-0.1 and change interval to 1 day and then dig in on that concept). I usually have several of these special interest concepts ongoing at any one time. I use a similar approach for books, a book is usually quite long and I might at the first run at reading the various chapters get 5-10% of the book read and then it disappears in the sea of other stuff in my collection and/but I have various items I then internally process related to the book. After a couple of weeks or months, I might decide (either via a flash of interest of just a thought or want in general to again go back to reading that book and then I do the same things as with a specific interest concept described above i.e I open up the book and uppropritize and change interval for the book so I during the coming period of time will focus in on that book once again).
</p><p>Besides the approach above with special concept interest periods, I also use the concept functionality extensively so I might have a concept called "Anthropology" and then when reading some article on something, a "flash" comes up in my head about something related to anthropology and I then open up the concept, use the contents view to get a quick overview and then do a quick scan and possibly subset review of that concept and at the same time create a couple of items related to it and then I go back to my regular daily learning. 
</p><p>Who knows where these flashes or interest and inspiration comes from, I try to take advantage of them whilst at the same time trying to use SM the "right/recommended" way (strict reading after priority etc.) and/but when you have a very large collection and a lot of stuff, you need to find your own approach to handling your learning to make any progress and how one does this is a very individual thing I think that can only be learned by personal experience using SM.

<P>In this article I would like to discuss the optimum strategy that would <B>maximize the inflow of quality knowledge into the learning process at minimum time</B>. It should be noted that long-term memory is still the bottleneck of the learning process. Consequently, your chief cost in learning will be paid to repetitions (i.e. the effort of keeping knowledge in memory). Yet a noticeable proportion of your time is spent on importing knowledge to <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>SuperMemo</FONT></A> and formulating it for optimum recall. Actually, this fraction of your learning effort will often be most painful and inhibitory. Many would-be-users complain that they do not employ SuperMemo because <I>it takes too long to type in the learning material to the program</I>. This article is an attempt to suggest a set of solutions (other than the obvious one: get <A href="http://www.super-memory.com/sml/sml.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>ready-made learning material</FONT></A>)</P>
<P>New <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/read.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>reading options</FONT></A> and a wider application of <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/texts.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>rich text and HTML components</FONT></A> in SuperMemo 99 through 2002 are likely to influence the way in which you acquire new knowledge with SuperMemo. In early versions of <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/soft/sm6.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>SuperMemo for DOS</FONT></A>, all knowledge was represented as questions and answers in limited-length text fields. This required lots of discipline in formulating items and there was no intermediate stage between the outside sources of knowledge, and the knowledge stored in SuperMemo</P>
<P>Today, SuperMemo makes it possible to import entire articles in electronic form, extract most important fragments, gradually process these fragments at speeds that reflect the importance of particular pieces of knowledge</P>
<P>A collection in SuperMemo becomes a conglomerate of pieces of knowledge of various priority, status and degree of processing.&nbsp;Consequently, SuperMemo 99/2002 adds the following new qualities to learning:</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Faster learning:</B> You can quickly introduce rough notes into SuperMemo and later gradually convert them into well-structured knowledge. This is prioritizing via formulation. Less important material may remain unstructured and, as such, less well remembered. You will see how passive notes gradually fade in your memory and how their individual components will need to be reinforced by formulating specific well-structured items. You will make such reinforcement decisions on the one by one basis depending on the importance of the fading material and the degree of recall problems (see examples below) 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI><B>Better understanding: </B>You can gradually build understanding of complex phenomena. You will start from importing a set of unrelated or even chaotic articles describing a studied complex problem. You can then gradually proceed through this material and gradually build the understanding from basic or simple facts towards details or more complex components of knowledge 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI><B>Creative thinking: </B>You can gradually resolve contradictions in a body of knowledge. If you study a new branch of science with a number of contradictory findings and models, you will find SuperMemo quite useful in grappling with contradictions. By introducing the chaos of new research into SuperMemo, you will gradually locate contradictions and strive at building better and more consistent models in your memory. You will build understanding, resolve contradictions and ultimately creatively discover new truths about the learned material. You will quickly lean towards theories that are better supported by research findings. Those supported poorly will be less firm and will often cause recall problems. You can reformulate or delete these. As you process the material, the creative build-up will be gradual and you will intelligently manage the flow of knowledge in your collection<BR></LI></OL>
<P>SuperMemo 2002 encourages you to (1) collect rough notes from various sources, and (2) introduce these notes into the learning process (even before these notes assume the ultimate well-structured shape). Such rough notes will often <B>not </B>comply with the two pivotal principles of SuperMemo:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B><A name="active recall">active recall principle</A></B>: passive presentation of knowledge is ineffective. Instead of reading that <I>Theodore Roosevelt won the Nobel peace prize in 1906 for mediating in the Russo-Japanese war </I>we should be asked <I>Who won the Nobel peace prize in 1906 for mediating in the Russo-Japanese war? </I>or <I>Which year did Theodore Roosevelt win the Nobel peace prize?</I>, etc. 
<LI><B><A name="minimum information principle">minimum information principle</A>: </B>the act of recall in a single repetition should be accompanied by minimum added effort related to reading comments, wordy questions, etc. Each recall, i.e. each repetition, should refer to a single fact or rule: a single basic memory unit</LI></UL>
<P>In this article I would like to stress that the approach in which you store rough notes and text fragments in SuperMemo does not have to contradict the principles of effective learning. Indeed, the new tools provided in SuperMemo 2000 encourage this approach and assist you in efficient knowledge management. SuperMemo 2000 helps you build better understanding of complex material and creatively resolve contradictions in knowledge you learn</P>
<P>Here are some typical ways knowledge enters your SuperMemo collection:</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Articles: </B>If you find an interesting article on the web, CD-ROM encyclopedia, or any other article available in electronic form, you can copy it to the clipboard, and paste it to SuperMemo with <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/edit.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Edit</FONT></A> : Add a new article </B>(<I>Ctrl+Alt+N)</I>. Note that you need to enter the <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/levels.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>professional level</FONT></A> to make this possible (<B>File : <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/levels.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Level</FONT></A> : Professional</B>) 
<LI><B>Items:</B> If you want to add a single important piece of information belonging to a well-defined <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/categs.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>category</FONT></A>, you can select this category in the <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/toolsbar.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>category combo-box</FONT></A>, choose <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/addnew.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Add new</FONT></A></B> and type in the contents of the item. Usually, you will formulate a question and an answer. Occasionally, you will import a file to illustrate your item (e.g. if your category <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/templates.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>template</FONT></A> includes an image component, you can import a <I>jpg </I>or <I>gif</I> file with <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/compmenu.htm#Import_file"><FONT color=#0066cc>Import file</FONT></A></B>). In earlier versions of SuperMemo, adding items was the primary way of expanding your study material 
<LI><B>Notes: </B>If you want to quickly introduce some rough notes taken while watching TV, reading press, during a lecture, board meeting, or meeting with a friend, you can define a separate <I>To Do</I> category that will allow of the fastest possible transfer of rough notes into the learning process (see <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#Creating a To Do category"><FONT color=#0066cc>yellow inset below</FONT></A> to find out how to set up a <I>To Do </I>category). Your <I>To Do </I>category might use a question and answer template based on Rich Text components (RTF format). Using Rich Text will help you process knowledge gradually depending on the priority and availability of time. If you frequently add sounds or images to your items, your <I>To Do </I>template might include a sound component and one or more image components. In SuperMemo 2002, you can add a new note with <B>Edit : Add to category : Note </B>(<I>Alt+N</I>)</LI></OL>

You could then name such a template <I>To Do Occlusion</I> for easy reference (see the inset <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#Occlusion test"><FONT color=#0066cc>Occlusion test </FONT></A></B><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#Occlusion test"><FONT color=#0066cc>below</FONT></A>).

<P>Depending on the way you introduce knowledge to SuperMemo, its further processing will look quite different:</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Articles: </B>If you have pasted an entire article from an electronic text, you will use options such as <B>Remember extract</B>,<B> Task extract</B>, or <B>Queue extract </B>to generated smaller and more manageable pieces of information.

<LI><B>Items: </B>If you have added a well-structured element to its target category, it will most likely need little further processing except for minor corrections, editing, etc. A subset of these elements will naturally be rescheduled, removed from the learning process, dismissed or even deleted; however, the scale of these actions will be incomparably less than in the case of the next category, i.e. rough notes 
<LI><B>Notes:</B> If you have added a rough note to your <I>To Do </I>category, it will require further processing that will include: 
<UL>
<LI>splitting into smaller fragments 
<LI>rewording 
<LI>generating cloze deletions 
<LI>converting to a simple question-and-answer format 
<LI>moving to appropriate categories (and perhaps merging with the category template at the same time)

<P>The gray insert presents a couple of examples of real-life situations, which could result in adding rough notes to your <I>To Do</I> category.

<P>Your notes will probably be added to the pending queue; however, once your pending queue grows long enough, you will want to immediately memorize those notes that are particularly important&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once you memorize your notes, they will come back to you for review in the learning process. Depending on the importance of a given note you will most likely choose one of the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>If the note contains very important material, you will immediately convert the note to a set of well-structured items (<FONT size=3>see <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#Step 2"><FONT color=#0066cc>further examples in gray insets</FONT></A></FONT>) 
<LI>On a less important note, you can postpone the review by choosing a passing grade (as in standard repetitions). Naturally, each time you postpone processing your note, the interval before the next review will grow larger at each repetition. Soon you will notice, that delicate fabric of memory structure that keeps the note in your memory falls apart as a result of passive review (only <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/g.htm#active_recall"><FONT color=#0066cc>active recall</FONT></A></B> can ensure good retention). If you postpone processing the note 4-5 times, the interval might be long enough for you to come to the conclusion that you should either delete the note (you seem not to have time to process it) or process it only partly (e.g. using cloze deletion options on most important keywords) 
<LI>Occasionally, you can manually decide when to schedule the next review by choosing <B>Jump interval </B>(<I>Ctrl+J)</I> 
<LI>You can shift the note back to the pending queue with <I>Ctrl+R. </I>This way, it will be processed only after you pass all the remaining items in the pending queue 
<LI>You can dismiss the note with <I>Ctrl+D</I>. This way you will come back to the note only if you locate it with search (e.g. <I>Ctrl+F</I>) or stumble against it accidentally 
<LI>You can delete the note if you believe it is not important enough or if you think that you are not likely to ever convert it to well-structured items. Keeping notes indefinitely in the learning process is a poor strategy that is likely to pollute your repetitions and reduce your focus (you may find yourself reviewing less relevant old notes that leave little traces in your memory while you could better use this time for retaining quality knowledge)</LI></OL>
<P>Processing notes is not an <I>all or nothing</I> process. If you notice that upon third or fourth review, important components of the note seem to fall apart in your memory, you can, for example, pick a single keyword and use it with <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/compmenu.htm#Reading"><FONT color=#0066cc>Reading</FONT></A> : Remember cloze </B>to memorize one cloze deletion that will effectively restore this particular semantic relationship in your memory.

In a well-managed learning process, all notes and extracts will ultimately be used to generate well-structured items and dismissed (for future reference) or deleted (if no longer needed).

<OL>
<LI><B>Quality flow </B>- flow of knowledge from articles and notes, through extracts to cloze deletions and well-structured items 
<LI><B>Pool flow </B>- flow of knowledge from reading lists and pending notes towards the pool of pending elements and ultimately memorized elements. Occasionally, some elements will move to the dismissed pool for future reference. Processed articles and extracts will often be deleted for the sake of conserving space and avoiding excessively rich searches in your collection 
<LI><B>Category flow </B>- flow of elements from your <I>To Do </I>category to other categories such as: <I>biology, geography, history, economics, private, Internet,</I> etc.&nbsp; 
<LI><B>Time flow</B> - flow of elements in time from shorter to longer intervals. Because of the fact that a large proportion of processing is done at repetitions, flow of knowledge towards longer intervals slows down the three remaining flow pathways&nbsp;</LI></OL><B>Quality flow</B> 
<P>Quality flow proceeds from articles and from rough notes, through stray images and text fragments towards cloze deletions and well-structures items based on <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#active recall"><FONT color=#0066cc>active recall</FONT></A> and <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#minimum information principle"><FONT color=#0066cc>minimum information:<BR></FONT></A></P>
<OL>
<LI><B>articles </B>enter SuperMemo via reading lists. Once you locate interesting texts in electronic form, you can import them via the clipboard using <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/edit.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Edit</FONT></A> : Add a new article</B> (<I>Ctrl+Alt+R</I>). While reading an article you extract its fragments (e.g. with <B>Reading : Remember extract</B>) that later enter the review process. For a detailed discussion of reading lists see: <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/read.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Reading the Internet</FONT></A> 
<LI><B>extracts </B>are best added to your <I>To Do </I>category based on rich text templates. Using rich text makes it easier to process extracts. Further extractions and cloze deletions leave a permanent colored-font mark in the extract so that you do not have to keep wondering which parts of the extract have already been processed. Here are the three typical ways extract enter SuperMemo: 
<OL>
<LI>as extractions from larger articles with <B>Reading : Remember extract </B>or <B>Reading : Queue extract</B> 
<LI>as pasted via clipboard directly from longer electronic articles (e.g. collected on the net, e-mail, CD-ROM encyclopedia, etc.). Reading lists are best suited for meaty articles full of contents that requires meticulous processing. However, you will often read longer articles that will only sparsely contribute to your knowledge. Very often, a whole article will have zero contribution or will contribute a single paragraph. In such cases, importing it to your reading list would be a waste of your time or a waste of space in your collection (reading lists make your collections swell quickly into dozens of megabytes!). For sparse articles, select the paragraph of interest in your web browser, choose <I>Ctrl+C </I>(copy to clipboard), switch to SuperMemo, select <I>To Do </I>category, choose <I>Ctrl+A</I> to add a new note and paste the content of the copied paragraph (e.g. with <I>Shift+Ins</I> or <I>Ctrl+V</I>) 
<LI>as typed in directly from other sources (e.g. press, TV, books, phone talk, etc.). Very often you will need to type a note quickly without much time to consider the appropriate formulation for learning. Using techniques described in this article, you will later convert such notes to well-formulated learning material</LI></OL>
<LI><B>sentences, pictures, sounds, etc. </B>are best added to the <I>To Do</I> category. Once you encounter an important sentence or phrase, you will quickly paste it in to a new item or type it in (in case it was not available electronically). The same happens with pictures that illustrate an important idea. Once you locate a picture on the net, you can save it on your disk, add a new item, use the <I>To Do Picture </I>template on that item, and use <B>Import file</B> to import the picture to this new item (do not paste images via clipboard as this will store them in space-consuming <I>BMP</I> format) 
<LI><B>cloze deletions </B>will most likely be created from extracts and sentences still located in the <I>To Do </I>category. Optimally, <I>To Do</I> category should be rich-text based. This will make it easy to see which parts of a given extract have already been processed with cloze deletions. On the other hand, template in target categories would better be plain-text based. Text components use much less space and have quite a number of other <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/guide.htm#Which_text_components_are_for_you.3F"><FONT color=#0066cc>advantages</FONT></A>&nbsp; 
<LI><B>questions and answers </B>will either be added directly to the target category in the ultimate shape or will be produced from cloze deletion items after careful analysis of the wording and formulation. Well-processed cloze deletions from <I>To Do</I> branch can be moved to the target category by choosing the category in the <B>Category </B>combo box in the <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/elparam.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Element parameters </FONT></A></B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/elparam.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>dialog box</FONT></A> (<I>Ctrl+Shift+P</I>)</LI></OL>

<LI><B>tasks</B> - tasks will usually have a form of articles and article extracts placed on your <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/read.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>reading lists</FONT></A>. Tasks do not take part in repetitions and are scheduled for review in prioritized lists called <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/taskman.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>tasklists</FONT></A>. You pick tasks for reading with <B>Learn : Reading list </B>(<I>Ctrl+F4</I>) and remove them from the list after reading with <B>Dismiss </B>(<I>Ctrl+D)</I>. Fragments of articles may enter other pools of knowledge by means of <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/read.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>reading functions</FONT></A> 
<LI><B>pending elements </B>- rough notes and items that await the entry into the learning process.

<P align=left><FONT size=2>The horizontal axis corresponds with the repetition number and the vertical axis represents intervals (logarithmic scale). Despite popular belief, the semi-log scale does not produce a linear graph here. Clearly the increase in the length of intervals slows down with successive repetitions. Moreover, the graph corresponding with zero lapses (black curve), results from the superposition of items with lower and faster increase in intervals (determined by difficulty). The bell-shaped curve is determined by all contributing items (below repetition number 10) and then only by difficult items or items with low forgetting index for which the increase in the length of intervals is significantly slower (above repetition 10).

<P><B>Flow dynamics</B></P>
<P>The quality flow is unidirectional, i.e. you gradually move from unprocessed articles and rough notes towards quality knowledge that takes part in the learning process. Category flow is also unidirectional: from unprocessed reading branches to well-formulated category branches.</P>
<P>The pool flow is more complex and often multidirectional. New elements usually start off as tasks in the reading lists, rough notes added to the pending queue or important notes added directly to the learning process (memorized pool). Articles and extracts stored in the reading list (task pool) are dismembered into shorter extracts that flow into memorized or pending pool, while articles themselves are tossed into the dismissed pool upon review (usually they are not deleted until children elements formed during reading are completely processed and moved into target categories; the process that may take months). Pending elements gradually move to the memorized pool (usually at the speed determined by the availability of time for learning). Memorized elements may flow back to the pending queue (if they are considered of lower priority) or into the dismissed pool (if they are considered worth future reference but not worth remembering). Some memorized elements will be deleted if they become irrelevant or are considered no longer needed&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT size=3>Here are some typical actions you will take depending on the answer to the above questions:</FONT> 
<OL>
<LI><B><FONT size=3>editing</FONT></B> <FONT size=3>the item. In case of questions and answer, you will use keys such as <I>Q, A</I>, or <I>E</I> to enter a desired text field and edit it. In more complex items you will use <I>Ctrl+T </I>to circle between components, <I>Alt+click</I> to switch a component between editing and dragging modes, or <I>Ctrl+E </I>to enter the editing mode</FONT> 
<LI><B><FONT size=3>forgetting </FONT></B><FONT size=3>the item. If you think the item is too difficult or not important enough, you can postpone learning it. For this purpose, press <I>Ctrl+R</I> to remove it from the learning process. This will put the item at the end of the pending queue (i.e. the queue of elements that await the entry into the learning process)</FONT> 
<LI><B><FONT size=3>rescheduling </FONT></B><FONT size=3>the item. If you know the item well or for some other reason want to manually increase (or decrease) the length of the inter-repetition interval, press <I>Ctrl+J</I> to select the date of the next repetition</FONT> 
<LI><B><FONT size=3>dismissing </FONT></B><FONT size=3>the item. If you are sure you are not likely to need the item in the future, but you would like to keep it in your collection for reference or archival purposes, press <I>Ctrl+D</I>. Dismissed items are removed from the learning process and from the pending queue. If you create a reading list item and process it gradually (e.g. with <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/compmenu.htm#Reading"><FONT color=#0066cc>Reading : Remember extract</FONT></A></B>), you will want to leave it in your collection until all its children are processed (e.g. moved to appropriate categories). SuperMemo will automatically prompt you once the last child of such an item is moved or deleted. You will then be able to choose if you still want to keep the parent item in the collection</FONT> 
<LI><B><FONT size=3>deleting</FONT></B> <FONT size=3>the item. The key <I>Del</I> is very useful in cleaning your collection from garbage that results from your desire to know more than your memory can hold. In editing mode or in spelling items (i.e. at times when <I>Del </I>plays text editing functions), you may need to use <I>Ctrl+Shift+Del</I> instead of <I>Del</I>.

I passionately learn English. Memorizing proper names, dates, numbers and other dry facts sounds like a pretty good way to waste my time. I am not convinced<BR><FONT size=3><B>Answer:</B><BR>The only rational approach to deciding which material should enter your collection is via the cost-benefit analysis. With a dose of practice, this analysis becomes a semi-automatic process, and should painlessly blend with your life. The cost-benefit analysis should serve as the sole platform for deciding what is worth adding to SuperMemo, and what is not (neglecting the fact that your learning may also be a form of enjoyable pastime). The cost-benefit criterion is: <B>if costs of not knowing a piece of knowledge is greater than the cost of repetitions in a given period of time, add this piece of knowledge to SuperMemo </B>(otherwise do not add it)</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT size=3>Cost</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Cost of a single well-structured item in lifetime ranges roughly from 40 seconds to 3 minutes. At any given moment it may be approximated for a 30-year bracket, by multiplying <B>Future repetitions</B> (in <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/eldata.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>element data</FONT></A>) by <B>Avg time</B> (in <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/statistics.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>learning statistics</FONT></A>). In SuperMemo 2000, this value is already displayed for you in <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/eldata.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>element data</FONT></A>.&nbsp; If your item is ill-structured (i.e. difficult to remember), this cost may bloat!!! To eliminate ill-structured items use <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/leech.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>leech analysis</FONT></A></FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT size=3>Benefit</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Each piece of knowledge in your collections should be associated with a tangible benefit. Only <B>you</B> can accurately guess the value. For example, the value of memorizing the opening hours of your gym in a given time might be approximated by multiplying (1) the probability you will choose wrong hours by (2) the time-cost of missing the gym. For example, if you believe that the probability is 25% and the cost of choosing wrong hours is 40 minutes, the cost of knowing the opening hours is around 10 minutes. In such a case, memorizing the opening hours will be cheaper than missing the gym. However, if the probability is sufficiently low or the time loss sufficiently small, you should not add opening hours to SuperMemo. For example, if the probability is 10% and time loss is 3 minutes, you are not likely to recover your learning investment! There are naturally less clear-cut cases in-between. Use your best knowledge to figure out the outcome</FONT>

<P>This article summarizes my 20-year-long effort in developing techniques and technologies that assist human learning. It should help you quickly convert your learning into a rationally controlled and conscious process. I believe, it describes the tools that collectively account for the fastest learning approach in existence. If knowledge is important to you, this article should help you optimize your path towards your goals. Among others, we will discuss two concepts that can have a dramatic effect on learning: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2><I><B>Knowledge and history: </B>Throughout the ages, knowledge was the cornerstone of human progress. From Stone Age to Information Age, in pain, we have built a tiny oasis of civilization in ruthless expanses of the evolving universe. The history of the mankind is made of billions of individual lives that keep on sparking and fading. Born of self-preservation instincts imprinted by evolution, history books paint a picture of a constant string of wars, conflict of interest, loss and gain of influences, lust for power and submission to weaknesses of human nature. On the other hand, the greatest achievement of the evolution, the rational mind, kept on contributing to new findings, discoveries, technologies and philosophies. Progress has always hinged on discovering new truths and preserving them for posterity in form of stories, solutions, tools,&nbsp; books, and other carriers of information. Knowledge is the basis of human power, yet it constantly struggles with two forces that regularly diminish it: death and forgetting.&nbsp;We can preserve knowledge in books and other forms of information storage. However, this knowledge translates to value only then when it is used by the creative power of the human brain. The limitations of the human brain will remain a bottleneck of progress for many years to come. We will develop artificially intelligent knowledge processors not earlier than in a decade or two</I></FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2><I><B>Knowledge and death: </B>Death poses an ageless challenge of educating new generations. Years of hard work needed to gain knowledge on professorial level are obliterated in a single act of death. Newborns need to go through years of education before they are able to access, read, and comprehend this text. They all have to struggle with basic literacy skills, lessons of safe sex and teen pregnancy, lessons on superiority of altruism over egoism, the difference between wise and not-so-wise choices, existential questions, etc. Although constant reeducation may contribute to gaining a fresh perspective in each generation, it is also painfully wasteful. As yet, there is no efficient remedy to the death of knowledge. All we can do is to attach more weight to healthy lifestyle and health research. Those two promote longevity of knowledge in a single generation</I></FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2><I><B>Knowledge and forgetting: </B>Forgetting is a natural process that makes it possible to efficiently use the limited memory space of the brain. We forget to dispose of knowledge deemed less important in order to make space for knowledge of higher importance. Currently we have only a limited control over what we remember and what we forget. Today, the most important tool that we can use to prevent forgetting is practice. We can minimize time needed for practice by using spaced repetition (i.e. learning technique based on computing optimum intervals between repetitions). <B>Spaced repetition is the key to maximizing knowledge within a single human lifetime </B>(see below for more details)</I></FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2><I><B>Immortal knowledge: </B>Artificial intelligence is our best hope for approaching immortal knowledge. It can nearly eliminate the problem of death (except for the heat death of the universe). It can also eliminate the problem of forgetting (at least within the bounds of the available storage). Today, however, the best path towards immortal knowledge must still rely on the use of the human brain by maximizing its learning capacity</I></FONT> </P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P><B><A name="Knowledge acquisition">Knowledge acquisition</A></B> </P>
<P>There are five main areas where the learning process can be enhanced. All these areas will be discussed in this article:</P>
<OL>
<LI><B><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/devour.htm#Access to knowledge"><FONT color=#0066cc>access to knowledge</FONT></A> </B>- this article will make an assumption that the Internet is your main source of knowledge. You can later easily extrapolate the discussed skills to accessing other sources of knowledge 
<LI><B><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/devour.htm#Selecting knowledge"><FONT color=#0066cc>selecting knowledge</FONT></A> </B>- we will assume that you are solely responsible for selecting knowledge you want to learn. Your ability to select valuable information will grow in proportion to the acquired knowledge. This article will show you the tools that can assist you in this process 
<LI><B><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/devour.htm#Reading"><FONT color=#0066cc>reading</FONT></A> </B>- reading is the process in which knowledge for the first time makes an actual intimate contact with your brain. Traditionally, it is streamed into your memory in a more or less linear manner (i.e. paragraph after paragraph). This article will help you delinearize this process and optimize reading by enhancing <B>knowledge selection and prioritization </B>concurrent with reading. For example, you will be able to say <I>This paragraph can be processed later</I> or <I>This paragraph requires utmost attention now</I> or <I>This paragraph can be skipped for good even if I decide to read the article again</I>, or <I>I want to read this paragraph again in three days and in more detail</I> or <I>I want to mark this paragraph with lower-priority and come to it only after all higher priority paragraphs have been processed</I>, etc.&nbsp; 
<LI><B><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/devour.htm#Representing knowledge"><FONT color=#0066cc>representing knowledge</FONT></A> </B>- the way in which you present knowledge will affect comprehension and retention (i.e. how well you remember). Things that are simple are easier to understand. Things that are simple are also easier to remember. Many people do not realize the degree to which simplicity can affect learning. Many people doubt that even the most complex material can be presented in a very simple way. Einstein noticed that "<EM>it should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid"</EM> 
<LI><B><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/devour.htm#Remembering knowledge"><FONT color=#0066cc>remembering knowledge</FONT></A> </B>- this article will tell you how to eliminate the problem of forgetting once and for all. It will encourage you to use the learning technique based on spaced repetition and commercially known as <I>SuperMemo</I> (from <I>Super Memory</I>). SuperMemo produces immense savings in time by scheduling review of the studied material only then when the review is necessary (see: <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Introduction to SuperMemo</FONT></A>) 
<LI><B><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/devour.htm#Life cycle of knowledge"><FONT color=#0066cc>life cycle of knowledge</FONT></A> </B>- this article will show you an approach in which knowledge in your memory keeps on evolving and maturing. This will involve continual rewording, reprioritizing, and re-associating pieces of knowledge. You will often give up portions of knowledge that become outdated or lose their high-priority status. You will apply the rules of knowledge representation that will make knowledge easy to remember. Your knowledge will also become more associative in time. In other words, it will become a more suitable ground for making intelligent choices&nbsp; 
<LI><B><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/devour.htm#Using knowledge"><FONT color=#0066cc>using knowledge</FONT></A> </B>- knowledge translates to value when it is properly used. In the long-run, skills discussed in this article will indirectly help you become more creative and skillful in using your own knowledge. Not surprisingly, your skills needed to efficiently use knowledge are also part of knowledge itself and tend to grow spontaneously as your knowledge increases</LI></OL>

<P>The Internet is an excellent source of knowledge. Its quality and role will for long continue increasing exponentially as more and more people appreciate its potential and contribute to its growth. There are still many complementary sources of information that compete successfully with the Internet. However, it is only a question of time before you will be safely able to rely on the Internet as your sole source of information.&nbsp; </P>
<TABLE width="100%" bgColor=#c0c0c0 border=3>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD width="100%">
<P><FONT size=2>The three main factors that limit the value of the Internet as the source of information today:</FONT> </P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=2><B>verification </B>- there are no formalized peer-review or other verification mechanisms that would make it easy for you to ascertain the reliability of information available and trustworthiness of authors. The burden of proof is on you. You either need to tap onto reputable sites or judge the reliability of individual authors on preponderance of evidence. Consequently, reputable scientific journals are still an unmatched source of raw research data (cf. <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Salinger_Syndrome"><FONT color=#0066cc>Pierre Salinger syndrome</FONT></A>)</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2><B>bandwidth </B>- popular broadband access to the Internet is still to come. This limits availability of quality video documentaries, video reporting, video education, interactive material, etc. Consequently, television and multimedia titles have still a substantial role to play as an educational tool</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2><B>micropayments</B> - authors still see the printed matter as their main source of income. In the future, your credit account may be charged to a microscopic amount each time you access a selected page on the web if the author decides to make it a source of his or her income. This may ultimately cause a massive exodus of authors from the traditional publishing industry towards the net with immense benefit to those mining for quality data on the net</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><FONT size=2>Despite the Internet's limitations, you can safely commit yourself today to making the net your chief source of knowledge in your quest for new knowledge in nearly all areas of well-rounded self-instruction. The abundance of free encyclopedias, journals, dictionaries, databases, stand-alone articles and thematic websites is mind-boggling.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>All you need for the purpose of knowledge access is a web browser and basic net-searching skills combined with an understanding of the power of individual search engines such as <A href="http://www.google.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>www.google.com</FONT></A> </FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Throughout this article, I will try to demonstrate that you will need a tool for efficient prioritizing and reviewing information: <A href="http://www.super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2004.html"><FONT color=#0066cc>SuperMemo 2004 for Windows</FONT></A>. The true power and importance of SuperMemo comes from ensuring high retention of knowledge. SuperMemo 2004 will also help you greatly increase the quality of reading by means of a technique called: <I>incremental reading</I>. In addition to its main strengths, SuperMemo can also assist in the field of knowledge access. You will certainly face the need to fill the gaps in your knowledge in many more areas than your time permits or your memory makes possible. You can ask SuperMemo to help you scrupulously note down and prioritize all areas of knowledge that need an enhancement!&nbsp; </P>
<P><B><A name="Selecting knowledge">Selecting knowledge</A></B> </P>
<P>The extent of global knowledge resources can be measured in terabytes. One terabyte is a thousand gigabytes, while one gigabyte is a rough equivalent of the <I><A href="http://www.britannica.com/"><FONT color=#0066cc>Encyclopaedia Britannica</FONT></A> </I>whose 44 million words would most likely all fit your today's hard disk space. The US Library of Congress is estimated to amount to 25 terabytes of knowledge. Human DNA code kept at Celera takes 80 terabytes. At the same time, the so-called <I><A href="http://www.completeplanet.com/help/help_deepwebFAQs.asp"><FONT color=#0066cc>deep web</FONT></A> </I>(year 2000) may encompass as much as 7,500 terabytes (deep web includes the static web extended by dynamic information retrievable from web databases). It will take only three years from today to produce more data than in the whole of human history (say <A href="http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=444343"><FONT color=#0066cc>researchers at the University of California</FONT></A>). </P>
<P>Only a fraction of those resources can be mastered by an individual in a single human lifetime. Even a single copy of the <I>Encyclopaedia Britannica</I> goes in detail far beyond what a single human being can encompass in a lifetime! The actual speed of learning and lifetime learning limits can be measured with SuperMemo (see: <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/theory.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>Theoretical aspects of SuperMemo</FONT></A>). </P>
<P>The microscopic capacity of the human brain has not prevented it from building the present civilization as we know it. The human power comes from:&nbsp; </P>
<OL>
<LI><B>collective effort</B> - a billion heads is more than one 
<LI><B>specialization of labor </B>- all collective tasks are subject to top-down functional decomposition and a single brain usually only needs to process a fraction of information at a time&nbsp; 
<LI><B>knowledge selection skills </B>- the associative power of the human brain combined with the selective nature of forgetting help us retain memories that are actually most useful in problem solving</LI></OL>
<P>This article will show you how to prevent forgetting. However, forgetting plays an important role in our lives. It runs a valuable garbage collection on knowledge we acquire daily. If the power of forgetting is taken away, your responsibilities in the area of selecting knowledge increase manifold!&nbsp;</P>

<P>A piece of information that occupies just several bytes of your hard disk may carry a relative value that my translate to a net gain of millions of dollars as well as a net loss of millions of dollars. It may also carry no value whatsoever. For example, a sentence written in French "<I>SuperMemo vous aide &#224; m&#233;moriser et apprendre diverses informations comme une langue, des chiffres, etc.</I>" may be of nearly zero value for someone who does not know French. At the same time, an item related to a Heimlich maneuver can save the life of a family member. We know that the expected payoff equals the value of the payoff multiplied by its probability; therefore, the <A href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000047.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>low probability of a family member choking</FONT></A> and the probability of actual successful application of the maneuver make the value of "Heimlich item" a fraction of the value of the human life. At the same time, even minor errors in medical knowledge of a physician can actually cost somebody's life and carry substantial negative value! </P>

<P align=left>Traditional linear reading is highly inefficient. This comes from the fact that various pieces of the text are of various importance. Some should be skipped. Others should be read in the first order of priority. Old-fashioned books are quickly being replaced with hypertext. Hypertext will help you quickly jump to information that is the most important at any given moment. Hypertext requires a different style of writing. After all, all texts will live by the assumption that there has been some introductory section read before. The texts become context-independent, and all difficult terms and concepts are explained solely with additional hyperlinks. As the world wide web helped delinearize the global resources of information, <A href="http://www.super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2004.html"><FONT color=#0066cc>SuperMemo 2004</FONT></A> can help you delinearize your reading of whatever linear material you decide to import to SuperMemo. While reading with SuperMemo, you will see a linear text as a sequence of sections subdivided into paragraphs and individual sentences. SuperMemo will help you provide a separate and independent processing for each section, paragraph or sentence. Here are some typical actions you will execute on individual sections, paragraphs or sentences. Most typically you will decide one of the following: </P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>read and remember </B>- you can read a paragraph and schedule it for a future review. The timing of the review will depend on the paragraph's priority</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>skip to read later&nbsp;</B>- you can mark a paragraph as worth reading later. The moment in which the paragraph will come back for reading will depend on the paragraph's priority.&nbsp;</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>skip for ever </B>- you can mark a paragraph as (1) not worth reading, or as (2) read and not worth remembering&nbsp;</P></LI></UL>
<P align=left>In SuperMemo, all material worth remembering will be scheduled for review in the future. This is necessary to ensure you do not forget what you have learned. At the same time, all material that has not been read but is classified as worth reading will also be scheduled for reading in the future. In SuperMemo, you will constantly face a serial process of reading, review, and repetition that will make sure that your work with the program is challenging, interesting and leaves permanent traces in your memory.</P>

<P align=left>In SuperMemo, all imported articles will evolve. This evolution will ensure maximum comprehension and retention of knowledge. Initially the articles are split into sections and paragraphs. Those sections and paragraphs are later subject to regular review and further evolution. Individual paragraphs get enriched with context clues, reference labels, and converted to individual sentences. Individual sentences convey ideas which you want to remember. These ideas come back for review at increasing intervals. Initially, the ideas come back every couple of days, later after months and years. However, passively processed ideas in the form of sentences rarely leave a durable trace in your memory even if they are reviewed regularly. Very often, as soon as after 2-3 months, you will notice that at review time, you actually do not seem able to recall that you have ever had a given sentence in your collection. You will quickly discover that you need <B>active recall</B> in order to remember. Active recall is a process in which you must answer questions. For example, you may be presented with a picture of Charles Darwin and be asked to recognize his face. In the long run, you need to replace passive review with active recall. Otherwise, your memory of the fact will not be permanently consolidated.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left>The fastest way of converting simple sentences into active recall material is to use a <B>cloze deletion technique</B> (<FONT size=2><I>nb: <B>cloze</B> is the correct spelling; please do not report an orthographic error!</I></FONT>). In the cloze deletion technique, you convert simple declarative sentences like:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><I>WW1 was precipitated by the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist in 1914</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left>into question-answer pairs that can be used in actively stimulating your memory for best recall:</P>

<P align=left><B>Tip! </B>Try to avoid using cloze deletion tools on conglomerate paragraphs. Your cloze deletions should be as simple as possible. Consequently, simplifying the parent paragraph to a simple statement will produce simple clozes that will require little processing. If you use <B>Remember cloze</B> on a longer multi-sentence paragraph, you will have to put extra effort on simplifying the resulting items. All cloze deletions should be short enough to ensure you read them entirely at repetition time. Otherwise, your brain will tend to "deduce" the answer from non-semantic clues.

<P align=left>The active recall issue in representing knowledge is just a tip of the iceberg. You will need to master quite a number of skills that will ensure your knowledge is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P align=left>easy to remember</P>
<LI>
<P align=left>quick to process</P>
<LI>

<P align=left><B><A name="Remembering knowledge">Remembering knowledge</A></B></P>
<P align=left>Forgetting has been the number one problem in learning for ages. All capable students know that it is not really hard to cram hundreds of pages of material before an exam. But a great deal of the learned knowledge is gone just 3-4 days later (esp. after an exhaustive all-nighter). 50% of the quickly crammed knowledge evaporates within a week or two. After a year or so, nearly all material is forgotten unless reviewed. It is easy to notice that the repetition is the key to remembering in the long run. <I>Repetitio mater memoriae </I>may date back to Horace (65-8 BC).</P>
<P align=left>In <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>SuperMemo</FONT></A>, review of the learned material is in the center of the learning method. The review algorithm has started the whole concept of SuperMemo in the <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/history.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>early 1980s</FONT></A> and the first software implementation of <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/soft/sm2.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>SuperMemo in 1987</FONT></A> was based solely on repetitions of simple questions and answers.</P>
<P align=left>SuperMemo makes it possible to remember, by default, 95% of the learned material (see: <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/princip.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>General principles of SuperMemo</FONT></A>). You can program this retention level to fall between 90-99%. You can also determine the retention individually for each of the pieces of information subject to review. You can also use tools that will make it possible to substantially increase the flow of information into SuperMemo at the cost of retention.&nbsp;</P>

<P align=left>Knowledge stored in SuperMemo will gradually be transformed and reformulated. This will also reflect changes to the corresponding knowledge in your memory. Three main principles will underlie the evolution of knowledge in SuperMemo: 
<UL>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>decrease in complexity</B> - articles will be converted into sets of paragraphs. Paragraphs will be dismantled into sets of independent sentences and statements. Sentences will be shortened to maximize the contents-vs-wording ratio, etc.</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>active recall</B> - all pieces of information will ultimately be converted into <B>active recall</B> material such as question-answer pairs, cloze deletions, picture recognition tests, sound recognition tests, etc.</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>incrementalism </B>- all changes will take place gradually in proportion to available time, with respect to your selected material priority, and in line with the gradually increasing strength of memory traces</P></LI></UL>
<P align=left>The core of SuperMemo is review and repetition. Changes to individual pieces of knowledge will take place in steps upon successive reviews. Here are exemplary steps that show a complete evolution of a single article into a finished item based on active recall: 
<OL>
<LI>
<P align=left>Imagine that you find an article on the net, e.g. <I>The criticism of global capitalism</I>, and you decide to read it and remember it for ever</P>
<LI>
<P align=left>You import the article to SuperMemo</P>
<LI>
<P align=left>You read the article (e.g. once it tops your reading list or once its turn comes up in <I>incremental reading</I>)</P>
<LI>
<P align=left>While reading, you extract most important paragraphs. One of these, let us say, refers to <I><A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve"><FONT color=#0066cc>Kuznets hypothesis</FONT></A></I></P>
<LI>
<P align=left>The extracted paragraphs will assume a separate life in SuperMemo and will be scheduled for separate review, i.e. independent of the review of the parent article. The extracted paragraphs in the parent article will be marked as <I>processed</I>. Once all paragraphs in the parent article are processed, you will terminate the review of the parent article and keep on reviewing only its components (e.g. selected paragraphs)</P>
<LI>
<P align=left>Upon the first review, usually after a few days, you read the extracted paragraph again and analyze it as to how it should be processed further. You may decide to postpone it, remove it from the learning process, shorten it or extract the most important sentences that you want to remember</P>
<LI>
<P align=left>If you decide to extract a single statement in reference to <I>Kuznets</I><I> hypothesis</I> it will again be marked as <I>processed</I> in the original extract and will assume a separate review cycle in SuperMemo</P>
<LI>
<P align=left>Upon the first review of the extracted sentence, you make further decisions as to its further life in SuperMemo. Let us say, this is the wording of the Kuznets sentence: <I>Acc to Kuznets hypothesis, growth (from the low income levels associated with predominantly agrarian societies) would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</I></P>
<LI>
<P align=left>In order to capture the essence, you would probably decide to shorten the above sentence to the following form: <I>Acc to Kuznets hypothesis, growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</I></P>
<LI>
<P align=left>At the same time, other parts of the same parent article might establish a memory trace that would say that <I>Kuznets</I><I> hypothesis </I>has been based on relatively weak empirical data. Moreover, recent research clearly indicates that the hypothesis is false (growth actually seems to equally benefit both the poor and the rich). You could then enhance the extract with words <I>controversial</I> or even <I>recently falsified</I>. For example, <I>Recently falsified Kuznets hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</I></P>
<LI>
<P align=left>Upon the next review of the same sentence, you may decide to convert it into a number of cloze deletions. This conversion will be incremental, i.e. you may decide to first create a cloze deletion asking about the name of the controversial hypothesis and only later ask about its actual meaning (the meaning is relatively easier to remember and shall survive longer in your memory without active recall). Your cloze deletion could then look like this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>Question:</B> <I>Recently falsified <B><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>[...](name) </FONT></B>hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality<BR></I><B>Answer: </B><I>Kuznets</I><I>&nbsp;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left>This cloze deletion would again assume a separate life from the original sentence in which the keyword <I>Kuznets</I><I> </I>will again be marked as <I>processed</I>. This is the original Kuznets sentence with one keyword marked as processed: <I>Recently falsified <B><FONT color=#000000><SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(215,174,174)">Kuznets</SPAN></FONT></B> hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</I>&nbsp;</P>
<LI>
<P align=left>The same sentence will generate a few separate cloze deletions that will be processed independently. Upon the first review of the cloze deletion created in the previous point, you may decide to simplify it in accordance with the <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>rules of formulating knowledge in learning</FONT></A>:&nbsp;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>Question:</B> <I>Recently falsified <B><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>[...](name) </FONT></B>hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase in income inequality<BR></I><B>Answer: </B><I>Kuznets</I><I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>
<P align=left>Upon the next review, you can, but you do not have to, convert the cloze deletion into a standard question-answer item:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=left><B>Question: </B><I>What is the name of the hypothesis that falsely claims that income inequality initially increases with growth?</I><BR><B>Answer: </B><I>Kuznets</I><I> hypothesis</I><B>&nbsp;</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>
<P align=left>The above question-answer pair is probably as simple as it can only be. Certainly, it is simple enough to be relatively easy to remember. This item will be repeated in intervals determined by SuperMemo. You can decide how well you want to remember it. By default, it will be remembered with 95% probability of recall and require 5-15 repetitions in lifetime. The establishment of durable memory traces in your memory, completes the life cycle of this particular piece of knowledge. The only thing that remains is the memory-sustaining review in intervals ranging from months to years (as determined by SuperMemo)</P>
<LI>
<P align=left>Once you convert all important keywords from the Kuznets hypothesis into separate cloze deletions, you will remove the parenting paragraph from the review process. You will not longer passively review the original declarative hypothesis. You will continue repeating individual clozes and that will ensure your perfect recall of the hypothesis for as long as you deem necessary</P></LI></OL>

<P align=left><B><A name="Incremental reading">Incremental reading</A></B> 
<P align=left>If you stop reading an article and return to it after a month or so, you may find it hard to understand the text due to the fact that the part read earlier will have already been partly forgotten while it might have built a solid introduction needed for understanding the remaining sections of the article. 
<P align=left>In <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm"><FONT color=#0066cc>SuperMemo</FONT></A>, reading articles in small parts does not pose a problem. The parts read earlier enter the regular review process that ensures continual retention of all pivotal points. Even more, SuperMemo encourages reading in small parts. This makes it possible to read many articles at the same time, and portion the inflow of information into the learning process in proportion to priority and available time. 
<P align=left>The process or reading many articles at the same time in small portions will later be called <B>incremental reading</B>.&nbsp; 
<P align=left>Without SuperMemo, incremental reading would not be possible. This comes from the fact that only SuperMemo can ensure that you do not forget what you have read before. In other words, if you return to the same article in a week or in a few months, you will quickly recover the context and keep on reading as if you have read preceding parts just minutes earlier. 
<P align=left>The advantages of incremental reading are numerous. They all are interdependent. Good retention enables incremental reading. This provides variety which eliminates boredom, enhances attention and affects creative associations. Good prioritization enhances the speed of reading without affecting comprehension, and that in turn, eliminates the stress of fast reading (worry of missing important pieces of information) and the stress of massive reading (worry of losing track of one or more articles).&nbsp; 
<P align=left>Here is the list of the most prominent advantages of incremental reading:&nbsp; 
<OL>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>knowledge structure and comprehension: </B>Building knowledge in your brain is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle. Some pieces cannot be placed in the puzzle before the others. Some pieces capitalize on others. There is no point in memorizing facts about <I>Higgs boson </I>before you learn what a <I>standard model </I>is and that, in turn, should follow the general understanding of <I>particle physics</I> which itself requires some <I>ABC of physics</I>. In incremental reading, if you encounter texts related to <I>Higgs boson</I> you can manually delay it until the time you hope your <I>Physics ABC </I>will provide the ground for understanding. In traditional reading, you would just waste your time on reviewing <I>Higgs boson</I> material. Traditionally, your decision to skip the material would provide no definite way of coming back to material in the future. With incremental reading, you waste no time on reading material you do not understand. At the same time, you can safely skip portions of material and return to them in the future. You become the master of the conscious knowledge building process</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>attention: </B>Human brain has an in-built limit on the attention span. We all get bored with things. This is often true even with interesting articles once they get too long. Millions of people do a daily channel zapping on TV. This absurd activity is driven precisely by the craving for dense action and information variety. A gripping movie goes "<I>too slow</I>" for a typical channel zapper. This is why he or she prefers to watch three movies at the same time (even though the plot of all will suffer). Incremental reading is a perfect remedy to the limited attention span. Once you sense any sign of boredom or distraction, you can jump to the next article with few negative side effects. Unlike in the case of channel zapping though, you won't miss a bit of information. Just the opposite, you will maximize attention per paragraph. Your attention to the same piece of information may depend on your mood, amount of prior reading, today's interest that may depend on the piece of news you heard on the morning radio, etc. With incremental reading, you can fit your best attention to each individual piece of reading</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>speed: </B>Incremental reading will help you dramatically increase the speed of your first reading of a selected text. You can quickly jump from paragraph to paragraph, get the overall picture, mark fragments for later reading, mark fragments for detailed study, etc. You will be relieved of the greatest bottleneck of speed-reading: fear of missing important pieces of information. As soon as you suspect a quickly-reviewed paragraph may carry more importance than meets the eye, you can simply introduce it back into the review process (as opposed to backtracking and reading the paragraph again). Once you process the entire article, you can slowly digest it again from the very beginning in the incremental reading process. Incremental reading provides for speed-reading without detriment to comprehension&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>prioritization: </B>There are always many more articles at hand than you can hope to read. Evaluating articles and prioritizing them is difficult because you cannot do a good evaluation without actually reading a part of the article in question. In incremental reading, you can read the introduction and then decide when to read the rest. If an article is extremely valuable or interesting, you can process it entirely at once. Other articles can slowly scramble through the learning process. Yet others may ultimately be deleted. The prioritization will continue while you are reading the article. If the evaluation of quality or content changes while reading, so will the reading-review schedule. Prioritization tools will ensure that important pieces of information will receive better processing. This is one of the most important things about incremental reading: efficient fishing for pieces of golden knowledge!</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>consolidation:</B> Everything we learn must be reviewed from time to time in order to be remembered. If you read an article in intervals, you already begin the consolidation of memory which may save you lots of time. In traditional reading, you would need to read the whole article, and then to review the article later several times. With earlier releases of SuperMemo, you would need to read the whole article, and then only review the most important parts of the article in SuperMemo at intervals determined by the program. Now you can begin the consolidation-review cycle already during reading! By the time you convert parts of the material into clozes or question-answer items, you will already have it well consolidated. This pre-consolidation will often dramatically reduce the number of repetitions required before your material gets to be reviewed in long intervals of months and years</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>creativity:&nbsp;</B> SuperMemo will throw at you various articles, paragraphs, statements and questions in a most unexpected order. You will be surprised to discover how this affects your creativity and helps you generate unexpected associations of ideas. This will also provide your brain with an entertaining form of mental training that will be highly appreciated in all forms of professions based on intellectual performance. Critics of incremental reading, who have never tried the method, are not convinced this argument is really tenable. You may be skeptical too. There is only one sure way to convince you: give incremental reading a good try! Try incremental reading for a month at times when your brain is in its peak shape. If the processed knowledge belongs to the areas that are critically important to you, so much the better. You may see your brain turn into a creative sparkler!</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>stresslessness: </B>Once you know you can rely on SuperMemo in presenting review material for you, you can eliminate the stress and anxiety related to having too much to study or too much to read. You will probably not manage to read or learn all that you would hope for, but you will at least not lose sleep over planning and scheduling. SuperMemo is a promise of the best use of your potential. With this conviction, you can devote all your energy to comprehension and analysis of the learned material</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>consistency: </B>If your material contains contradictory parts, your brain will alert you to this fact. In classical learning, you would often relearn new facts that would contradict earlier learned facts. Then you would relearn the older version again and this wasteful cycle might repeat more than once. In SuperMemo, the same process can take place; however, there will be two mechanisms that will prevent it. High degree of retention guaranteed by SuperMemo will often make it quite effortless to immediately spot the contradiction: <I>Wait a minute! I have already learned this fact and the answer was different!</I> Unfortunately, even SuperMemo isn't hermetic to contradiction (your retention actually never reaches 100%). The second mechanism will quickly produce the convergence of contradictory facts in time. If you, for example, learn two different answers to <I>What is the size of human population?</I>, say, <I>5.5 billion</I> and <I>6 billion</I>. You will naturally provide a wrong answer to one of these questions. Once you relearn it the new way, you will provide a wrong answer to the other question. Inter-repetition intervals for these two contradictory items will get shorter with each relearning cycle. The timing of repetitions of contradictory items will tend to converge. It is only a question of time when the red alert is raised by your brain. You will quickly resolve the difference and delete one of the items. Similar process will affect hazy or incompletely specified information. Your knowledge will grow in consistency with time</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><B>massive learning:</B> Massive learning is the consequence of all advantages listed earlier. Incremental reading will run a river of knowledge through your memory. The speed of acquiring new information will surprise you. Even though human memory is painfully limited, you shall be able to read thousands of texts pertaining to different fields and quickly swell the size of your knowledge to your and others' benefit</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=3><B>enjoyability</B></FONT><B>: </B>Those who can compare the classic SuperMemo with incremental reading will testify that incremental reading is by far more enjoyable. Monotonous repetitions are here interspersed with reading and analyzing new material</P></LI></OL>
