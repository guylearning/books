Another important resource you&#8217;ll need for your journey through the Badlands is capital reserves. You can&#8217;t get from $1 million to $5 million on borrowed money. How much of a capital reserve do you need to get your company through the Badlands? In other words, what is your capital safety net? It&#8217;s pretty easy to figure out. Calculate how much cash you need to hire the people you need, then estimate how long it will be before your business can pay the new hires and still remain profitable.

What if you don&#8217;t have the capital and you still want to make the journey? In this situation, you might decide to go out and raise capital. Think about getting money from investors, friends, family, venture capitalists, or whomever else you can think of. There&#8217;s always money in the market. Most venture capitalists will tell you that there isn&#8217;t a lack of money but there&#8217;s a lack of good business ideas and good deals. But there&#8217;s always money for good deals.

I&#8217;ve had other clients who took the investment money and never tapped into it. They put it on their balance sheet and kept on going. This money was their true capital safety net, which is a great strategy. These clients were committed to being profitable every step of the way from the very beginning of the business. They also had reserves in case they hit unexpected obstacles. That&#8217;s another key to success.
