<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>W</SPAN>hen a company sells its products to a purchaser, it does so on the basis of either cash up front or payment due thirty days after the purchaser receives the goods. In some businesses the cash isn&#8217;t due for even longer periods. Sales in this state of limbo, where the cash is due, are called receivables. This is <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=84 id=page_84></SPAN>money that is owed the company. Since a certain percentage of purchasers that were sold goods will not pay, an estimated amount for bad debts is deducted from the Receivables, which gives us Net Receivables.</P>
<P class=indent>Receivables less Bad Debts equals Net Receivables.
