<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;6.3.&nbsp;Summary balance sheet and profit and loss account for the US Consolidated Company Inc. 2000</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>We should remember that the return on total assets is pre-tax and return on equity is calculated using an after-tax profit figure.</P>
<P>These are the rates of return that were achieved by high-level US companies in that year. They are obviously all very good performers and are the gold medallists, as it were, of US industry.</P>
<P>This is not to say that, because they are the largest, they are the most profitable. Indeed better results are often produced by smaller businesses. However, to reach their pre-eminent position, these companies have consistently produced good results, they have survived and grown over many years.</P>
<P>Their continued success is justification for using an average of their combined results as a good target for other firms to aim for.</P>
<P>The rates of return derived from these combined accounts are very high indeed. Levels of inflation have a considerable impact on required rates of return, but allowing for the levels of inflation experienced in recent years, a return on equity of 27 percent (after corporation tax) is exceptional. It is likely that these returns will not be maintained over the coming years.<A id=iddle1706 class=indexterm></A></P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;6.5.&nbsp;Return on equity by country and by sector</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>In Chart (a), we see that there is a wide spread between the US and UK on the one hand and the EU and Japan on the other. In the former countries, we see returns in the high 20s; in the latter we see rates just above and below 10 percent.</P>
<P>Some of these variations can be explained by the differences in methods of accounting. For instance, in an environment that has experienced heavy takeover activity, followed by high goodwill write-offs, equity values in the balance sheet no longer give us a true value for shareholders&#8217; investment, and ROE values would be overstated accordingly. It is the author&#8217;s opinion that an ROE of 15 percent is a very satisfactory return.</P>
<P>Across the industrial sectors there is no regular pattern between countries. The low overall return for Japan is consistent across all sectors. The food sector is the worst offender. It yields only 5 percent. It has shown a dramatic decline over the previous four years, indicating perhaps that the strong yen has caused the greatest damage here.</P>
<P>Outstanding at the other end of the scale are the very high returns being delivered by the US food sector. Included in this category are world-famous names such as Kellogg, Campbell&#8217;s Soup, Hershey Foods, etc. These companies with powerful brand identification deliver extraordinary levels of profit.</P>

<P>It is interesting that this is the sector where companies have bought back a considerable amount of their own shares, a fact that suggests that they have difficulty in finding outlets for their enormous cash flow that will not dilute their very high returns.</P></DIV>

<P>When we look at standard values for ROTA and ROE, the effects of leverage are clearly seen. Even though ROTA is a pre-tax measure it consistently comes out 3 percent to 6 percent less than after-tax ROE values. In the US and UK economies we find results of 14 percent to 16 percent. <A title="Figure&nbsp;6.6.&nbsp;Range of values for ROTA of large UK companies in 2000" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch06.html#ch06fig06">Figure 6.6</A> shows that 50 percent of companies clustered within a range of 8.5 percent plus or minus 3 percent.</P>

<P>A company in the western world would currently need to set its sights on attaining a value of 8 percent to 12 percent as a &#8216;return to total assets&#8217; ratio. This is quite a difficult value to achieve and it may have to fall in the coming years.</P></DIV>
