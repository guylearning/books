<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>M</SPAN> ost companies use what is called an Accrual Method of accounting, as opposed to a Cash Method. With the Accrual Method sales are booked when the goods go out the door, even if the buyer takes years to pay for them. With a Cash Method sales are only booked when the cash comes in. Because almost all businesses extend some kind of credit to their buyers, companies have found it more advantageous to use the Accrual Method, which allows them to book the sales on credit as income under accounts receivable on the income statement.</P>
<P class=indent>Since the Accrual Method of accounting allows credit sales to be booked as revenue it has become necessary for companies to keep separate track of the actual cash that flows in and out of the business. To this end, accountants created the cash flow statement.</P>
<P class=indent><SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=148 id=page_148></SPAN>A company can have a lot of cash coming in through the sale of shares or bonds and still not be profitable. (Similarly, a company can be profitable with a lot of sales on credit and not a lot of cash coming in.) The cash flow statement will tell us only if the company is bringing in more cash than it is spending (&#8220;positive cash flow&#8221;) or if it is spending more cash than it is bringing in (&#8220;negative cash flow&#8221;).</P>
<P class=indent>Cash flow statements are like income statements in that they always cover a set period of time. Company accountants generate one every three months and for the fiscal year.</P>
<P class=indent>The cash flow statement breaks down into three sections:</P>
<P class=indent>First, there is cash flow from operating activities: This area starts with net income and then adds back in depreciation and amortization. Though these are real expenses from an accounting point of view, they don&#8217;t eat up any cash, because they represent cash that was eaten up years ago. What we end up with is Total Cash from Operating Activities.</P>

<P class=indent><SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=149 id=page_149></SPAN>Next is cash flow from investing operations: This area includes an entry for all capital expenditures made for that accounting period. Capital expenditures is always a negative number because it&#8217;s an expenditure, which causes a depletion of cash.</P>
<P class=indent>Also included in this category is Total Other Investing Cash Flow Items, which adds up all the cash that gets expended and brought in from the buying and selling of income-producing assets. If more cash is expended than is brought in, it is a negative number. If more cash is brought in than is expended, it is a positive number.</P>

<P class=indent>Finally, there is the section on cash flow from financing activities: This measures the cash that flows in and out of a company because of financing activities. This includes all outflows of cash for the payment of dividends. It also includes the selling and buying of the company&#8217;s stock. When the company <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=150 id=page_150></SPAN>sells shares to finance a new plant, cash flows in to the company. When the company buys back its shares, cash flows out of the company. The same thing happens with bonds: Sell a bond and cash flows in; buy back a bond and cash flows out. All three of these entries are then added together to provide Total Cash from Financing Activities.</P>

<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>C</SPAN> apital expenditures are outlays of cash or the equivalent in assets that are more permanent in nature&#8212;held longer than a year&#8212;such as property, plant, and equipment. They also include expenditures for such intangibles as patents. Basically they are assets that are expensed over a period of time greater <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=153 id=page_153></SPAN>than a year through depreciation or amortization. Capital expenditures are recorded on the cash flow statement under investment operations.</P>
<P class=indent>Buying a new truck for your company is a capital expenditure, the value of the truck will be expensed through depreciation over its life&#8212;let&#8217;s say six years. But the gasoline used in the truck is a current expense, with the full price deducted from income during the current year.</P>
<P class=indent>When it comes to making capital expenditures, not all companies are created equal. Many companies must make huge capital expenditures just to stay in business. If capital expenditures remain high over a number of years, they can start to have deep impact on earnings. Warren has said that this is the reason that he never invested in telephone companies&#8212;the tremendous capital outlays in building out communication networks greatly hamper their long-term economics.</P>
<P class=indent>As a rule, a company with a durable competitive advantage uses a smaller portion of its earnings for capital expenditures for continuing operations than do those without a competitive advantage. Let&#8217;s look at a couple of examples.</P>
<P class=indent>Coca-Cola, a long-time Warren favorite, over the last ten years earned a total $20.21 per share while only using $4.01 per share, or 19% of its total earnings, for capital expenditures for the same time period. Moody&#8217;s, a company Warren has identified as having a durable competitive advantage, earned $14.24 a share over the last ten years while using a <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=154 id=page_154></SPAN>minuscule $0.84 a share, or 5% of its total earnings, for capital expenditures.</P>
<P class=indent>Compare Coke and Moody&#8217;s with GM, which over the last ten years earned a total $31.64 a share after subtracting losses, while burning through a whopping $140.42 a share in capital expenditures. Or tiremaker Goodyear, which over the last ten years earned a total of $3.67 a share after subtracting losses and had total capital expenditures of $34.88 a share.</P>
<P class=indent>If GM used 444% more for capital expenditures than it earned, and Goodyear used 950%, where did all that extra money come from? It came from bank loans and from selling tons of new debt to the public. Such actions add more debt to these companies&#8217; balance sheets, which increases the amount of money they spend on interest payments, which is never a good thing.</P>
<P class=indent>Both Coke and Moody&#8217;s, however, have enough excess income to have stock buyback programs that reduce the number of shares outstanding, while at the same time either reducing long-term debt or keeping it low. Both actions are big positives to Warren, and both helped him identify Coca-Cola and Moody&#8217;s as businesses with a durable competitive advantage working in their favor.</P>
<P class=indent>When we look at capital expenditures in relation to net earnings we simply add up a company&#8217;s total capital expenditures for a ten-year period and compare the figure with the company&#8217;s total net earnings for the same ten-year period. The <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=155 id=page_155></SPAN>reason we look at a ten-year period is that it gives us a really good long-term perspective as to what is going on with the business.</P>
<P class=indent>Historically, durable competitive advantage companies used a far smaller percentage of their net income for capital expenditures. For instance, Wrigley annually uses approximately 49% of its net earnings for capital expenditures. Altria uses approximately 20%; Procter &amp; Gamble, 28%; Pepsico, 36%; American Express, 23%; Coca-Cola, 19%; and Moody&#8217;s, 5%.</P>
<P class=indent>Warren has discovered that if a company is historically using 50% or less of its annual net earnings for capital expenditures, it is a good place to look for a durable competitive advantage. If it is consistently using less than 25% of its net earnings for capital expenditures, that scenario occurs more than likely because the company has a durable competitive advantage working in its favor.</P>
<P class=indent>And having a durable competitive advantage working in our favor is what it is all about.</P></SECTION>

<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>I</SPAN> n the above cash flow statement the company being examined paid out dividends of $3.149 million, bought back $219 million of its shares, and sold $4.341 million of new debt. All <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=157 id=page_157></SPAN>of this gave the company a net addition of $973 million in cash from financing activities.</P>
<P class=indent>Companies that have durable competitive advantage working in their favor make a ton of money, which creates the lovely problem of having to do something with it. If they don&#8217;t just want to sit on it, or they can&#8217;t reinvest it in the existing business or find a new business to invest in, they can either pay it out as dividends to their shareholders or use it to buy back shares. Since shareholders have to pay income tax on the dividends, Warren has never been too fond of using dividends to increase shareholders&#8217; wealth. This doesn&#8217;t make anyone happy. A neater trick that Warren loves is to use some of the excess money that the company is throwing off to buy back the company&#8217;s shares. This reduces the number of outstanding shares&#8212;which increases the remaining shareholders&#8217; interest in the company&#8212;and increases the per-share earnings of the company, which eventually makes the stock price go up.</P>
<P class=indent>Let&#8217;s look at an example: If the company earned $10 million and has one million shares outstanding, it would have earnings of $10 a share. If we increase the number of shares outstanding to two million, the per-share earnings will drop to $5 a share. Likewise, if we decrease the number of shares outstanding to 500,000, we will increase the per-share earnings to $20 a share. More shares outstanding means lower per-share earnings, and lower shares outstanding means higher per-share earnings. Thus if the company buys back its own shares <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=158 id=page_158></SPAN>it can increase its per-share earnings figure even though actual net earnings don&#8217;t increase. The best part is that there is an increase in the shareholders&#8217; wealth that they don&#8217;t have to pay taxes on until they sell their stock. Think of it as the gift that keeps on giving.</P>
<P class=indent>Warren is such a big fan of this bit of financial engineering that he pushes the board of directors of all the excellent companies he invests in to buy back shares instead of increasing the dividend. He used it with GEICO, and he still is using it with The Washington Post Company.</P>
<P class=indent>To find out if a company is buying back its shares, go to the cash flow statement and look under Cash from Investing Activities. There you will find a heading titled &#8220;Issuance (Retirement) of Stock, Net.&#8221; This entry nets out the selling and buying back of the company&#8217;s shares. If the company is buying back its shares year after year, it is a good bet that it is a durable competitive advantage that is generating all the extra cash that allows it to do so.</P>
<P class=indent>In other words, one of the indicators of the presence of a durable competitive advantage is a &#8220;history&#8221; of the company repurchasing or retiring its shares.</P></SECTION>

<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>I</SPAN> n the late 1980s, Warren gave a talk at Columbia University about how companies with a durable competitive advantage show such great strength and predictability in earnings growth that growth turns their shares into a kind of equity bond, with an ever-increasing coupon or interest payment. The &#8220;bond&#8221; is the company&#8217;s shares/equity, and the &#8220;coupon/interest payment&#8221; is the company&#8217;s pretax earnings. Not the dividends that the company pays out, but the actual pretax earnings of the business.</P>
<P class=indent>This is how Warren buys an entire business: He looks at its pretax earnings and asks if the purchase is a good deal relative to the economic strength of the company&#8217;s underlying economics and the price being asked for the business. He uses the same reasoning when he is buying a partial interest in a company via the stock market.</P>
<P class=indent><SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=162 id=page_162></SPAN>What attracts Warren to the conceptual conversion of a company&#8217;s shares into equity/bonds is that the durable competitive advantage of the business creates underlying economics that are so strong they cause a continuing increase in the company&#8217;s earnings. With this increase in earnings comes an eventual increase in the price of the company&#8217;s shares as the stock market acknowledges the increase in the underlying value of the company.</P>
<P class=indent>Thus, at the risk of being repetitive, to Warren the shares of a company with a durable competitive advantage are the equivalent of equity/bonds, and the company&#8217;s pretax earnings are the equivalent of a normal bond&#8217;s coupon or interest payment. But instead of the bond&#8217;s coupon or interest rate being fixed, it keeps increasing year after year, which naturally increases the equity/bond&#8217;s value year after year.</P>
<P class=indent>This is what happens when Warren buys into a company with a durable competitive advantage. The per-share earnings continue to rise over time&#8212;either through increased business, expansion of operations, the purchase of new businesses, or the repurchase of shares with money that accumulates in the company&#8217;s coffers. With the rise in earnings comes a corresponding increase in the return that Warren is getting on his original investment in the equity bond.</P>
<P class=indent>Let&#8217;s look at an example to see how his theory works.</P>
<P class=indent>In the late 1980s, Warren started buying shares in Coca-Cola for an average price of $6.50 a share against pretax earnings of $.70 a share, which equates to after-tax earnings of <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=163 id=page_163></SPAN>$.46 a share. Historically, Coca-Cola&#8217;s earnings had been growing at an annual rate of around 15%. Seeing this, Warren could argue that he just bought a Coca-Cola equity bond that is paying an initial pretax interest rate of 10.7% on his $6.50 investment. He could also argue that that yield would increase over time at a projected annual rate of 15%.</P>
<P class=indent>Understand that, unlike the Graham-based value investors, Warren is not saying that Coca-Cola is worth $60 and is trading at $40 a share; therefore it is &#8220;undervalued.&#8221; What he is saying is that at $6.50 a share, he was being offered a relatively risk-free initial pretax rate of return of 10.7%, which he expected to increase over the next twenty years at an annual rate of approximately 15%. Then he asked himself if that was an attractive investment given the rate of risk and return on other investments.</P>
<P class=indent>To the Graham-based value investors, a pretax 10.7% rate of return growing at 15% a year would not be interesting since they are only interested in the stock&#8217;s market price and, regardless of what happens to the business, have no intention of holding the investment for more than a couple of years. But to Warren, who plans on owning the equity bond for twenty or more years, it is his dream investment.</P>
<P class=indent>Why is it his dream investment? Because with each year that passes, his return on his initial investment actually increases, and in the later years the numbers really start to pyramid. Consider this: Warren&#8217;s initial investment in The Washington Post Company cost him $6.36 a share. Thirty-four <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=164 id=page_164></SPAN>years later, in 2007, the media company is earning a pretax $54 a share, which equates to an after-tax return of $34 a share. This gives Warren&#8217;s Washington Post equity bonds a current pretax yield of 849%, which equates to an after-tax yield of 534%. (And you were wondering how Warren got so rich!)</P>
<P class=indent>So how did Warren do with his Coca-Cola equity bonds?</P>
<P class=indent>By 2007 Coca-Cola&#8217;s pretax earnings had grown at an annual rate of approximately 9.35% to $3.96 a share, which equates to an after-tax $2.57 a share. This means that Warren can argue that his Coke equity bonds are now paying him a pretax return of $3.96 a share on his original investment of $6.50 a share, which equates to a current pretax yield of 60% and a current after-tax yield of 40%.</P>
<P class=indent>The stock market, seeing this return, over time, will eventually revalue Warren&#8217;s equity bonds to reflect this increase in value.</P>
<P class=indent>Consider this: With long-term corporate interest rates at approximately 6.5% in 2007, Warren&#8217;s Washington Post equity bonds/shares, with a pretax $54 earnings/interest payment, were worth approximately $830 per equity bond/share that year ($54 &#247; .065 = $830). During 2007, Warren&#8217;s Washington Post equity bonds/shares traded in a range of between $726 and $885 a share, which is right about in line with the equity bond&#8217;s capitalized value of $830 a share.</P>
<P class=indent>We can witness the same stock market revaluing phenomenon with Warren&#8217;s Coca-Cola equity bonds. In 2007 they <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=165 id=page_165></SPAN>earned a pretax $3.96 per equity bond/share, which equates to an after-tax $2.57 per equity bond/share. Capitalized at the corporate interest rate of 6.5%, Coke&#8217;s pretax earnings of $3.96 are worth approximately $60 per equity bond/share ($3.96 &#247; .065 = $60). During 2007, the stock market valued Coca-Cola between $45 and $64 a share.</P>
<P class=indent>One of the reasons that the stock market eventually tracks the increase in these companies&#8217; underlying values is that their earnings are so consistent, they are an open invitation to a leveraged buyout. If a company carries little debt and has a strong earnings history, and its stock price falls low enough, another company will come in and buy it, financing the purchase with the acquired company&#8217;s earnings. Thus when interest rates drop, the company&#8217;s earnings are worth more, because they will support more debt, which makes the company&#8217;s shares worth more. And when interest rates rise, the earnings are worth less, because they will support less debt. This makes the company&#8217;s stock worth less.</P>
<P class=indent>What Warren has learned is that if he buys a company with a durable competitive advantage, the stock market, over time, will price the company&#8217;s equity bonds/shares at a level that reflects the value of its earnings relative to the yield on long-term corporate bonds. Yes, some days the stock market is pessimistic and on others is full of wild optimism, but in the end it is long-term interest rates that determine the economic reality of what long-term investments are worth.</P></SECTION>

<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>T</SPAN> o belabor the point, because it is definitely worth belaboring, let&#8217;s look at a couple of Warren&#8217;s other favorite durable competitive advantage companies to see if the yields on their equity bonds/shares have increased over time:</P>
<P class=indent>In 1998 Moody&#8217;s&#8217; reported after-tax earnings of $.41 per share. By 2007 Moody&#8217;s after-tax earnings had grown to $2.58 a share. Warren paid $10.38 a share for his Moody&#8217;s equity bonds, and today they are earning an after-tax yield of 24%, which equates to a pretax yield of 38%.</P>
<P class=indent>In 1998 American Express had after-tax earnings of $1.54 a share. By 2008 its after-tax earnings had increased to $3.39 a share. Warren paid $8.48 a share for his American Express equity bonds, which means they are currently yielding an after-tax 40% rate of return, which equates to a 61% pretax rate of return.</P>
<P class=indent><SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=167 id=page_167></SPAN>Long-time Warren favorite Procter &amp; Gamble earned an after-tax $1.28 a share in 1998. By 2007 it had after-tax earnings of $3.31 a share. Warren paid $10.15 a share for his Procter &amp; Gamble equity bonds, which are now yielding an after-tax 32%, which equates to a pretax return of 49%.</P>
<P class=indent>With See&#8217;s Candy Warren bought the whole company for $25 million back in 1972. In 2007 it had pretax earnings of $82 million, which means his See&#8217;s equity bonds are now producing an annual pretax yield of 328% on his original investment.</P>
<P class=indent>With all these companies, their durable competitive advantage caused their earnings to increase year after year, which, in turn, increased the underlying value of the business. Yes, the stock market may take its own sweet time acknowledging this increase, but it will eventually happen, and Warren has banked on that &#8220;happening&#8221; many, many times.</P></SECTION>

<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>A</SPAN> s stated earlier, in 1987 Warren started buying shares in Coca-Cola for an average price of $6.50 a share against pretax earnings of $.70 a share; this equates to after-tax earnings of $.46 a share. Historically, Coca-Cola&#8217;s earnings had been growing at an annual rate of around 10%.</P>
<P class=indent>Seeing this, Warren could argue that he had just bought a Coca-Cola equity bond paying an initial pretax interest rate of 10.7% on his $6.50 investment. He could also argue that that pretax yield would increase over time at a projected annual rate of 10% (Coca-Cola&#8217;s average annual rate of earnings growth for the ten years prior to 1987).</P>
<P class=indent>If, in 1987, he had projected out the earnings growth of 10% forward, he could have argued that by 2007 Coca-Cola would have pretax per-share earnings of $4.35 and after-tax earnings of $2.82 a share. This would mean that by 2007 his <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=169 id=page_169></SPAN>pretax return on his Coca-Cola equity bonds would grow to 66%, which equates to an after-tax return of 43%.</P>
<P class=indent>So what was a pretax 66% return on a $6.50 equity bond in 2007 worth in 1987? It depends on the discount rate that we use. If we use 7%, which is right about what long-term rates were back then, we get a discounted back value of approximately 17%. Multiply 17% by the $6.50 a share he was paying for and we would get $1.10 a share. Multiply $1.10 by Coca-Cola&#8217;s 1987 P/E of 14 and we get $15.40 per share. Thus Warren could have argued in 1987 that he was buying an equity bond for $6.50 a share, and that if he held it for twenty years, its 1987 intrinsic value really would be $15.40 a share.</P>
<P class=indent>By 2007 Coca-Cola&#8217;s pretax earnings had grown at an annual rate of 9.35% to $3.96 a share, which equates to an after-tax $2.57 a share. This means that Warren can argue that his Coca-Cola equity bonds are now paying him a pretax return of $3.96 a share on his original investment of $6.50 a share, which equates to a current pretax yield of 60% and an after-tax yield of 40%.</P>
<P class=indent>The stock market in 2007 valued Warren&#8217;s equity bonds at between $45 and $64 a share. In 2007 Coca-Cola earned a pretax $3.96 per equity bond/share, which equated to an after-tax $2.57 per equity bond/share. Capitalized at the 2007 corporate interest rate of 6.5%, Coca-Cola&#8217;s pretax earnings of $3.96 a share are worth approximately $60 per equity <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=170 id=page_170></SPAN>bond/share ($3.96 &#247; .065 = $60). This is in line with the 2007 stock market value at between $45 and $64 a share.</P>
<P class=indent>With the market valuing Warren&#8217;s Coca-Cola equity bonds at $64 a share in 2007, Warren could calculate that he has been earning a tax-deferred annual compounding rate of return of 12.11% on his original investment. Think of it as a bond that paid an annual rate of return of 12.11% without tax on the interest earned. Not only that: You got to reinvest all those interest payments in more bonds that were paying 12.11%. Yes, someday you will have to pay taxes when you sell your equity bonds, but if you don&#8217;t sell them you just keep on earning 12.11% free of taxes year after year after year.&#8230;</P>
<P class=indent>Don&#8217;t believe it? Consider this: Warren has approximately $64 billion in capital gains on his Berkshire stock and has yet to pay a penny in taxes on it. The greatest accumulation of private wealth in the history of the world and not a penny paid to the taxman.</P>

<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>I</SPAN> n Warren&#8217;s world the price you pay directly affects the return on your investment. Since he is looking at a company with a durable competitive advantage as being a kind of equity bond, the higher the price he pays, the lower his initial rate of return and the lower the rate of return on the company&#8217;s earnings in ten years. Let&#8217;s look at an example: In the late 1980s, Warren started buying Coca-Cola for an average price of $6.50 a share against earnings of a $.46 a share, which in Warren&#8217;s world equates to an initial rate of return of 7%. By 2007 Coca-Cola was earning $2.57 a share. This means that Warren can argue that his Coca-Cola equity bond was now paying him $2.57 a share on his original investment of $6.50, which equates to a return of 39.9%. But if he had paid $21 a share for his Coca-Cola stock back in the late 1980s, his initial rate of return would have been 2.2%. By 2007 this would have grown only to <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=172 id=page_172></SPAN>12% ($2.57 &#247; $21 = 12%), which is definitely not as attractive a number as 39.9%.</P>
<P class=indent>Thus the lower the price you pay for a company with a durable competitive advantage, the better you are going to do over the long-term, and Warren is all about the long-term. However, these companies seldom, if ever, sell at a bargain price from an old-school Grahamian perspective. This is why investment managers who follow the value doctrine that Graham preached never own super businesses, because to them these businesses are too expensive.</P>
<P class=indent>So when do you buy in to them? In bear markets for starters. Though they might still seem high priced compared with other &#8220;bear market bargains,&#8221; in the long run they are actually the better deal. And occasionally even a company with a durable competitive advantage can screw up and do something stupid, which will send its stock price downward over the short-term. Think New Coke. Warren has said that a wonderful buying opportunity can present itself when a great business confronts a one-time solvable problem. The key here is that the problem is solvable.</P>
<P class=indent>When do you want to stay away from these super businesses? At the height of bull markets, when these super businesses trade at historically high price-to-earnings ratios. Even a company that benefits from having a durable competitive advantage can&#8217;t unmoor itself from producing mediocre results for investors if they pay too steep a price for admission.</P></SECTION>

<P class=noindent><SPAN class=stickup>I</SPAN> n Warren&#8217;s world you would never sell one of these wonderful businesses as long as it maintained its durable competitive advantage. The simple reason is that the longer you hold on to them, the better you do. Also, if at any time you sold one these great investments, you would be inviting the taxman to the party. Inviting the taxman to your party too many times makes it very hard to get superrich. Consider this: Warren&#8217;s company has about $36 billion in capital gains from his investments in companies that have durable competitive advantages. This is wealth he hasn&#8217;t yet paid a dime of tax on, and if he has it his way, he never will.</P>
<P class=indent>Still, there are times that it is advantageous to sell one of these wonderful businesses. The first is when you need money to make an investment in an even better company at a better price, which occasionally happens.</P>
<P class=indent>The second is when the company looks like it is going to <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=174 id=page_174></SPAN>lose its durable competitive advantage. This happens periodically, as with newspapers and television stations. Both of them used to be fantastic businesses. But the Internet came along and suddenly the durability of their competitive advantage was called into question. A questionable competitive advantage is not where you want to keep your money long-term.</P>
<P class=indent>The third is during bull markets when the stock market, in an insane buying frenzy, sends the prices on these fantastic businesses through the ceiling. In these cases, the current selling price of the company&#8217;s stock far exceeds the long-term economic realities of the business. And the long-term economic realities of a business are like gravity when stock prices climb up into the outer limits. Eventually they will pull the stock price back down to earth. If they climb too high, the economics of selling and putting the proceeds into another investment may outweigh the benefits afforded by continued ownership of the business. Think of it this way: If we can project that the business we own will earn $10 million over the next twenty years, and someone today offers us $5 million for the entire company, do we take it? If we can only invest the $5 million at a 2% annual compounding rate of return, probably not, since the $5 million invested today at a 2% compounding annual rate of return would be worth only $7.4 million by year twenty. Not a great deal for us. But if we could get an annual compounding rate of return of 8%, our $5 million would have grown to $23 <SPAN role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=175 id=page_175></SPAN>million by year twenty. Suddenly, selling out looks like a real sweet deal.</P>
<P class=indent>A simple rule is that when we see P/E ratios of 40 or more on these super companies, and it does occasionally happen, it just might be time to sell. But if we do sell into a raging bull market, then we shouldn&#8217;t go out and buy something else trading at 40 times earnings. Instead, we should take a break, put our money into U.S. Treasuries and wait for the next bear market. Because there is always another bear market right around the corner, just waiting to give us the golden opportunity to buy into one or more of these amazing durable competitive advantage businesses that will, over the long-term, make us super superrich.</P>
<P class=indent>Just like Warren Buffett.</P></SECTION>
