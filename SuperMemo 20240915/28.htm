<P>When we talk about the value of a company we mean its market capitalization or the combined value of the common stock. We have already looked at the position that common shares occupy in the balance sheet and have seen where they stand in the queue for participation in profits. Both these issues are important for an understanding of this chapter.</P></DIV>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;12.1.&nbsp;Company valuation applied to data from the Example Co. plc</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>A more pragmatic approach to determine the value of owners&#8217; funds is to take the total assets figure of $800 and deduct from it the total loans figure of $440 (200 + 240). This approach gives us the same answer in our example but it emphasizes the importance of the asset values in determining shareholders&#8217; funds. The authentic value for owners&#8217; funds is derived simply by taking the total value of all assets in todays&#8217; terms and deducting all third party liabilities.</P>
<P>Some adjustments to assets values (and, possibly, liabilities) will probably be necessary.</P>

<P>The nominal value is largely a notional low figure arbitrarily placed on a company&#8217;s stock. It serves to determine the value of &#8216;issued common stock&#8217;, i.e., in the Example Co. the number of issued shares is 32m. The par value is $2.5 to give a value of $80m. If new shares are issued, they will hold this same nominal value even though the issue price will be much above it, probably close to the current market price. Say new shares go out at a price of $17.50, there is a surplus of $15.00 over the nominal value. This surplus is called the &#8216;share premium&#8217; and it forms part of the capital reserves. Many companies have shares of &#8216;no par value&#8217;. They simply put it in the books at the price they were sold at.</P></DIV></DIV>

<P>This value is arrived at by dividing the number of issued shares &#8211; 32m &#8211; into the owners&#8217; funds of $360m. The book value of all the shares is $360m. Therefore each share has a book value of $11.25. You will recall that we discussed the need to validate that sum of $360m. For instance, if an examination of the inventories produced a more prudent valuation of $20m less than the balance sheet value ($108m), this write-down would reduce the common funds from 360m to 340m. The book value would fall from $11.25 to $10.62 per share.<A id=iddle1109 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1544 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1820 class=indexterm></A></P>

<H2 class=title><A id=ch12lev2sec4></A>Earnings per share (EPS)</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>&#8216;Earnings per share&#8217; is one of the most widely quoted statistics when there is a discussion of a company&#8217;s performance or share value.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Earnings per share (EPS)" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>

Remember that the common shareholder comes last in the queue for participating in profit. The profit used in the calculation is the figure after all other claimants have been satisfied. The most common prior charges in the profit and loss account are interest and tax.</P>
<DIV class=figure-float style="FLOAT: left">
<DIV class=figure><A id=ch12fig03></A>
<DIV class=figure-contents>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Earnings per share for the Example Co. plc" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/c12nf003.gif" width=500></DIV></DIV>
<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;12.3.&nbsp;Earnings per share for the Example Co. plc</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>Therefore it is the earnings after tax (EAT) figure that is divided by the number of common shares to calculate the value of earnings per share. This figure tells us what profit has been earned by the common shareholder for every share held.</P>
<P>It serves no purpose to compare the earnings per share in one company with that in another because a company can elect to have a large number of shares of low denomination or a smaller number of a higher denomination. A company can also decide to increase or reduce the number of shares on issue. This decision will automatically alter the earnings per share. We cannot say, therefore, that a company with an earnings per share value of 50&#162; is any better than one with a value of 40&#162;.</P>
<P>While the absolute amount of earnings per share tells nothing about a company&#8217;s performance, the growth in EPS over time is a very important statistic. Indeed, many chairpersons stress it as a prime target in annual reports. Furthermore, growth in earnings per share has a significant influence on the market price of the share.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Earnings per share for the Example Co. plc" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>

Growth in profits can result from a great many things. For instance, a company could acquire another for shares and thereby increase its profit. However, if the percentage increase in profit is less than the percentage increase in the number of shares, earnings per share will fall even with higher profits.</P>
<P>Not only is growth in EPS most important, so also is its stability. Investors look closely at the quality of earnings. They dislike the erratic performance of companies with widely fluctuating profits. A high-quality rating is given to earnings that are showing steady, non-volatile growth.</P></DIV>

Only a fraction of the earnings accruing to the shareholders is paid out to them in cash. The remainder is retained to consolidate and expand the business.</P>

<DIV class=figure><A id=ch12fig04></A>
<DIV class=figure-contents>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Dividends per share for the Example Co. plc" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/c12nf004.gif" width=500></DIV></DIV>
<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;12.4.&nbsp;Dividends per share for the Example Co. plc</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>It is a well-established rule that dividends are paid only out of profits, not from any other source. However, the earnings need not necessarily fall into the same year as the dividends. Therefore situations can arise when dividends exceed earnings. In such cases, dividends are being paid from earnings that have been retained in the business from previous years.</P>
<P>The total return to the shareholder over any given time consists of the dividend received plus the growth in the share price. While for some investors growth is most important, many shareholders and potential investors &#8211; both private individuals and institutions such as pension funds who need income for their day-to-day affairs &#8211; pay very close attention to dividends. They look at the absolute dividend per share and for a history of stable but growing payments.</P>
<P>Therefore companies dislike intensely to have to reduce the dividend because this will drive away investors with possibly serious effects on share price. A company in a difficult year will often decide that it must pay a dividend in excess of earnings rather than cut the pay-out. Of course, this policy can be followed only for a short time and when there is reason to believe that earnings will recover to a figure greater than the dividends.</P></DIV>

<P>Companies adopt dividend policies to suit their business needs. These will reflect the sectors in which they operate and the specific strategies they adopt. Fast-growing companies have a great need for cash and they pay out little. On the other hand stable low-growth companies pay out a high percentage of earnings.</P>
<P>We therefore see that public utility companies are noted for high stable pay-out policies. They are therefore, very popular with investors for whom income is the most important consideration. On the other hand, some computer companies have never paid a dividend, even though they have made large profits over many years. These companies attract investors who look for capital growth.</P>

<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>

<P>The country and sectoral analysis charts in <A title="Figure&nbsp;12.7.&nbsp;Dividend cover by country and by sector" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch12.html#ch12fig07"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 12.7</FONT></A> show how closely international companies cluster around the average (Japan is the exception with a dividend cover greater than 6 times). It is not surprising, given their high historic growth rates.</P>
<P>It is worthwhile considering the implication of these numbers. Companies in the main retain more profits than they distribute. More than 50 percent of equity returns, therefore, should come from capital growth, not dividends. However, capital growth depends on the share price.</P>
<P>Most share prices show significant fluctuations around a central trend line. Therefore, the actual capital gain delivered to a particular investor is heavily dependent on the timing of the investment and its later conversion back into cash.</P>
<P>For instance, an investor in a high growth stock would suffer a capital loss if he bought at the high and sold at the low point in the cycle.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Share yield ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/12_8_1.gif" width=500></DIV></DIV>
<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;12.8.&nbsp;Share yield ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>The earnings yield shows the relationship that EPS bears to the share price. For instance, if the EPS is $1.50 and the share price is $10.00 the earnings yield is 15 percent. If the share price moved up to $15.00 the corresponding yield would be 10 percent. As the share price increases the yield falls. Paradoxically, a low yield indicates a share that is in much demand by investors. We will see in the next section its link to the price earnings ratio.</P>
<P>From the company point of view, the ratio indicates the return the company must provide to attract investors. If a company falls out of favor in the market-place the share price falls and the company is faced with a higher yield. It follows that a company with a poor image has to pay a high return to attract capital.</P>
<P>For the investor, yield calculations allow comparisons to be made between the return on shares and other types of investment, such as government stocks (gilts) or commercial property.</P>
<P>Managers of large investment funds constantly balance their portfolios between these different investment outlets. In doing so, they take account of the relative yields which change daily, together with the stability and capital growth expected in each area.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Share yield ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>Whereas the earnings yield specifies the total return, the dividend yield is more important for investors dependent on income from the shares. It allows them to compare the cash flow that they will receive from investing a fixed sum in different stocks or other investment outlets. As we have seen in the previous section, public utility companies with high pay-out ratios tend to produce high dividend yields and would be popular with pension fund managers.</P>
<P>The degree of variation in yield values is shown in the country variations illustrated in <A title="Figure&nbsp;12.8.&nbsp;Share yield ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch12.html#ch12fig08"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 12.8</FONT></A>. The most striking result is the dividend yield for Japan at less than 1 percent. This is brought about by the low pay-out ratio already mentioned and high share prices.</P>
<P>These yield values are low in comparison to gilt yields. The expression &#8216;reverse yield gap&#8217; is used to highlight the shortfall in dividend yields as opposed to those for gilts.<A id=iddle1308 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1408 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1423 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1619 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1639 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1726 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1826 class=indexterm></A></P></DIV>

<P>The price to earnings ratio or &#8216;multiple&#8217; is a widely quoted parameter of share value. <A title="Figure&nbsp;12.9.&nbsp;Price/earnings ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch12.html#ch12fig09"><FONT color=#0066cc>Figure 12.9</FONT></A> shows the method of calculation. The share price is divided by the EPS figure. The answer gives the number of years&#8217; purchase that the price bears to earnings.</P></DIV>
<P>While the calculation of the ratio is based on figures from the past, its value is determined by investors whose focus is on the future. They are primarily interested in the prospects for <SPAN class=strong><STRONG>earnings growth</STRONG></SPAN>. To estimate this they will look to the industrial sector, the company&#8217;s products, its management and its financial stability and growth history.</P>
<P>The company has no direct control over the PE ratio. It may influence it over the short-term by a good public relations exercise. In the long-term, however, it must deliver a good return to the equity shareholder to secure a continued high rating.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/hand.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>The advantages of a high price to earnings ratio value are considerable. The wealth of the company&#8217;s owners is increased in proportion. New funds can be raised at a favorable price. The possibility of a successful hostile takeover bid is much reduced. Most importantly, the company has the means to make acquisitions on favorable terms by using its &#8216;paper&#8217; (shares), as opposed to cash.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>When we look at the P/E ratio across international boundaries (see <A title="Figure&nbsp;12.9.&nbsp;Price/earnings ratios for the Example Co. plc and by country" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch12.html#ch12fig09"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 12.9</FONT></A>), we see that the US and the UK show similiar values just short of 30 times. The returns for the EU are considerably lower, but we notice a considerable jump when we come to Japan. Here the current value is approximately 28, even though the market has fallen by 50 percent.</P>
<P>Japanese P/E values have puzzled western investors for years. A short while ago, many companies were in the 50 to 60 range. Attempts to explain this mentioned very low inflation rates, strong currency, low cost of capital etc. However stockmarket prices fell sharply and rates, while still high, are now more in line with western world norms.</P>

<P><A id=iddle1546 class=indexterm></A><A id=iddle1821 class=indexterm></A>The market to book ratio gives the final and, perhaps the most thorough assessment by the stockmarket of a company&#8217;s overall status.

The ratio relates the total market capitalization of the company to the shareholders&#8217; funds. To express it in another way, it compares the value in the stockmarket with the shareholders&#8217; investment in the company.</P>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;12.10.&nbsp;Market to book ratio for the Example Co. plc and by country</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>The answer will be less than, greater than or equal to unity. It is the investors&#8217; perception of the performance of the company in terms of profits, balance sheet strength or liquidity and growth that determines this ratio.</P>
<P>A value of less than unity means that the shareholders&#8217; investment has diminished in value; it has wasted away. The investing community have given a &#8216;thumbs down&#8217; signal to the company. They do not anticipate that future profits will be sufficient to justify the current owners&#8217; investment in the company.</P>
<P>On the other hand, when this value is well in excess of unity, it means that the investment has been multiplied by the market/book factor. A high ratio does not simply mean that the worth of the company has increased over time by means of its retained earnings. The multiplier acts in addition to this. Each $1 of original investment, plus each $1 of retained earnings is multiplied by a factor equal to the market to book ratio.</P>

In normal circumstances we would expect a value of between 2 and 3 times for this ratio, and these are the values we see for the EU and Japan. The extraordinary high values we encounter in the US and UK can only be accounted for by:</P>

It looks formidable at first sight because there seem to be so many parts to it.</P>
<P>However, we will work carefully through it. There are approximately six separate steps. Each step is simple in itself. The result of the exercise will be total comprehension of quite a difficult subject. Once this is achieved the remaining material will be very easy to follow.</P>

<P>The chart is constructed on a base that represents the total funds in the business divided between total equity ($208.90) and total non-equity ($307.90).</P>
<LI class=step>
<P><A id=ch13pro01_st2></A>Where equity and non-equity meet we draw to scale a vertical line representing ROTA (17.9 percent).</P>
<LI class=step>
<P><A id=ch13pro01_st3></A>At the extreme left of the base we place a vertical line representing the average cost of all non-equity funds (2.8 percent). (The amount of &#8216;free&#8217; funds in the balance sheet, e.g. accounts payable, accounts for this apparently low value.)</P>
<LI class=step>
<P>At the extreme right of the base we erect a vertical line to represent ROE (before tax).</P>
<LI class=step>
<P>We join the upper limit of the &#8216;Interest&#8217; line (Step 3) to the upper limit of the &#8216;ROTA&#8217; line (Step 2) and extend this diagonal to meet the ROE line (Step 4).</P>
<LI class=step>
<P>The point where these two lines meet represents ROE value (before tax).</P></LI></OL></DIV>
<P>For the US Consolidated Company Inc. the ROE (before tax) figure is 40.5 percent. Corporation tax charged in the accounts averages 32 percent. We deduct this amount to arrive at ROE (after tax) 27.6 percent.</P>

<P><A id=iddle1539 class=indexterm></A>ROE drives company value. There are those who will dispute this statement. With good logic they will argue this is too simple an explanation because ROE is a short-term accounting measure. It does not take into account future growth prospects, etc. Nevertheless we can say that, other things being equal, the most important driver of value is ROE.</P></DIV>
<P>We have identified the drivers of ROE in the previous section. The most important are ROTA and the debt/equity ratio. The factors that drive ROTA are &#8216;margin&#8217; and &#8216;turn&#8217; (sales/total assets ratio) as we saw in <A title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Performance drivers" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch07.html"><FONT color=#0066cc>chapter 7</FONT></A>. Standing behind the &#8216;margin&#8217; and &#8216;turn&#8217; are all the operating ratios. So it is ROE that brings together all the operating and financing characteristics of the business.</P>
<P>We therfore can trace a path from the shop floor to stockmarket value.</P>
<P>However we need to examine a little more the factors that help the stockmarket decide on the earnings yield it will demand from a particular company.</P>

<P><SPAN class=italic>Note: An increase in the debt/equity value has a double effect, it increases return on equity but it also increases risk and therefore normally results in a higher &#8216;earnings yield&#8217; value. The increase in return on equity should increase corporate value but if debt/equity is pushed beyond a prudent level the resulting increase in the yield will actually reduce total value.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=italic>One can work back from a desired end result to determine what the value of any single input variable must be, if other inputs remain constant. For instance, if the management set a target of 21.5 percent for ROE, they could work back to determine that the value of ROTA needed to deliver that is 14.4 percent.</SPAN><A id=iddle1355 class=indexterm></A>

There is a need for balance between profits, assets and growth (see <A title="Figure&nbsp;14.1.&nbsp;Growth and the need for balance" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch14.html#ch14fig01"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 14.1</FONT></A>). Any imbalance between these factors will impact strongly on cash flow. Given the opportunities and corresponding dangers of growth, particularly in times of high inflation, it is wise to consider whether there is some way in which we can specify for a company what level of growth it can safely absorb. This chapter illustrates one particular method that many companies have found useful.</P></DIV>

<P>We see that it has been growing, in terms of sales, at approximately 15 percent per annum. However, it has a rapidly deteriorating financial position. The current ratio has dropped from 2.3 to 1.4 times over the four years and the debt to total assets ratio has risen from 37 percent to 61 percent over the same period. The liquidity ratios were very strong in 1997 but have sunk to their lowest acceptable level by 2001. The most worrying aspect of the case is the speed at which the liquidity position has deteriorated.</P>
<P>Performance, as measured by return on equity, was low but improved significantly in 2001. It made a passable return of almost 20 percent before tax to its shareholders, but it is now close to a liquidity crisis. Accordingly, management must take urgent action to stop the downward trend and change the direction in which the company is going.</P>
<P>This chapter is concerned with the problem of identifying and quantifying the options open to management, but, more importantly, it will extract general rules relating to company growth and how it can be handled.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="CABCO Construction Ltd &#8211; summary accounts for years 1997, 1999, 2001" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>

The total assets of the 2001 balance sheet are 70 percent greater than that for 1997. From the size of the individual balance sheet boxes we see that the major expansion is in both current assets and current liabilities. An explosion in the value of current assets has been financed almost entirely by an increase in current liabilities. Because of this the company has drifted from a strong liquidity base into an unstable, high-risk financial position. If the drift continues, bankruptcy is the likely result &#8211; or at least a change of ownership and control.</P>

<P>The immediate problem is an excess of short-term borrowings. They cannot be increased and, if possible, they should be reduced. Possible courses of action to which management has already given consideration are:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>reducing investment in current assets in absolute terms or at least as a proportion of sales</P>
<LI class=listitem>

<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/questionmark.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>Because of industry custom and the situation of the business, management were of the opinion that current assets could not be reduced relative to sales, so attention was, therefore, concentrated on the possibility of finding additional long-term funds. The questions they had to answer were:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>&#8216;<SPAN class=emphasis><EM>How much?</EM></SPAN>&#8217;</P>

<LI class=listitem>
<P>&#8216;<SPAN class=emphasis><EM>If loan, what term of years?</EM></SPAN>&#8217;</P></LI></UL></DIV></DIV>
<P>When cash flow forecasts were produced, it quickly became evident that a long-term loan would not solve the problem as such borrowed money could not be repaid. Instead, more and more borrowings would be required because of the negative cash flow that this company generated each year. By negative cash flow is meant that sufficient funds are not being generated internally to fund the assets required by the operations.</P>
<P>Companies in such a heavily negative cash flow position have a form of financial diabetes. They have a perpetual cash haemorrhage because the values of certain operating parameters are out of balance. It is necessary to identify and quantify the factors behind this condition.</P></DIV>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;14.4.&nbsp;CABCO Construction Ltd &#8211; critical asset, profit and growth relationships</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>It will be shown that it is the interrelationships between these three values, combined with the company&#8217;s rate of growth that has given rise to its present financing problem. These three values, with a growth rate of 15 percent collectively, give rise to a strong negative cash flow.</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>The relationship of current assets to sales is 0.67</STRONG></SPAN> ($1,521/$2,280): each $1 of sales requires 67&#162; to carry it. For every increase of $1,000 sales next year, $670 of extra current assets will be needed. This will require $670 of extra funds in the balance sheet.<A id=ch14fn01 class=footnote href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch14.html#ftn.ch14fn01"><SUP class=footnote><FONT color=#0066cc>[*]</FONT></SUP></A></P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P><SPAN class=strong><STRONG>The relationship of retained earnings to sales is 0.02</STRONG></SPAN> ($44/$2,280): each $1 of sales generates 2&#162; of retained earnings which goes into balance sheet funds. But each extra $1 sales requires 67&#162;. Therefore $33 of sales in any year are needed to fund $1 of extra sales the following year.<SUP><A class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch14.html#ch14fn01"><FONT color=#0066cc>[*]</FONT></A></SUP></P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>This ratio of $1 extra sales for every $33 existing sales is the self-financing ratio and it gives a growth rate of 3 percent. This rate of 3 percent is the rate of growth in current assets the company can fund from its retained earnings. The company has been growing at 15 percent over the last 4 years. The excess growth of 12 percent has been funded by borrowing. In this company, all the borrowing has been short term, hence the financing problem.</P>
<P>Current sales are $2,280. If 12 percent of this has to be funded externally next year at the rate of 67&#162; for each $1 sale, the company will have to borrow an extra $180. The following year it will need to borrow $180 plus 15 percent and so on, indefinitely.</P>
<P>There is a fundamental problem here that arises from the fact that the relationships identified above are out of balance. This problem is analyzed in the next section.</P></DIV>

<H1 class=title><A id=ch14lev1sec3></A>Growth equilibrium</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P><A id=iddle1425 class=indexterm></A>We use the term &#8216;growth equilibrium&#8217; to identify the rate of growth that a company can sustain from its operating cash flow. It means that cash is in equilibrium in the sense that it is driven neither into surplus nor deficit as a result of growth.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Growth equilibrium" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>A growth equilibrium equation applicable to CABCO is given in <A title="Figure&nbsp;14.5.&nbsp;CABCO Construction Ltd &#8211; growth equilibrium equation" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch14.html#ch14fig05"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 14.5</FONT></A>.

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;14.5.&nbsp;CABCO Construction Ltd &#8211; growth equilibrium equation</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>When E = 1, cash flow is neutral; values greater than 1 indicate a positive cash flow and vice versa.<A id=ch14fn03 class=footnote href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch14.html#ftn.ch14fn03"><SUP class=footnote><FONT color=#0066cc>[*]</FONT></SUP></A></P>
<P>The values for CABCO give a result of one over five, 20 percent (Section B). This is the fraction of the growth that is self-funded. It tells us that 80 percent is funded from outside sources. The heavy borrowing that the company has experienced derives from this fact.</P>
<P>The model has identified the three powerful cash flow drivers in this company:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>current assets to sales</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>retained earnings to sales</P>
<LI class=listitem>
<P>growth in sales.</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<P>The company requires very high levels of inventory and accounts receivable to support sales. As sales expand rapidly these do likewise, thereby creating a great demand for cash. Retained profits are not adequate to meet this need.</P>
<P>The model enables management to focus on the fundamental issues facing this company. These relate to profit, current assets and growth. Management must take steps to balance the relationship between these three so that the equilibrium value (&#8216;E&#8217;) is increased from .02 up to 1.0.</P>
<P>Some scenarios are illustrated in <A title="Figure&nbsp;14.6.&nbsp;CABCO Construction Ltd &#8211; growth equilibrium calculation" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch14.html#ch14fig06"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 14.6</FONT></A>.</P>

<P>As stated above, management can focus on the essential elements of the problem. The three variables must be brought into balance so that the resulting equilibrium value &#8216;E&#8217; is increased to at least 1.0. This is the position where the company does not have to seek any further outside funds.</P>

<LI class=listitem>
<P>Retained profit</P>
<LI class=listitem>

<P>Each one shows the change in that variable alone that would be required to achieve equilibrium. It is not likely that any one of these in isolation would be the most practical solution.

<P>This version of the growth model is built up from the relationships that exist between between current assets, retained earnings and growth in a particular company.</P>
<P>It gives valid results for a company in the situation of CABCO Construction Ltd. This company is heavily current-assets-based and very heavily borrowed. The version is also useful, with slight amendments, for trading companies and rapidly growing small businesses.</P>

<P>The final growth equilibrium equation (RE/OF) in <A title="Figure&nbsp;14.7.&nbsp;Adjustments to growth equilibrium model" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch14.html#ch14fig07"><FONT color=#0066cc>figure 14.7</FONT></A> tells us that the self-funding rate of growth for a company is calculated by expressing the retained earnings as a percentage of owners&#8217; funds (using the opening balance sheet for the period). Growth in excess of this rate will require extra equity or will cause a weakening in ratios.</P></DIV>

<P>The assumptions that lie behind this formula are important. They are that growth in sales will be matched exactly by growth in both current and fixed assets. It is further assumed that profits, interest, tax and dividends will grow likewise. Finally, it is assumed that a constant debt to equity ratio will apply.</P></DIV>

<P><SPAN class=italic>It is not necessary to emphasize that a company cannot be managed by formulae. What formulae can do, however, is provide a shorthand approach that will quickly identify potential problems.</SPAN></P></DIV>

<P class=title><STRONG>Figure&nbsp;14.8.&nbsp;Self-funding growth rate %</STRONG></P></DIV></DIV>
<P>Chart A is derived from research done with top UK companies in 2000, and chart B relates to research on international companies.</P>
<P>Both indicate that large international companies have sustainable growth rates of between 10 and 20 percent, except Japan with approximately 7 percent. These are all very high numbers. With inflation as low as 3 to 4 percent it suggests that they have the capacity to expand in real terms at well over 8 percent. If their actual growth is less then they will simply accumulate cash in the balance sheet.</P>
<P>Given that the developed economies, in stable times over the long term, grow at 4 percent maximum, these companies are significantly outgrowing the economy. One can see why so many of them are involved in takeover activity. We have seen that these companies are also very profitable and many of them find it difficult to acquire companies that will not dilute their profit performance.</P>
<P>Some have found another outlet for surplus cash which is to buy back their own shares in the marketplace. This is a phenomenon that can now be observed with many large profitable companies.</P></DIV></DIV>

<H1 class=title><A id=ch14lev1sec4></A>Application to acquisitions</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Many groups acquire fast-growing businesses in order to sustain or enhance the growth rate of the parent. The cash flow characteristics of such acquisitions are of crucial importance.</P>
<P>A company that has heavy asset requirements, and that grows rapidly, will need substantial funds to keep its balance sheet in good condition. If the company is very profitable, these funds may be generated internally. However, if it has only medium or low profits, then funds will have to be provided by the parent company. The total cost of such a company over a number of years could be many times its original purchase price.</P>
<DIV class=mediaobject><img alt="Application to acquisitions" src="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/graphics/percentage.jpg" width=30></DIV>
<P>The most valuable business to own or buy is one with high growth and high profits. The least valuable one is not a low growth, low profit company. Such a company is not worth very much, but it is not dangerous. The worst company is one with high growth and low profits. If such a company also has a high asset to sales ratio, then it has, within itself, all the makings of a financial disaster.</P></DIV>

However, this is an early and primitive, but useful, version of a more generalized growth model that will be developed later in the chapter.
