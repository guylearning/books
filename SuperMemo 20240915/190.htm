A comparison by country (see <A title="Figure&nbsp;6.11.&nbsp;Margin on sales and sales to total asset ratios by country" class=link href="https://guylearning.github.io/books/key-management-ratios-9780273707318/ch06.html#ch06fig11">figure 6.11</A>) shows a strong similarity between companies in the US and the UK. In the US a slightly lower margin is accompanied by a somewhat higher &#8216;sales to total assets&#8217;. However the size of the sample would not allow us to give great statistical significance to these variations.

<P>Companies in the EU seem to operate on lower margins and their asset utilization is also low. Companies in Japan operate on low margins but appear to have a somewhat better assets utilization. This latest finding runs contrary to popular belief. Much has been written about Japanese achievements in operating with very low inventory levels. While this may be true in specific industries it does not seem to hold across a wide range of companies.</P>

<P>A rule of thumb would be that a margin of approximately 10 percent, combined with an asset turn of between 1.3 and 1.5 would be where many western companies would find a comfortable and profitable position.</P></DIV>
<P>It rests with the skill of each management team to discover for itself the unique combination of margin and asset turn that will give their company its own particular, and successful, market niche.
