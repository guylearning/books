<P class=indent><A id=page_54>I&#8217;ll talk about this issue more in chapter 5, but for now it&#8217;s enough to say the best methodology is to manage your personal expenses so you can take care of your business and not live off distributions. Remember, it&#8217;s about keeping your cow (your business) healthy. It probably won&#8217;t take as long as you think before you can pay yourself a market-based salary. At my practice we&#8217;ve been able to forecast that date. In many cases businesses are fully capitalized in twelve to eighteen months, and the owners can start paying themselves a market-based wage. Knowing a tentative date will give you the courage to hang on until that day comes. <A id=page_55>When it&#8217;s some unknown date in the future, people are tempted to live off the business prematurely.</A>
