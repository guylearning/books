<p class="ChapterTitle">Capital Allocation</p>
<div>
<p class="noindent"><i>Capital allocation</i> is the process used to analyze projects and decide which ones should or should not be included in the company’s <i>capital budget</i> (plan for spending money on growth and sustaining current operations). This chapter gives you the tools to make these decisions based upon potential growth and profitability. After the analysis has been performed, the capital budget itself outlines the planned expenditures on capital assets. The capital allocation process is important as it outlines the long-term investment strategy of the company.</p>
<p class="indent">The tools that we wil<a id="cXXX.123"></a>l describe in this chapter are:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li>Net present value (NPV)<a id="cXXX.k8"></a></li>
<li>Internal rate of return (IRR)<a id="cXXX.k7"></a></li>
<li>Modified internal rate of return (MIRR)</li>
<li>Payback method</li>
<li>Discounted payback method</li>
<li>Profitability index (PI)</li>
<li>Total cost of ownership (TCO)</li></ul>
<p class="indent">Large projects with high risk require more analysis. Smaller projects or replacement projects can often be analyzed by simply looking at the payback method or the internal rate of return.</p>
<p class="indent">These tools provide a variety of information to the key decision makers. By using Microsoft Excel it is very easy to set up the various formulas and compare each project’s costs, benefits, and rates of return against those of others.</p>
<p id="Sec1" class="Heading1">Net present value (NPV)</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>net present value</i> (NPV) of a proje<a id="cXXX.124"></a><a id="cXXX.125"></a>ct is the present value of the future cash inflows less the present value of the future cash outflows discounted at the cost of capital (WACC). The higher the net present value, the more desirable it is to undertake the project.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit. The cost of the new unit is $4,650 and is estimated to produce net cash inflows in the amount of $5,520 over a three-year period. At the end of year three, the value of the production unit will be equal to zero.</p>
<p class="indent">The easiest way to calculate a projects NPV  is to set up the year over year cash flows in Excel and use the Excel “=NPV” function to calculate the return as illustrated here:</p>
<p class="img"><img src="images/9781484207321_unFig04-01.jpg" alt="9781484207321_unFig04-01.jpg" width="502" height="294"/></p>
<p class="indent">Based on the initial investment, the expected cash inflows, and the cost of capital of 5%, the new production unit will have an NPV of $296. This number can be compared to other projects to help determine a course of action with regard to capital allocation. At the very least, this number is positive and indicates that it is a worthwhile investment by itself, but perhaps not when compared to others or when considering the capital constrains of the company.</p>
<p id="Sec2" class="Heading1">Internal rate of return (IRR)</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">A project’s <i>internal rate of return</i> (IRR) indicates t<a id="cXXX.126"></a><a id="cXXX.127"></a>he discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash in and out flows from the specific project equal zero under the assumption that the return can be reinvested at the same rate (the IRR rate). This number is not necessarily helpful to managers by itself, but only when compared to the IRR of other projects and to the company’s WACC. The higher a project's internal rate of return, the more desirable it is to undertake the project.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit. The cost of the new unit is $4,650 and is estimated to produce net cash inflows in the amount of $5,520 over a three year period as laid out in the spreadsheet shown here. At the end of year three, the value of the production unit will be equal to zero. The easiest way to calculate a project’s IRR is to set up the year over year cash flows in Excel and use the Excel “=IRR” function to calculate the return as illustrated here:</p>
<p class="img"><img src="images/9781484207321_unFig04-02.jpg" alt="9781484207321_unFig04-02.jpg" width="502" height="294"/></p>
<p class="indent">Based on the expected cash flows, the new production unit will have an internal rate of return (IRR) of 7.94%. Again, this IRR alone tells you very little; it needs to be compared to other projects’ IRRs and to the company’s WACC in order to determine if the project should be pursued or not.</p>
<p id="Sec3" class="Heading1">Modified internal rate of return (MIRR)</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Modified internal rate of return</i> (MIRR) is no<a id="cXXX.128"></a><a id="cXXX.129"></a> different than the internal rate of return (IRR) except that is assumes that the cash flows from the project are reinvested at the company’s cost of capital (WACC) instead of the IRR. This makes MIRR a better indicator of the project’s true benefit to the organization. The higher a project's modified internal rate of return, the more desirable it is to undertake the project.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit. The cost of the new unit is $4,650 and is estimated to produce net cash inflows in the amount of $5,520 over a three-year period as shown below. At the end of year three, the value of the production unit will be equal to zero.</p>
<p class="indent">The easiest way to calculate a projects MIRR is to set up the year over year cash flows in Excel and use the Excel “=MIRR” function to calculate the return as illustrated here:</p>
<p class="img"><img src="images/9781484207321_unFig04-03.jpg" alt="9781484207321_unFig04-03.jpg" width="502" height="294"/></p>
<p class="indent">Based on the expected cash flows and a WACC of 5%, the new production unit will have MIRR of 7.18%. Again, the MIRR alone tells you very little; it needs to be compared to other projects MIRRs and to the company’s WACC in order to determine if the project should be pursued or not.</p>
<p id="Sec4" class="Heading1">Payback method</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>payback method</i> measures th<a id="cXXX.130"></a><a id="cXXX.131"></a>e time it takes for a company to recover the capital invested in the project. The model does not consider the time value of money, nor does it consider the cash flows beyond the payback period. In general, the shorter the payback period, the more desirable it is to undertake the project. The payback method is usually considered a “quick and dirty” capital allocation<a id="cXXX.k2"></a> tool given these simplifying assumptions.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit that costs $7,540 and is estimated to produce net cash inflows in the amount of $9,200 over a six-year period. Excel does not have a payback function but it can be calculated manually, by looking at the year where the cumulative cash flow becomes positive and dividing the cash flow from that year by the amount needed to become positive and adding it to that year.</p>
<p class="img"><img src="images/9781484207321_unFig04-04.jpg" alt="9781484207321_unFig04-04.jpg" width="452" height="435"/></p>
<p class="indent">Based on the expected cash flow, the payback period for the new production unit is 2.54 years.</p>
<p id="Sec5" class="Heading1">Discounted Payback method</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>discounted payback method</i> measu<a id="cXXX.132"></a>res the time it takes for a company to recover the capital invested in the project. The discounted payback model takes into consideration the time value of money by di<a id="cXXX.133"></a>scounting the cash flows at the cost of capital (WACC). This makes it a better indicator when compared to the regular payback method. In general, the shorter the discounted payback period, the more desirable it is to undertake the project.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit. The cost of the new unit is $7,540 and is estimated to produce cash inflows in the amount of $9,200 over a six-year period. There is no specific function in excel to calculate the discounted payback period. However, it can be calculated manually as outlined below, where the payback period is the period in which the cumulative cash flow becomes positive.</p>
<p class="img"><img src="images/9781484207321_unFig04-05.jpg" alt="9781484207321_unFig04-05.jpg" width="402" height="383"/></p>
<p class="indent">Based on the expected cash flow and the cost of capital, the payback period for the new production unit is 3.35 years. This is slightly longer than the regular payback period as it takes into consideration the time value of money.</p>
<p id="Sec6" class="Heading1">Profitability index</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>profitability index</i> measures t<a id="cXXX.134"></a><a id="cXXX.135"></a>he relative profitability of a project calculated by dividing the present value of future cash flows of a project by the initial investment required for the project. The higher the profitability index, the more desirable it is to undertake the project. A value less than one indicate that the present value of the project is less that the initial investment and is therefore a bad investment.</p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company considers investing in one additional production unit. The cost of the new unit is $4,650 and is estimated to produce cash inflows in the amount of $5,520 over a three-year period. At the end of year three, the value of the production unit will be equal to zero. Discounting the future cash inflows at a discount rate of 5% (WACC) gives a present value of $4,946.</p>
<p class="img"><img src="images/9781484207321_unFig04-06.jpg" alt="9781484207321_unFig04-06.jpg" width="490" height="348"/></p>
<p class="indent">Based on the initial investment, the expected future cash flow and the cost of capital of 5% the new production unit will have a Profitability index of 1.06 indicating that the present value of the future cash flow is larger than the initial investment.</p>
<p id="Sec7" class="Heading1">Total cost of ownership (TCO)</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The tools discussed previously in <a id="cXXX.136"></a><a id="cXXX.137"></a>this section are used to determine which projects should and should not be included in the capital budget. These tools often only highlight the direct benefits of the specific project under consideration. Good managers know that most projects do not exist in a vacuum and that there are often intangible benefits and drawbacks associated with new projects that modeling does not always include.</p>
<p class="indent">A <i>total-cost of ownership</i> (TCO)<a id="cXXX.k13"></a> analysis can be used to measure the current and future contribution that a projects implementation adds to the company. Its focus is not solely on quantitative measures but also qualitative measures that include direct and indirect benefits.</p>
<p class="indent">Direct benefits are cash flows directly associated with the project. Indirect benefits include items such as overhead, operating and maintenance, productivity improvement, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">Measuring qualitative benefits can be much harder as these are softer benefits, such as employee satisfaction, better work environment, resulting in less sick days, and so on. Some economists call these <i>social benefits</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">TCO analyses are typically done with large projects, such as a new ERP implementation or a new office building, to afford management an overview of all the costs and benefits associated with this new initiative before allocating capital to the specific project.</p>
<p class="indent">Completing a TCO analysis is quite comprehensive and time-consuming. The main reason is that qualitative data is not easy to quantify as is often generated by interviews, observations and comparison to similar projects either within the company or with similar companies in the industry. Total cost of ownership should therefore mainly be considered with larger projects or when qualitative benefits are significant to the quantities ones.</p></div></div>
