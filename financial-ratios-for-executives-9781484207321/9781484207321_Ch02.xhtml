<p class="indent">Most ratio calculations are based on data from the hypothetical ABC Company, whose financial data are listed in that company’s income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and additional company information given in <a href="9781484207321_Ch03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Where the ABC Company data are not applicable to certain ratio calculations, we use data from the hypothetical XYZ Company.</p>
<p id="Sec1" class="Heading1">Acid test (Quick ratio)<a id="cXXX.18"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Type:</b> Liquidity measure</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-001.jpg" alt="image" width="369" height="63"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>acid test ratio</i> shows whether a company has enough short-term assets to cover its immediate liabilities without selling inventory. The higher the acid test ratio, the safer a position the company is in.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has currents assets in the amount of $69,765, inventory in the amount of $24,875, and current liabilities in the amount of $28,500. This gives an acid test of 1.58. An acid test of 1.58 indicates that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities more than one and a half times over without selling inventory.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-002.jpg" alt="image" width="327" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">The acid test is very similar to the current ratio except that it excludes inventory because inventory is often illiquid. The nature of the inventory and the industry in which the company operates will determine if the acid test or the current ratio is more applicable.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="indent">The acid test is also known as the <i>quick ratio</i>.</p>
<p id="Sec2" class="Heading1">Account receivable turnover (Receivable turnover)<a id="cXXX.19"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Type:</b> Performance measure</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-003.jpg" alt="image" width="417" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>accounts receivable turnover</i> measures the number of times receivables are converted into cash in a given period. This is different from the average collection period, which shows the number of days it takes to collect the receivables.</p>
<p class="indent">Ideally, credit sales should be used in the numerator and average receivables in the denominator. However, these are most often not easily available in the financial statements.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and accounts receivable in the amount of $28,030. This gives an accounts receivable turnover ratio of 7.49. The higher the accounts receivable turnover ratio, the better the company is at converting receivables into cash. A decline in the turnover ratio could mean either a decline in sales or an indication that the customers are taking a longer time to pay for their purchases.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-004.jpg" alt="image" width="448" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">The company can improve the turnover ratio by many methods; the most popular is by offering a discount if the customers pay their outstanding balance earlier; for example, within 30 days of the sale.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="indent">Accounts receivable turnover is also known as <i>receivable turnover</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-005.jpg" alt="image" width="421" height="79"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>additional funds needed</i> (AFN) is an approximation tool to determine how much external funding a company would require in order to increase sales (if the company is operating at full capacity), given the amount of assets needed to generate those sales. AFN tells you how much outside cash a company needs to support linear growth. Because many of the factors used in AFN require estimation, you can see that AFN really only provides a ballpark figure.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">The AFN equation can be written as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">AFN = (Ao/So) ΔS - (Lo/So) ΔS – M (S1) ´ (1 - POR)</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li>Required asset increase (Ao/So) ΔS</li>

<p id="Sec4" class="Heading1">Altman’s Z-Score<a id="cXXX.21"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Type:</b> Other</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="indent">Z-Score = 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C + 0.6D + 1.0E</p>
<p class="indent">A = Working capital/Total assets</p>
<p class="indent">B = Retained earnings/Total assets</p>
<p class="indent">C = Earnings before interest &amp; tax/Total assets</p>
<p class="indent">D = Market value of equity/Total liabilities</p>
<p class="indent">E   = Sales/Total assets</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>Altman’s Z-Score</i> was developed to predict the probability that a company will go into bankruptcy within two years. The lower the Z-Score, the greater the probability the company will go into bankruptcy within the next two years. A score less than 1.8 indicates that the company is likely headed for bankruptcy, whereas a score above 3.0 indicates that the company has a low risk of bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has a Z-Score of 5.49. This means that there is a very low probability of the company going into bankruptcy within the next two years.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Z-Score = 1.2(1.29) + 1.4(0.36) + 3.3(0.42) + 0.6(0.77) + 1.0(1.59)<br/>              = 5.49</b></p>

<p id="Sec5" class="Heading1">Asset to equity<a id="cXXX.22"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Type:</b> Debt measure</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-006.jpg" alt="image" width="396" height="71"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>asset-to-equity ratio</i> (also known as the <i>equity multiplier</i>) gives a sense of how much of the total assets of a company are really owned by shareholders as compared to those that are financed by debt. Some businesses thrive more on borrowing money (<i>leverage</i>) than other companies.</p>
<p class="indent">High assets-to-equity may be good for them. However, there is always some point for any company at which their assets are overleveraged. That can be dangerous to the shareholders and their investment in the company (e.g., Lehman Brothers was so overleveraged in 2007 that their asset-to-equity was 31! Calls on their debt in 2008 more than wiped out the company).</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has total assets in the amount of $132,000 and shareholder equity in the amount of $52,070. This gives an asset-to-equity ratio of 2.54. Thus, the business has about $2.54 of assets for every dollar of shareholder equity.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-007.jpg" alt="image" width="352" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="indent">Debt financing typically offers a lower rate compared to equity. However, too much debt financing is rarely the optimal structure because debt has to be paid back even when the company is going through troubled times.</p>
<p id="Sec6" class="Heading1">Asset turnover<a id="cXXX.23"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Type:</b> Performance measure</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-008.jpg" alt="image" width="240" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>asset turnover ratio</i> measures the sales generated per dollar of assets and is an indication of how efficient the company is in utilizing assets to generate sales.</p>
<p class="indent">Asset-intensive companies such as mining, manufacturing, and so on will generally have lower asset turnover ratios compared to companies that have fewer assets, such as consulting and service companies.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and total assets in the amount of $132,000. This gives an asset turnover ratio of 1.59.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-009.jpg" alt="image" width="310" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">This means that for every dollar invested in assets, the company generates $1.59 of sales. This number should be compared to the industry average for companies in the same industry.</p>
<p id="Sec7" class="Heading1">Audit ratio<a id="cXXX.24"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Type:</b> Other</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-010.jpg" alt="image" width="288" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>audit ratio</i> measures the cost of an audit in relation to the sales of the company. An increase in the audit ratio could indicate that additional audit procedures were required because of problems with the company’s accounting records or control procedures. It could also indicate additional procedures were needed because of a change in legislation. When the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was written into law, it resulted in significant increases in audit fees as a result of additional testing and control procedures.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and annual audit fees in the amount of $200. This results in an audit ratio of 0.095%.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-011.jpg" alt="image" width="300" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="indent">There is not always a direct correlation between the revenue and the annual audit fee, and it can vary significantly between various industries. However, as a company grows, so, typically, do the audit fees. Within the same company this number can be trended over time.</p>
<p id="Sec8" class="Heading1">Average collection period<a id="cXXX.25"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Type:</b> Performance measure</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-012.jpg" alt="image" width="525" height="71"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>average collection period</i> indicates the amount of time (in days) it takes a company to convert its receivables into cash.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has accounts receivable in the amount of $28,030 and credit sales in the amount of $210,000. In this example, credit sales and total sales are identical. This gives an average collection period of 48.72 days, which means that it takes a little over one and a half months for the company to convert credit sales into cash.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-013.jpg" alt="image" width="513" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">The company’s credit terms will have a significant impact on the average collection period: the better the credit terms, the higher the average collection period. An increase in the average collection period could indicate an increased risk of the company’s customers not being able to pay for their purchases. A possible result is that the company will have to hold greater levels of current assets as a reserve for potential losses or bad debt expense. Most large companies (nonretail) do not handle many cash sales. Therefore, when looking at financial statements, it can be assumed that total sales do not include any cash sales. However, in smaller companies and in retail businesses, cash sales can be a significant part of the total sales.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="indent">The average collection period is also known as days sales outstanding.</p>
<p id="Sec9" class="Heading1">Basic earning power (BEP)<a id="cXXX.26"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Type:</b> Profitability measure</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-014.jpg" alt="image" width="342" height="71"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>basic earning power</i> (BEP) shows the earning power of the company’s assets before taxes and debt service. It is useful for comparing companies that otherwise could not be compared because of different tax situations and different degrees of financial leverage. This ratio is often used as a measure of the effectiveness of operations.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the amount of $13,525 and total assets in the amount of $132,500. This gives a basic earnings power ratio (BEP) of 0.10.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-015.jpg" alt="image" width="360" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">This means that for every $100 invested in assets the company generates $10 of EBIT. This number can be compared to industry averages, or other companies, to gauge the operational effectiveness of generating profits.</p>
<p id="Sec10" class="Heading1">Book value per share<a id="cXXX.27"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Type:</b> Market value measure</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-016.jpg" alt="image" width="404" height="69"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>book value per share</i> measures common stockholders’ equity determined on a per-share basis and is an indication of how the investors view the value of the company’s assets. If the market value per share is higher than the book value per share, then the investor is willing to pay a premium over the book value to acquire the company’s assets.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has common equity in the amount of $52,070 and a total of 10,000 shares outstanding. This gives a book value per share of $5.20 at December 31, 2013.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-017.jpg" alt="image" width="360" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has a market value per share of $6.15. The reason could be that there are certain intangibles assets within the company such as customer list, distribution channels, or know-how, and so on, which the company cannot record as an asset under U.S. or international accounting standards. As a result of this, the investor is willing to pay a premium over book value to acquire the assets of the company.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-018.jpg" alt="image" width="425" height="56"/></p>
<p class="indent">With a share price of $6.15, the market value of the equity is $61,500, which means that the investor value the company’s assets to $141.430, $9,430 over book value.</p>
<p id="Sec11" class="Heading1">Breakeven point<a id="cXXX.28"></a></p>

<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-019.jpg" alt="image" width="419" height="69"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>breakeven point,</i> often used in cost accounting, is the point at which the company breaks even on a given product and neither incurs a profit nor a loss. The breakeven point shows the minimum amount of sales required for the company to begin making a profit.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">XYZ Company is considering investing in a new production unit that costs $1,000,000 to support the increased demands in sales. The fixed cost for the new unit once installed is $200,000 annually. The company has calculated a contribution margin of 68%. This gives a breakeven point of $292,306, or 61,538 units.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-020.jpg" alt="image" width="360" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent">This table shows that the company breaks even, meaning that it incurs neither a profit nor a loss, when it sells 61.538 units which amounts to sales of $292,306.</p>

<p id="Sec12" class="Heading1">Capital asset pricing model (CAPM)<a id="cXXX.29"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Type:</b> Other</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-021.jpg" alt="image" width="515" height="42"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>capital asset pricing model</i> (CAPM) is a theoretical model used to determine the required rate of return for an investor when considering a particular stock to purchase. The stock’s required rate of return is equal to the risk-free rate of return plus a risk premium reflecting only the risk remaining after diversification.</p>
<p class="indent">Investors most often use 10-year U.S. treasury bill or bond rate as a proxy for the risk-free rate. Beta is most often calculated by a third party and is available online. Market risk premium is the market rate of return less the risk-free rate. The market rate of return can be based on past returns. The economist Peter Bernstein calculated the average rate of return to be 9.6% over the past 200 years. This rate of return is often applied by investors when using the capital asset pricing model.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">An investor could use CAPM to determine the required rate of return to invest in ABC Company. If we assume that the rate of a 10-year U.S. treasury bill is 2%, the Beta for ABC Company is 0.9, and the market rate of return is 9.6%, we can calculate CAPM as follows:</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-022.jpg" alt="image" width="513" height="42"/></p>
<p class="indent">By using CAPM, an investor can compare the required rate of return to an expected rate of return for the company over the investment horizon. If the investor does not think that the stock will yield a return of 8.84% over the investment period, he should not buy the stock.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>capital structure ratio,</i> also known as the capitalization ratio, measures the debt component of a company’s capital structure or how much of the company’s financing is represented by long-term debt.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>cash conversion cycle</i> indicates the number of days that a company’s cash is tied up in the production and sales process of its operations. The shorter the cycle, the more liquid the company’s working capital is.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has currents days in inventory of 43.25 days, days sales outstanding of 48.72, and a days payable outstanding of 41.34 days. This gives a cash conversation cycle (CCC) of 50.63 days.</p>

Earnings can theoretically be manipulated from quarter to quarter more easily than cash can. Thus, tracking cash flow per share can show a better picture of what is going on with the company.</p>
<p class="indent">Some financial analysts place more emphasis on cash flow than earnings as a measure of the company’s financial situation.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has operating cash flow in the amount of $8,145. There are no preferred shares in ABC Company; thus, there is no preferred dividend. Total number of shares outstanding amounts to 10,000. This gives a cash flow per share of $0.81 as of December 31, 2013.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-030.jpg" alt="image" width="365" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">This number can be compared to industry averages or other companies in the same industry to compare operational effectiveness at generating cash.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>cash flow to debt ratio</i> indicates the company’s ability to cover total debt with its annual cash flow from operations. A high cash flow to debt ratio puts the company in a strong position to cover its total debt.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has cash flow from operations in the amount of $8,145 and total debt (short term and long term) in the amount of $22,005. This gives a cash flow to debt ratio of 0.37.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-032.jpg" alt="image" width="379" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">A cash flow to debt ratio of 0.37 indicates that it will take the company over three years (i.e., 3.7 times) to cover its total debt. This number can be compared to industry averages or other companies to compare debt loads.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>cash ratio</i> measures the company’s liquidity. It further refines both the current ratio and the quick ratio by measuring the amount of cash and cash equivalents there are in current assets to cover current liabilities.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $16,450 and current liabilities in the amount of $28,500. This gives a cash ratio of 0.58.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>collection period</i> indicates the amount of time (in days) that it takes a company to convert its receivables into cash.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has accounts receivable in the amount of $28,030 and credit sales in the amount of $210,000. In this example, credit sales and total sales are identical. This gives a collection period of 48.72 days, which means that it takes a little over one and a half months for the company to convert credit sales into cash.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-036.jpg" alt="image" width="435" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">The company’s credit terms will have a significant impact on the average collection period: the better the credit terms, the higher the average collection period. An increase in the collection period could indicate increased risk of the company’s customers not being able to pay for their purchases. A possible result is that the company will have to hold greater levels of current assets as a reserve for potential losses or bad debt expense. Most large companies (nonretail) do not handle many cash sales. Therefore, when looking at financial statements; it can be assumed that total sales do not include any cash sales. However, in smaller companies and in retail businesses, cash sales can be a significant part of the total sales.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>cost of capital,</i> also known as weighted average cost of capital or WACC, measures the company’s average costs of financing. Companies have many sources of capital, mostly debt and equity.</p>
<p class="indent">WACC measures the weighted average cost of these two sources. This rate is most often used in capital allocation for evaluating future projects. In general, all projects that the company takes on should yield a return greater that the weighted average cost of capital.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has total debt in the amount of $79,930. The weight of the company’s financing is 61% debt and 39% equity, the rate of which is financed at 7% and 13%, respectively. The company’s effective tax rate is 22%. Tax rate used in the calculation should be the company’s effective tax rate and not the statutory rate.</p>
<p class="indent">This gives a weighted average cost of capital in the amount of 8.40%. Projects that are not expected to return greater than 8.40% would generally be declined unless they show some other noneconomic benefit to the company.</p>

<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-045.jpg" alt="image" width="319" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>current ratio</i> indicates the extent to which current liabilities can be “covered” by current assets. Current assets include inventory, accounts receivable, cash, and securities. Current liabilities include accounts payable, short-term notes, current portion of long term debt, and accrued expenses.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has currents assets in the amount of $69,765 and current liabilities in the amount of $28,500. This gives a current ratio of 2.45.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-046.jpg" alt="image" width="288" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the company has almost two and a half times more current assets than current liabilities. This number is useful for comparison with industry trends but includes so many items from the financial statements that a deeper dive is often required to determine if a ratio is “good.”</p>
<p class="indent">For example, a company using a just-in-time inventory system may have low inventory, making their current ratio lower but not necessarily indicating that there is a problem with meeting short-term obligations. Likewise, a company with bloated inventory may have a high current ratio and still have problems meeting short-term obligations.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>current yield,</i> also known as dividend yield, is a measure of an investment’s return. The higher the current yield, the higher the return on the investment.</p>
<p class="indent">Typically, only profitable companies pay out dividends; therefore, investors often view companies that have paid out significant dividends for an extended period of time as a less risky investment.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has paid out dividend per share in the amount of $0.30 and has a share price at the end of the year in the amount of $6.15 per share.

<p class="indent">Days payable ratio of 41.33 means that the company pays its suppliers 41.33 days after receiving the products. The days payable period is a reflection of the credit terms that are extended to the company by its supplier. In general, a ratio much higher than the industry average could mean that the company has liquidity problems and that the company is not paying its suppliers in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="indent">A decline in the payable period could be an indication of change in credit terms or an indication that the company has issues with its cash management. This number can be compared to the industry average, to other companies, or trended over time to see how a company is doing with payables.

<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-065.jpg" alt="image" width="302" height="69"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>debt to equity</i> measures how much of the company is financed by its debt holders compared with its owners and is another measure of financial health. A company with a large amount of debt will have a very high debt to equity ratio, whereas one with little debt will have a low debt to equity ratio. Companies with lower debt to equity ratios are generally less risky than those with higher debt to equity ratios.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has total liabilities in the amount of $51,430 and equity in the amount of $52,070. This gives a debt to equity ratio of 0.98.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-066.jpg" alt="image" width="300" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">A debt to equity ratio of 0.98 is not uncommon. However, there is no specific optimal capital structure for a company. What is optimal for one company might not be right for another. There needs to be a balance between debt and equity financing. Debt financing typically offers the lowest rate. However, too much debt financing is rarely the optimal structure, as debt has to be paid back even when the company is going through troubled times.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>dividend payout ratio</i> shows the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends and how well earnings support the dividend payments. More mature companies tend to have a higher payout ratio compared to growth companies. This is because growth companies can provide a higher return on investment by using the cash (dividend) to invest in the growth of the company.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has a dividend per share in the amount of $0.30 and earnings per share in the amount of $0.95. This gives a dividend payout ratio of 31.57%, which means that ABC Company paid 31.57% of its net income to its shareholders in form of dividend.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-068.jpg" alt="image" width="358" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent">Dividend payout ratio can also be calculated as dividends divided by net income. In this example, using the data from ABC Company, it would have been 3,000 / 9,475 = 31.57%.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>dividend per share</i> ratio measures the profit distribution paid out on a per share basis to the company’s shareholders. Most companies have a dividend payout policy; however, not all companies pay out an annual dividend. Growth companies would typically not pay out any dividend early on, whereas more mature companies typically pay out dividends. This is because growth companies can provide a higher return on investment, by using the cash (dividend) to invest in the growth of the company.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has paid out dividend in the amount of $3,000 based on a total number of outstanding shares of 10.000. This gives a dividend per share of 0.30 dollars.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-070.jpg" alt="image" width="329" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">A company with a year over year growth in the dividend per share is a positive sign that the company believes that the growth can be sustained. The growth in the dividend payout will also reflect positively on the company’s share price.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>dividend yield,</i> also known as current yield, is a measure of an investment’s return. The higher the dividend yield, the higher the return on the investment.</p>
<p class="indent">Typically, only profitable companies pay out dividends; therefore, investors often view companies that have paid out significant dividends for an extended period of time as a less risky investment.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has paid out dividend per share in the amount of $0.30 and has a share price at the end of the year in the amount of $6.15 per share. This gives a dividend yield in the amount of 4.87%, which means that the investor has earned 4.87% return if he has paid $6.15 for each share purchased.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-072.jpg" alt="image" width="285" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent">The term yield is often used in different situations to mean different things. Because of this, yields from different investments should not necessarily be compared as if they were all equal.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>DuPont ratio</i> is an expression that breaks return on equity (ROE) into its three components to give a total picture of how the company is performing. In the DuPont formula, ROE is defined as profit margin multiplied by total asset turnover and the equity multiplier. When someone says “DuPont ratio” and you instantly think “margin-turn-leverage,” you are doing pretty well. What is important are the components, not necessarily the final number. Two companies might have the exact same ROE, but their components could be very different, showing you different business strategies.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>earnings per share</i> ratio shows the portion of a company’s profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. Earnings per share serve as an indicator of a company’s profitability.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">In 2013, ABC Company had net income in the amount of $9,475 and total number of outstanding shares of 10,000. This gives earnings per share of $0.95, which means that the company generates net income of $0.95 for each outstanding share.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-090.jpg" alt="image" width="219" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">Generally, the higher the earnings per share the better a company is doing for the shareholders. An increase in EPS year over year is typically a sign of a growth or a mature company. Some companies buy back shares to improve earnings per share without necessarily increasing net income.

<p class="indent">The <i>economic value added</i> measures a company’s true profitability. That is, its ability to generate returns in excess of the return required by investors.

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>effective tax rate</i> explains the various rates at which a company’s income is taxed as a result of different tax jurisdictions both domestically and internationally. Companies also employ strategies to minimize tax. To compute the effective (or average for the year) tax rate, total tax expense is divided by earnings before tax.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has total tax expenses for the year in the amount of $2,970 and earnings before tax in the amount of $12,445. This gives an effective tax rate of 23.86%.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-094.jpg" alt="image" width="340" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">This number can be compared to other companies’ effective tax rates to evaluate the tax strategies of the company. If, for example, you were Coke and you saw that Pepsi had a lower effective tax rate, you would want to do a deeper dive and find out why.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="indent">Companies with significant lower than average tax rate compared to other companies in its industry might be very aggressive on their tax strategies.

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>enterprise value</i> is a measure of a company’s value as a functioning entity, often used as an alternative to straightforward market capitalization. If you were to purchase (buy out) a firm, you would start with its enterprise value and work from there to determine your offer. Thus, you can see why cash is subtracted because you would get that cash in the deal to offset what you are buying, debt and equity.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has a market cap of $61,500, debt in the amount of $22,005, and cash and cash equivalents amounting to $16,450. The company does not have any minority interest or any preferred shares. This gives an enterprise value of $67,055.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-096.jpg" alt="image" width="450" height="33"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="indent">Calculating the enterprise value for public companies are relatively easy as the market cap—that is, the number of shares times the company’s share price—is publicly available. Calculating the enterprise value for private companies are for the same reason not that easy as there is no public market for the company’s stock. A common approach to valuing equity of a private company is to compare the entity to similar companies, that is, industry, debt structure, results, and growth opportunities, which are public traded.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>equity multiplier,</i> also known as assets to equity ratio, gives a sense of how much of the total assets of a company are really owned by shareholders as compared to those that are financed by debt. Some businesses thrive more on borrowing money (leverage) than other companies. High assets to equity may be good for them. However, there is always some point for any company for which their assets are overleveraged. That can be dangerous to the shareholders and their equity (e.g., Lehman Brothers was so overleveraged in 2007 that their assets to equity was 31! Calls on their debt in 2008 more than wiped out the shareholders).</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has total assets in the amount of $132,000 and shareholder equity in the amount of $52,070. This gives an equity multiplier of 2.54. Thus, the business has $2.54 of assets for every dollar of shareholder equity.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>exercise value</i> is the value of an option if it is exercised today. For a call option, this is the difference between the current stock price and the strike price. The strike price, also known as the exercise price, is the current market value price.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>fixed assets turnover</i> measures how effectively the company uses its assets to generate sales. The higher the ratio, the better the company is at generating sales from its assets.</p>
<p class="indent">The fixed assets typically include property, plant, and equipment. Other assets such as goodwill, deferred taxes, and other nonproperty, plant, and equipment items are typically excluded to provide a more meaningful and comparative ratio. In most cases, these assets are not directly involved in generating sales and are therefore excluded.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and total fixed assets in the amount of $32,620, which gives a fixed asset turnover ratio of 6.44. This means that for each dollar invested in fixed assets the company is generating $6.44 of sales.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-102.jpg" alt="image" width="379" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">Fixed asset turnover varies significantly from industry to industry. For example, a manufacturing company will have a much lower fixed asset turnover compared to a service company with little to no assets. It is therefore important to compare the ratio with comparable companies. A sudden decline in the fixed asset turnover ratio could be an indication that that the company has recently invested significantly in fixed assets. A decline could also indicate that the company has sold fixed assets or fully depreciated assets without acquiring new assets.</p>

A company with a large amount of debt will have a very gearing ratio, whereas one with little debt will have a low gearing ratio. Companies with lower gearing ratios are generally less risky than those with higher gearing ratios.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has total liabilities in the amount of $51,430 and equity in the amount of $52,070 this give a debt to equity ratio of 0.98.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-106.jpg" alt="image" width="238" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">A Gearing ratio of 0.98 is not uncommon. However, there is no specific optimal capital structure for a company. There needs to be a balance between debt (including short- and long-term debt) and equity financing. Debt financing typically offers the lowest rate because of its tax deductibility. However, too much debt financing is rarely the optimal structure as debt has to be paid back even when the company is going through troubled times.</p>

<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-107.jpg" alt="image" width="608" height="69"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>Gordon constant growth model</i> shows the intrinsic value of a stock based on future dividends at a constant growth rate. The model is mainly used to determine the intrinsic value of mature companies because of the constant growth rate component.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">Let’s assume that ABC Company expects the growth rate in dividends to be 5% in perpetuity. The dividend per share in 2013 was $0.30. This means that the expected dividend per share for 2014 will be $0.315.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-108.jpg" alt="image" width="310" height="71"/></p>
<p class="indent">If we further assume that the investors required rate of return is 8%, then the intrinsic value of the stock would be $10.50. Compared to the current stock price of $6.15, this would make it a good stock in which to invest.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-109.jpg" alt="image" width="460" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>gross profit margin</i> measures how much gross profit is generated for each dollar of sales. The gross profit has to cover the company’s operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, finance cost, and taxes.</p>
<p class="indent">Gross profit margin will vary significantly between companies in different industries. For example, companies with significant fixed assets will typically have a higher gross profit margin than companies with low fixed assets such as service companies.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and cost of sales in the amount of $163,000, which gives a gross profit margin of 22.38%. A gross profit margin of 22.38% means that for each $100 of sales generated by the company, $22.38 is gross profit to cover the company’s operating costs.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-110.jpg" alt="image" width="477" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">A change in the company’s gross profit margin could be a result of price pressure from competitors, meaning that the company maintains the current cost structure while lowering sales prices. It could also be a result of higher cost of sales. This could be true if goods are imported, which typically adds another layer of expenses to the cost of sales, that is, fluctuations in foreign currents. Often, it can also be explained with a shift in product mix. It is therefore important to look at the gross profit margin on each product or product line.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>horizon value,</i> also known as the terminal value, shows the value of future operations beyond the end of the forecast period. It is calculated as the present value of all future cash flows after the forecast period.</p>
<p class="indent">That is the period when the company expects a constant growth rate in perpetuity. Horizon value is often used in valuation models for the period beyond which you don’t have specific financial data but expect the company to grow at some constant rate.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has free cash flow in the amount of $5,360, WACC in the amount of 8.4%, and an assumed constant growth rate of 3%. This gives a horizon value in the amount of $102,237.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>interest coverage,</i> also known as times interest earned (TIE), indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on its outstanding debt and to what extent operating income can decline before the company is unable to meet its annual interest expenses.</p>
<p class="indent">The lower the ratio, the higher the likelihood that the company will not be able to service its debt (pay interest expenses on its debt). If the interest coverage ratio gets below 1, the company is not generating enough earnings to service its debt.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the amount of $13,525 and interest expenses in the amount of $1,190. This gives an interest coverage ratio in the amount of 11.37, which means that the company has earnings more than 11 times its interest expense.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-114.jpg" alt="image" width="323" height="65"/></p>

<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has inventory in the amount of $28,875 and cost of sales in the amount of $163,000. This gives an inventory conversion period of 55.70 days.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-116.jpg" alt="image" width="540" height="69"/></p>
<p class="indent">This means that ABC Company holds its inventory for an average of 55.70 days before their products are sold to customers. This number can be compared to the industry average, to other companies, or trended over time to see how a company is doing managing inventory.</p>
<p class="indent">The lower the inventory conversation period, the better position for the company from a cash management perspective as inventory is converted faster.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>inventory turnover</i> shows how many times a company’s inventory is sold and replaced over a given period. Inventory turnover for a period can also be calculated as cost of goods sold over ending inventory for that period.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and inventory in the amount of $24,875; this gives an inventory turnover ratio of 8.44.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>market capitalization</i> (market cap), also known as market value of equity, is the total market value of all of a company’s outstanding shares.

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>market to book ratio,</i> also known as price to book ratio, measures the relative value of a company compared to its share price. The ratio can also be calculated as total market value over total book value as the “per share” part of the equation cancels out.</p>
<p class="indent">Market to book ratio is a great tool to quickly determine whether a company is under or overvalued. If the company has a low market to book ratio, it is most likely undervalued and could be considered a good investment opportunity.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has a share price of $6.15 at the end of the year and a book value per share of $5.20 also at the end of the year. This gives a market to book ratio of 1.18.

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>market to debt ratio</i> is used to determine the financial strength of a company or to compare to other companies in a similar industry.

<p class="indent">The <i>operating profit margin</i> is a measurement of what proportion of a company’s revenue is left over after paying for variable costs of production such as wages, raw materials, and so on. A healthy operating margin is required for a company to be able to cover other costs such as depreciation, interest expenses, profit to shareholders, and profit to invest in the growth of the company. Another way to look at it is that operating profit margin tells you how good the company is at generating profits from its core business, as opposed to all other aspects of the company.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the amount of $13,525 and sales in the amount of $210,000. This gives an operating profit margin of 6.44%.</p>

<p class="indent">Payable period ratio of 41.33 means that the company pays its suppliers 41.33 days after receiving the products.

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>pre-money</i> (and post-money) <i>valuation</i> are frequently used terms to describe the valuation of a company when raising capital. When a private equity firm, venture capitalist, or angel investor injects cash into a company in exchange for equity (ownership), the company’s value immediately before the investment is called pre-money valuation, whereas the company’s value immediately after the transaction is called post-money valuation.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">If a venture capital (VC) firm invests $10,000,000 for 25% equity in the company, then the post-money valuation would be equal to $40,000,000.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-151.jpg" alt="image" width="292" height="69"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>price earnings ratio</i> values the company’s current share price compared to its per-share earnings. P/E ratios are one method for determining how “expensive” or “cheap” a stock is. When you are buying stock in a company, you are really buying the future earnings of that company. By dividing the price by the earnings gives you some sense of the value of the stock in comparable terms.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has a price per share in the amount of $6.15 and earnings per share in the amount of $9.48. This gives a P/E ratio of $6.49.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-152.jpg" alt="image" width="227" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent">This number can be compared to other companies in a similar industry. If one company has a substantially different P/E ratio than another, one can dig into details to find out if there is a reason for it. In some cases, the market has incorrectly valued a stock, offering the investor an arbitrage opportunity.</p>

<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-153.jpg" alt="image" width="371" height="69"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>price to book</i> ratio, also known as market to book ratio, measures the relative value of a company compared to its share price. The ratio can also be calculated as total market value over total book value as the per share part in the equation washes out.</p>
<p class="indent">Price to book ratio is a great tool to quickly determine whether a company is under or overvalued. If the company has a low price to book ratio, it is undervalued and considered a good investment opportunity.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has a share price of $6.15 at the end of the year and a book value per share of $5.20 also at the end of the year. This gives a price to book ratio of 1.18. This means that the company is overvalued and that the investors are willing to pay a premium to purchase the shares. A price to book ratio of less than 1 indicates that the company is undervalued.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>price to cash flow ratio</i> shows the company’s ability to generate cash and acts as an indicator of liquidity and solvency. Because accounting rules are different country by country, reported earnings and, therefore, price to earnings ratios, may not make a true comparison. Using cash flow per share is one method to strip away these differences.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has a price per share in the amount of $6.15 and cash flow per share in the amount of $0.81. This gives a price to cash flow ratio of $7.55.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>price to sale ratio</i> is a market value measure, typically used in the valuation of shares. Price to sale ratio is calculated as price per share divided by revenue per share.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has a price per share at the end of the year in the amount of $6.10 and revenue per share in the amount of $21.00. This gives a price to sale ratio of 29.28%.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-158.jpg" alt="image" width="285" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent">Price to sale ratio can also be calculated as market capitalization divided by total sales.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-159.jpg" alt="image" width="448" height="71"/></p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>profit margin</i> also known as net profit margin, measures how much of every dollar of sales a company keeps in earnings.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has net income in the amount of 9,475 and sales in the amount of 210,000. This gives a profit margin of 4.51%.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-161.jpg" alt="image" width="302" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">A profit margin of 4.50% means that the company earns $4.5 for every $100 of sales. A declining profit margin can be an indication of price pressure from competitors, higher cost of sales, change in product mix, or higher operating cost.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="indent">A decline in the company’s profit margin can in some cases in a mature market represent a price war, which is lowering profits. A decline in profit margins can also be a pricing strategy in order for the company to increase its market share.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>quick ratio</i> shows whether a company has enough short-term assets to cover its immediate liabilities without selling inventory. The higher the quick ratio, the safer a position the company is in.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has currents assets in the amount of $69,765, inventory in the amount of $24,875, and current liabilities in the amount of $28,500. This gives a quick ratio of 1.58, which indicates that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities more than one and a half times over without selling inventory.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-163.jpg" alt="image" width="348" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">The quick ratio is very similar to the current ratio except that it excludes inventory because inventory is often illiquid. The nature of the inventory will determine if the acid test or the current ratio is more applicable to your situation.</p>

<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-164.jpg" alt="image" width="321" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>receivable turnover</i> measures the number of times receivables are converted into cash in a given period. This is different from the average collection period which shows the number of days it takes to collect the receivables.</p>
<p class="indent">Ideally, credit sales should be used in the numerator and average receivables in the denominator. However, these figures are often not readily available in the financial statements.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and receivable in the amount of $28,030. This gives a receivable turnover ratio of 7.49. The higher the receivable turnover ratio is, the better the company is at converting receivables into cash. A decline in the turnover ratio could mean either a decline in sales or an indication that the customers are taking a longer time to pay for their purchases.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-165.jpg" alt="image" width="358" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">The company can improve the turnover ratio by many methods. The most popular approach is offering a discount to the customers that pay their outstanding balance earlier, for example, within 30 days of the sales.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="indent">Receivable turnover is also known as the accounts receivable turnover.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>receivable collection period</i> indicates the amount of time (in days) it takes a company to convert its receivables into cash.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has accounts receivable in the amount of $28,030 and credit sales in the amount of $210,000. (In this example, credit sales and total sales are identical.) This gives a receivable collection period of 48.72 days, which means that it takes a little over one and a half month for the company to convert credit sales into cash.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-167.jpg" alt="image" width="531" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">The company’s credit terms will have a significant impact on the average collection period. The better the credit terms, the higher the average collection period. An increase in the receivable collection period could indicate increased risk of the company’s customers not being able to pay for their purchases. A possible result is that the company will have to reserve for potential losses or expense bad debt. Most large companies (nonretail) do not handle many cash sales. Therefore, when looking at financial statements, it can be assumed that total sales do not include any cash sales. However, in smaller companies and in retail businesses, cash sales can be a significant part of the total sales.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="indent">The receivable collection period is also known as the average collection period or simply collection period.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>return on equity</i> is the amount of net income generated as a percentage of shareholders equity. If the whole concept of business in general is dominated by the idea that you can take some money and turn it into more money, then return on equity is the king of all ratios. ROE measures the company’s profitability by how much profit is generated with the money shareholders have invested.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has net income in the amount of $9,475 and shareholders’ equity in the amount of $52,070. This gives a return on equity (ROE) of 18.19%, which means that for every $100 of equity the company generates $18.19 of net income.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-169.jpg" alt="image" width="342" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">ROE is a valuable number both on its own and compared to other companies. Ideally, you will invest in companies with the highest ROE. All companies strive to make ROE higher.

<p class="indent">The <i>terminal value,</i> also known as the horizon value, shows the value of future operations beyond the end of the forecast period. It is calculated as the present value of all future cash flows after the forecast period, which is the period in which the company expects a constant growth rate in perpetuity. Terminal value is often used in valuation models for the period beyond which you don’t have specific financial data but expect the company to grow at some constant rate.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has free cash flow in the amount of $5,360, WACC in the amount of 8.4%, and an assumed constant growth rate of 3%. This gives a terminal value in the amount of $102,237.</p>

<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-192.jpg" alt="image" width="392" height="69"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>times interest earned,</i> also known as interest coverage, measures a company’s ability to pay interest on its outstanding debt and to what extent operating income can decline before the company is unable to meet its annual interest expenses.</p>
<p class="indent">The lower the ratio, the higher the likelihood that the company will not be able to service its debt (pay interest expenses on its debt). If the TIE ratio goes below 1, the company is not generating enough earnings to service its debt.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the amount of $13,525 and interest expenses in the amount of $1,190. This gives a TIE ratio in the amount of 11.37, which means that the company has earnings more than 11 times its interest expense.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-193.jpg" alt="image" width="365" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">A TIE ratio of 11.37 provides sufficient coverage that the company will be able to service its debt.</p>

<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-194.jpg" alt="image" width="342" height="69"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>total assets turnover</i> ratio measures the sales generated per dollar of assets and is an indication of how efficient the company is in utilizing their assets to generate sales.</p>
<p class="indent">Asset-intensive companies such as mining, manufacturing, and so on will generally have lower asset turnover ratios compared to companies that have fewer assets such as consulting and service companies.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has sales in the amount of $210,000 and total assets in the amount of $132,000. This gives a total asset turnover ratio of 1.59.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-195.jpg" alt="image" width="358" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">This means that for every dollar invested in assets the company generates $1.59 of sales. This number should be compared to the industry average for companies in the same industry.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">WACC means <i>weighted average cost of capital,</i> also known as cost of capital, and measures the company’s average costs of financing. Most companies are financed by both debt and equity.</p>
<p class="indent">WACC measures the weighted average cost of these two sources of capital. This rate is most often used in capital allocation for evaluating future projects. In general, all projects that the company takes on should yield a return greater that the weighted average cost of capital.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has total debt in the amount of $79,930. The weight of the company’s financing is 61% debt and 39% equity, the rate of which is financed with 7% and 13%, respectively. The company’s effective tax rate is 22%. Tax rate used in the calculation should be the company’s effective tax rate and not the statutory rate.</p>
<p class="indent">This gives a weighted average cost of capital in the amount of 8.40%. Projects that are not expected to return greater than 8.40% would generally be declined unless they show some other noneconomic benefit to the company.</p>

<p id="Sec97" class="Heading1">Working capital ratio<a id="cXXX.113"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Type:</b> Performance measure</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Formula</b></p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-200.jpg" alt="image" width="392" height="63"/></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="indent">The <i>working capital</i> is the capital that a company has for day-to-day operations. The working capital ratio indicates whether the company has enough short-term assets (current assets) to cover its short-term liabilities (current liabilities) and thus leave the company with “working capital” to support its current operations. A ratio below 1 is an indication of negative working capital, meaning that the company will most likely not be able to cover its current short-term obligations.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="indent">ABC Company has current assets in the amount of $67,765 and current liabilities in the amount of $28,500. This provides the company with a working capital ratio in the amount of $41,265 and a working capital ratio of 2.44.</p>
<p class="img-c"><img src="images/Eqn2-201.jpg" alt="image" width="358" height="65"/></p>
<p class="indent">This means that the company can cover its short-term liabilities almost 2.5 times with its short-term assets. Companies may have a hurdle working capital ratio they need to meet in order to get funding from lenders.</p>
<p class="img-c">Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.</p>
<p class="img-c">Working capital = Current assets – Current liabilities</p>
<p class="img-c">Working capital = 69,765 – 28,500 = 41,265</p></div></div>
