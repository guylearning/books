<p class="para"><a id="page_1"></a><span class="dropcap">T</span>his is a book for businesspeople. All decisions in a business organization are made in accordance with how they will affect the organization’s financial performance and future financial health. Whether your background is in marketing, manufacturing, distribution, research and development, or the current technologies, you need financial knowledge and skills if you are to really understand your company’s decision-making, financial, and overall management processes. The budget is essentially a financial process of prioritizing the benefits resulting from business opportunities and the investments required to implement those opportunities. An improved knowledge of these financial processes and the financial executives who are responsible for them will improve your ability to be an intelligent and effective participant.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The American economy has experienced incredible turmoil in the years since this book was first published. Before U.S. government intervention in 2008/2009, we were on the verge of our second “great depression.” We witnessed the demise of three great financial firms, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG. Corporate bankruptcies were rampant, with General Motors, Chrysler, and most of the major airlines filing. The U.S. government lent the banks hundreds of billions of dollars to save the financial system, while approximately seven million Americans lost their jobs (and most of these jobs will never exist again; see <a href="chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>, “Key Financial Ratios,” for a discussion of employee productivity trends). <a id="page_2"></a>The cumulative value of real estate in this country declined by 40 percent; combining this with the 50 percent drop in the stock market, millions of Americans lost at least half of their net worth. Accounting scandals caused the downfall of many companies, the demise of some major CPA firms, and jail time for some of the principals involved. (Enron would not have happened had its CPA firm done the audit job properly. Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme could not have been maintained had his CPA firm not been complicit.) More than ever, business and organization managers require a knowledge of finance and accounting as a prerequisite to professional advancement. It is for this reason that the second edition included additional accounting and regulatory compliance information and introduced the stronger analytical skills that are necessary to navigate the global economic turmoil.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The depth of the 2008 recession intensified competitive pressures as companies struggled to survive and regain their financial health and profitability. As important and valuable as financial knowledge was prior to the crisis (and the writing of the second edition of this book), it is even more so now.</p>
<p class="para-ind">This book distinguishes itself from similar finance and accounting books in many ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>It teaches what accountants do; it does <em>not</em> teach how to do accounting. Businesspeople do not need to learn, nor are they interested in learning, how to do debits and credits. They do need to understand what accountants do and why, so that they can use the resulting information—the financial statements—intelligently.</li>
<li>It is written by a businessperson for other businesspeople. Throughout a lifetime of business, consulting, and training experience, I have provided my audiences with down-to-earth, practical, useful information. I am not an accountant, but I do have the knowledge of an intelligent user of financial information and tools. I understand your problems, and I seek to share my knowledge with you.</li>
<li>It emphasizes the business issues. Many financial books focus on the mathematics. This book employs mathematical <a id="page_3"></a>information only when it is needed to support the business decision-making process.</li>
<li>It includes a chapter on how to read an annual report. This helps you to use the information that is available there, including the information required by Sarbanes-Oxley, to better understand your own company. Sarbanes-Oxley is legislation passed by Congress and enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The governance information required by this act is highlighted and explained, and its impact is analyzed. This chapter also identifies a number of sources of information about your competition that are in the public domain and that may be of great strategic value.</li>
<li>It includes a great deal of information on how the finance department contributes to the profitability and performance of the company. The financial staff should be part of the business profitability team. This book describes what you should expect from them.</li>
<li>It contains many practical examples of how the information can be used, based upon extensive practical experience. It also provides a number of exercises, including several case studies, as appendices.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rintr_sub1"></a>Organization of the Book</h3>
<p class="para">This book is organized in four parts, which are followed by Appendices A through F and the Glossary.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Part 1: <strong>“</strong>Understanding Financial Information,” Chapters 1 through 5</h4>
<p class="para">In <a href="part01.html">Part 1</a>, the reader is given both an overview and detailed information about each of the financial statements and its components. A complete understanding of this information and how it is developed is essential for intelligent use of the financial statements.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Each statement is described, item by item. The discussion explains where the numbers belong and what they mean. The entire <a id="page_4"></a>structure of each financial statement is described, so that you will be able to understand how the financial statements interrelate with each other and what information each of them conveys. The financial statements that are discussed in <a href="part01.html">Part 1</a> are:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>The balance sheet</li>
<li>The income statement</li>
<li>The statement of cash flows</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind"><a href="part01.html">Part 1</a> also contains a chapter on how to read and understand an annual report. The benefits of doing so are numerous. They include:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Understanding the reporting responsibilities of a public company</li>
<li>Further understanding the accounting process</li>
<li>Identifying and using information about competitors that is in the public domain</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">Managers are always asking for more information about what they should look for as they read the financial statements. In response to this need, the second edition of this book included greatly expanded Chapters <a href="chapter01.html">1</a>, <a href="chapter02.html">2</a>, and <a href="chapter03.html">3</a>, along with a line-by-line explanation of each component of the financial statement; these chapters also include a preliminary analysis of the story that the numbers are telling. For most of the numbers, the book answers the questions: “What business conclusions can I reach by reading these financial statements?” and “What are the key ‘red flags’ that should jump out at me?”</p>
<p class="para-ind">Each of these red flags is identified. Questions that you should ask the financial staff are included, and the key issues and action items that need to be addressed are discussed.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Chapters <a href="chapter04.html">4</a> and <a href="chapter05.html">5</a> introduce the reader to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and invaluable corporate documents, such as the annual report.</p>
<h4 class="h4a"><a id="page_5"></a>Part 2: <strong>“</strong>Analysis of Financial Statements,<strong>”</strong> Chapters 6 through 8</h4>
<p class="para"><a href="part02.html">Part 2</a> focuses on the many valuable analyses that can be performed using the information that was learned in <a href="part01.html">Part 1</a>. Business management activities can essentially be divided into two basic categories:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Measuring performance</li>
<li>Making decisions</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">Chapters <a href="chapter06.html">6</a> through <a href="chapter08.html">8</a> explain how to measure and evaluate the performance of the company, its strategic business units, and even its individual products.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Financial ratios and statistical metrics are very dynamic tools. This section includes analyses that will help the businessperson survive in our more complex economic environment. Technology has changed the way we do business. This section includes discussions of the customer interface, supply-chain management, global sourcing, and financial measurement and controls.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Now that we have learned how to read and understand financial statements, we also understand how they are prepared and what they mean. <a href="part02.html">Part 2</a> identifies management tools that help us use the information in financial statements to analyze the company’s performance. The ratios that will be covered describe the company’s:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Liquidity</li>
<li>Working capital management</li>
<li>Financial leverage (debt)</li>
<li>Profitability and performance</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">Financial turmoil from 2007 to 2010 has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs in the United States. Since 2010, millions of jobs have been added as our economy recovered. Most of these jobs, however, did not return in their previous form. Companies are <a id="page_6"></a>focusing on measuring how much business revenue they can achieve with a minimal increase in the number of employees. Technology, the ease of global sourcing and trade, and the pressures on improving financial performance have made intelligent financial analysis of the business an absolute necessity—and one capable of bringing great rewards.</p>
<p class="para-ind">In this regard, with the support of technology and improving business models, revenue per employee, discussed in <a href="chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>, has become a key metric of a company’s effectiveness and its ability to compete and achieve. At the end of <a href="chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>, we have included a brief analysis which we call a “quick and dirty” financial review. This imitates a not-so-hypothetical situation—you have 10 minutes to review a set of financials (the buzz phrase that the in-group refers to when referring to the three financial statements) prior to a meeting, perhaps when time is limited or you just want a summary story of the information. The question is—What can you look at in the financials to get a quick sense of the company?</p>
<p class="para-ind"><a href="chapter07.html">Chapter 7</a> amplifies the formulas and processes specific to return on assets, and <a href="chapter08.html">Chapter 8</a> includes a discussion of overhead allocation, which also impacts financial analysis.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Part 3, <strong>“</strong>Decision Making for Improved Profitability,<strong>”</strong> Chapters 9 and 10</h4>
<p class="para"><a href="part03.html">Part 3</a> discusses the key financial analysis techniques that managers can use to make decisions about every aspect of their business. Financial analysis provides valuable tools for decision making. Financial analysis of a proposed business decision requires disciplined forecasting. It requires that management quantify all of the impacts that a proposed decision will have on the profitability and financial health of their company. A careful, thoughtful, and thorough financial analysis/forecast provides assurance that all of the issues have been considered. Managers can then make their decisions based upon their forecast.</p>
<p class="para-ind"><a href="part03.html">Part 3</a> also explores and analyzes fixed-cost versus variable-cost issues within the context of strategic planning. These include:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li><a id="page_7"></a>Supply-chain management</li>
<li>New product strategy</li>
<li>Marketing strategy</li>
<li>Product mix and growth strategies</li>
<li>Outsourcing options</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">Measuring the performance of profit centers is no longer a growing trend. It is now a necessary business practice. This is also true of investment decision making based upon cash flow forecasting techniques. The financial benefits of success are too valuable and the financial penalties for failure too severe for companies to make decisions without first extensively examining the cash flow issues involved in each proposal. <a href="part03.html">Part 3</a> explains the technique called <em>discounted cash flow</em>. To determine the cash flow impact of proposed investment decisions, there are several measures using this technique:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Internal rate of return</li>
<li>Net present value</li>
<li>Profitability index</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">The types of investments that are covered in this discussion are:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Capital expenditures</li>
<li>Research and development</li>
<li>Acquiring other companies</li>
<li>Marketing programs</li>
<li>Strategic alliances</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4a">Part 4: <strong>“</strong>Additional Financial Information,<strong>”</strong> Chapters 11 through 13</h4>
<p class="para"><a href="part04.html">Part 4</a> describes in considerable detail some additional financial information that will benefit the businessperson. It includes discussions of <a id="page_8"></a>the planning process and the budget, and why they are so important. It also covers the many ways in which the company may obtain financing. While this is not a direct responsibility of most members of the management team, knowledge of debt and equity markets and sources of corporate financing will be very useful for the business manager.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Appendices A Through F</h4>
<p class="para">In order to ensure that you have understood the information provided in this book, we have included six practice exercises in the appendices. One of the goals of this book is to make the information it provides really useful in your business management efforts. An effective way to achieve this is to practice the lessons and analyses.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Appendix A provides practice in constructing the three financial statements. This “fill in the blanks” exercise will reinforce the knowledge gained in <a href="part01.html">Part 1</a>.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Appendix B is a glossary “matching” test. Seventy-nine financial terms are given, along with their definitions, but not in the same sequence. This will reinforce understanding of the many terms and “buzzwords” that businesspeople must understand when they communicate with accounting people and use the information that they produce.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Appendix C is a comprehensive case study of a company that is (in a financial sense) severely underachieving. The company’s past performance must be analyzed using the knowledge gained in <a href="chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>, “Key Financial Ratios.” The case study also includes the budget plan and forecasting techniques discussed in Chapters <a href="chapter10.html">10</a> and <a href="chapter12.html">12</a>.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The format and content of financial information is seriously affected by the business the company is in. Thus, Appendix D provides a list of 10 companies and 10 sets of financial information. The goal is to figure out which set of financial information belongs to which of the 10 companies. Providing actual, recognizable companies provides the opportunity to understand how ratios behave <a id="page_9"></a>and is another step forward in making the financial information really useful.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Appendix E is a case study that demonstrates a return on investment analysis using the concept of <em>discounted cash flow</em>, which is described fully in <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>. The financial forecasting technique is very valuable and is applicable to many business situations, especially when they have strategic implications and/or involve significant financial risk.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Appendix F is a case study that provides practice in analyzing the opportunity to outsource production rather than accomplish it internally. The fixed cost/variable cost supply-chain issue is described in <a href="chapter09.html">Chapter 9</a>.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Answers are provided for all of the appendices, but please give the exercises a try before you peek.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rintr_sub2"></a>Additional Background</h3>
<p class="para">We study financial management because doing so helps us to manage our business more intelligently.</p>
<p class="para-ind">As mentioned earlier, business management activities may be divided into two major categories:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Measuring performance</li>
<li>Making decisions</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">We measure the performance of products and markets in order to understand the profitability of the business. Financial knowledge concerning our company’s products, markets, and customers enables us to make decisions that will improve its profitability.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The <em>income statement</em> measures the performance of the business for a period of time, whether it be a year, a quarter, or a month. It enables us to determine trends and identify strengths and weaknesses in the company’s performance.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The <em>balance sheet</em> measures the financial health of the business at a point in time, usually at the end of a month, a quarter, or a <a id="page_10"></a>year. Can the company afford to finance its future growth and pay off its debts?</p>
<p class="para-ind"><em>Breakeven analysis</em> helps us to understand the profitability of individual products. We use it to evaluate pricing strategies and costs. The company uses the results of this analysis in decisions concerning such things as outsourcing options, vertical integration, and strategic alliances.</p>
<p class="para-ind">This book surveys these financial tools. We will provide descriptions and definitions of their components so that you can gain an understanding of how they can help you and why you should understand them.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rintr_sub3"></a>Accounting Defined</h3>
<p class="para">Accounting is the process of recording past business transactions in dollars (or any other currency). Training to become a certified public accountant (CPA) involves learning the rules and regulations of the following organizations:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li><em>The Securities and Exchange Commission.</em> This is an agency of the federal government that, among other responsibilities, prescribes the methodology for reporting accounting results for companies whose stock is publicly traded. Most private companies adhere to most of these rules, except for the requirement that they publish the information.</li>
<li><em>The Internal Revenue Service</em>. This agency oversees the filing of all corporate tax returns consistent with the tax legislation passed by the U.S. Congress.</li>
<li><em>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</em> This executive branch federal agency prescribes the reporting and accounting systems used by commercial banks.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">Two private accounting organizations are integral to the accounting profession:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li><em>The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)</em>. This is a research organization that evaluates, develops, and recommends <a id="page_11"></a>the rules that accountants should follow when they audit the books of a company and report the results to shareholders. The products of its efforts are reports known as FASB Bulletins.</li>
<li><em>The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.</em> This is the accountants’ professional organization (trade association). It is an active participant in the accounting dialogue.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">The work of all of these organizations and the dialogue among them, along with the work of the tax-writing committees of the U.S. Congress, results in what are known as <em>generally accepted accounting principles.</em></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rintr_sub4"></a>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</h3>
<p class="para">The concept of ‘generally accepted accounting principles’ (GAAP) makes an invaluable contribution to the way in which business is conducted. When a CPA firm certifies a company’s financial statements, it is assuring the users of those statements that the company adhered to these rules and prepared its financial statements accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Why Is GAAP Important?</h4>
<p class="para">The use and certification of GAAP provides comfort and credibility. The reader of the reported financial statements is typically not familiar with the inner workings of the company. GAAP gives a company’s stockholders, bankers, regulators, potential business partners, customers, and vendors some assurance that the information provided in the company’s annual report is accurate and reliable. It facilitates almost all business dealings.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Why Is GAAP an Issue for the Business Manager?</h4>
<p class="para">While accounting principles and practices are critical for the presentation of past history, their mechanics, requirements, and philosophies are not necessarily appropriate for the business manager <a id="page_12"></a>who is seeking to analyze the business going forward. To understand this issue, we need to define financial analysis.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rintr_sub5"></a>Financial Analysis</h3>
<p class="para">Financial analysis is an analytical process. It is an effort to examine past events and to understand the business circumstances, both internal and external, that caused those events to occur. Knowing and understanding the accounting information is certainly a critical part of this process. But to fully understand the company’s past performance, it is important to also have information concerning units sold, market share, orders on the books, utilization of productive capacity, the efficiency of the supply chain, and much more. Every month, we compare the actual performance with the budget. This is <em>not</em> an accounting process. It is an analytical process that uses accounting information.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Accounting is the reporting of the past. The budget reflects management’s expectations for future events and offers a standard of performance for revenues, expenses, and profits.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Financial analysis as a high-priority management process also requires forecasting. A <em>forecast</em> is an educated perception of how a decision that is being contemplated will affect the future of the business. It requires a financial forecast—a financial quantification of the anticipated effect of the decision on marketing and operational events, and therefore on cash flow.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Accounting/Forecasting/Budget Perspective</h4>
<p class="para">The end result of all the planning efforts in which a company engages, including forecasting, must finally be the making of decisions. These many decisions about people, spending allocations, products, and markets are included in a report called a <em>budget.</em> Therefore, the budget is really a documentation of all the decisions that management has already made.</p>
<h4 class="h4a"><a id="page_13"></a>The Issues</h4>
<p class="para">There are frequently cultural clashes between the accounting department and the rest of the company. This results from the false assumption that the philosophies and attitudes that are required for accounting are also appropriate in business analysis and decision making. The budget is not an accounting effort. It is a management process that may be coordinated by people with accounting backgrounds. A forecast need not adhere to accounting rules. There is nothing in accounting training that teaches accountants to deal with marketing and operational forecasting and decision-making issues. In addition, to the extent that the future may not be an extension of the past, it is conceivable that past (accounting) events may not be very relevant.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Accounting is somewhat precise. Forecasting, by its very nature, is very imprecise. When the preparation of the budget becomes “accounting-driven,” those preparing it focus on nonexistent precision and lose sight of the real benefits of the budget and its impact on the bigger picture.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Accounting is conservative. It requires that the least favorable interpretation of events be presented. Business forecasting needs to be somewhat optimistic. Using a conservative sales forecast usually means that the budget will be finalized at the lower end of expectations. If the forecast is actually exceeded, as it is likely to be, the company will not be totally prepared to produce the product or deliver the services. In short, conservatism in accounting is required. Conservatism in business decision making can be very damaging.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Business is risky and filled with uncertainty. Accounting is risk-averse.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Resolution</h4>
<p class="para">To alleviate some of these cultural pressures, accountants need to learn more about the business—its markets, customers, competitive pressures, and operational issues—and all other business <a id="page_14"></a>managers need to learn more about the financial aspects of business. This includes the language of accounting and finance, the financial pressures with which the company must deal, and the financial strategies that may improve the company’s competitive position, operational effectiveness, and ultimate profitability.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rintr_sub6"></a>Some Additional Perspectives on the Planning Process</h3>
<p class="para">The planning process is a comprehensive management effort that attempts to ensure that the company has considered all of the issues and challenges facing it. The management team will focus on the company’s strengths and weaknesses as well as on the resources necessary to grow the business properly compared with the resources available.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The financial team is a critical contributor to this process. The following are some of the issues that require management focus.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">The Customers</h4>
<p class="para">Why do our customers buy our products and services? Why do we deserve their money? These are critical questions that must be answered if we are to focus the company’s energies and resources on those efforts that will sustain growth. We need to expand our definition of “the highest quality” and devote corporate cash and people to distinguishing the company from and staying ahead of the competition.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Do we really know our customers’ needs, present and future? Are we prepared to support them in their goal of succeeding in their marketplace? Do they view us as a key strategic partner? After all, we are in business to help our customers make money. If we define our company’s strategic mission accordingly, our customers’ success will be ours. What we do is only a means to that end.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">The Markets</h4>
<p class="para">Products and services are provided in numerous markets. These may be defined by:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li><a id="page_15"></a>Geography</li>
<li>Product application</li>
<li>Quality and perception of quality</li>
<li>Means of distribution</li>
<li>Selling channel (direct, distributor, Internet)</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">The process of thinking through the company’s future is an integral part of budget development. It requires that the management team be in touch with trends and developments that will enhance or detract from the company’s marketplace position. Periodic “outside-the-box” reexamination of each of these issues provides opportunities for considerable marketplace and profit improvement.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Resources</h4>
<p class="para">People and money must be dedicated to the most profitable, fastest-growing segments of the business. These business segments represent the future of the company and should be properly supported. Are our strategies and practices designed to hang on to the more comfortable past rather than focusing on the future? Intelligent planning and management controls do not inhibit creativity and aggressive risk taking. In fact, they ensure that the most important opportunities receive the resources that they require if they are to succeed.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">The Planning Process</h4>
<p class="para">The planning process involves the following elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinking through the future of the business</li>
<li>Enhancing communication among members of the management team so that plans and resources are consistently focused</li>
<li>Researching markets, competitors, and technologies to ensure currency of knowledge</li>
<li><a id="page_16"></a>Deciding among the identified opportunities and programs</li>
<li>Implementing those programs that contribute to the company’s strategic position and profitability</li>
<li>Developing a budget that documents the plan, each of the decisions made, and each department’s contribution to achieving company goals</li>
<li>Developing intelligent management controls to ensure that the company gets its money’s worth</li>
<li>Identifying and dealing with disruptive forces</li>
</ol>
<p class="para-ind">What can happen to us from pressures we don’t know about? Borders Book Stores was destroyed by Amazon, not by Barnes &amp; Noble. Tower Records by Apple Music. Camera film by smart-phones.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Properly focusing the planning process on the company’s strengths and weaknesses will help the company to achieve its strategic and financial goals. If the company truly understands its customers’ needs and helps them to achieve their goals, its progress will continue.</p>
<p class="para-ind">When all of these factors are put on the table, management must decide what actions should be taken. The financial team helps management to determine:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>How much the programs will cost</li>
<li>The forecast profitability benefits of the programs</li>
<li>Whether these forecast achievements are considered excellent</li>
<li>How much the company can afford</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">These questions are answered through the financial analysis of each proposal. The company will evaluate the plans using return on investment analysis, which is described in <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a> of this book. Once the decisions have been made, they are documented in the budget. The budget identifies who will achieve what and how much will be spent.</p>
<p class="para-ind"><a id="page_17"></a>The financial team will then determine whether the budget is guiding the company toward the achievement of its goals. It will do so through an analysis of the company’s ratios. Ratio analysis is described in <a href="chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Accountants will then record the actual events as they occur each month. As described in <a href="chapter09.html">Chapter 9</a>, they will then compare the actual revenues and spending with what was budgeted. This is called variance analysis. This same chapter also describes some of the operating decisions that will be made in order to enhance performance and ensure budget success.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Since the business environment is constantly changing, financial analysis is an ongoing process. Assumptions must be reviewed frequently, and action plans must be developed and revised to respond to changes in those assumptions. Cash must be constantly monitored.</p>
<p class="para-ind">With this perspective on the issues involved, context has been developed. Turn to <a href="chapter01.html">Chapter 1</a> to begin the discussion of financial statements.</p>
