<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_305"></a>Appendix D Answer Key</h2>
<p class="para">Here are the companies that match the sets of financial statements. For each company, a few of the ratios and other financial information that should have led you to match the company to the correct set of financial statements are mentioned.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">A. Home Depot</h4>
<p class="para">Home Depot is the country’s largest and most successful home improvement chain. They turn over inventory about 4.5 times per year, which corresponds to the seasons. Most sales are by credit card, which explains the low accounts receivable. Most stores are stand-alone rather than in malls, which explains the high fixed assets. Because customer service is so critical to their success, revenue per employee is relatively low.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">B. Walt Disney Company</h4>
<p class="para">Intellectual property is a very critical feature of this company’s success, and the numbers include recent acquisitions of Marvel Comics, Lucas Films (Star Wars), and Pixar (originally owned by Steve Jobs, whose family is among Disney’s largest shareholders). It is made up of very high-margin, fixed-cost businesses—think theme parks, cruise ships, and movies. Some receivables are low because some entertainment is paid in advance but the remainder is longer term financing.</p>
<h4 class="h4a"><a id="page_306"></a>C. Hess Oil</h4>
<p class="para">Hess is a very profitable oil exploration and refinery business and no longer focuses on retail operations. Its facilities are mostly in the Western hemisphere. When oil is either drilled or goes through a refinery, it flows through quite rapidly. This explains high inventory turnover experience (approximately one month). This is an extremely capital-intensive, fixed-cost business.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">D. Hain Celestial (Foods)</h4>
<p class="para">This company sells healthy versions of regular food products. It has really good margins and is growing rapidly as more outlets adapt healthy food strategies. Receivables are quite good given that sales are to retail chains which usually don’t pay too fast.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">E. Activis (Pharmaceuticals)</h4>
<p class="para">This is a roll-up of many acquisitions. Most of its products are generic versions of successful drugs that are off-patent. Its margins are quite good even though they are lower than biotech and traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing companies. They probably do much less R&amp;D than proprietary pharmaceutical manufacturers. The high goodwill is characteristic of a serial acquisition strategy.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">F. Ford Motor</h4>
<p class="para">This a global manufacturer with a vertically integrated business with fixed costs. It does well in North America but is having difficulties in Europe and Latin America (as are most global auto companies).</p>
<h4 class="h4a">G. eBay (before PayPal spinoff)</h4>
<p class="para">This is really two distinct businesses that do not belong together and will be separated by 2016. eBay is an online marketplace; PayPal <a id="page_307"></a>is a high-tech, point-of-sale payment company that processes payments from smartphones through the banks back to the accounts of the buyer and seller of products and services. One of its key competitors is ApplePay.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">H. Johnson &amp; Johnson</h4>
<p class="para">This tremendously successful manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, medical products and health-related consumer products sells primarily to hospitals and other healthcare providers. In this context, receivables are not terrible. Margins are very high. Inventory turnover is low because most products are manufactured internally and often require lengthy processing.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">I. Accenture</h4>
<p class="para">This is a global management consulting firm serving large businesses and governments. There is no inventory, no debt, and its fixed assets are primarily buildings and computer equipment. Revenue per employee is surprisingly low given that they provide high-value-added services.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">J. Con Edison</h4>
<p class="para">This is a very asset-intensive business. Its utility marketplace is very geographically concentrated in and around New York City, which contributes to a low days’ sales outstanding. It achieves high margins because it is a fixed-cost business in an expanding residential and business marketplace.</p>
