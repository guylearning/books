<p class="fimage"><img src="../images/f0021-01.jpg" alt="images" width="125" height="95"/></p>
<h2 class="h2b">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p class="para"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he two topics discussed in this chapter are an extension of the planning and budget process described in <a href="chapter12.html">Chapter 12</a>. They discuss a number of issues that can surface during the development of the budget. While <a href="chapter12.html">Chapter 12</a> describes many practices that make the process work successfully in corporations, the articles in this chapter identify in greater analytical detail what the outcomes of the budget process should be.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Many companies are managed from an accounting-oriented perspective. You would think that the 2008–2010 financial crisis would have been a wake-up call for clear thinking. Sadly, strategic thinking is not universal. There are certain characteristics, such as conservatism and being risk-averse, that are appropriate for the accounting department but may be less so for other areas. In those other areas, nontraditional management styles are often desirable and necessary. Many of the techniques of financial analysis that are described in this book support the more contrarian corporate strategies. But these articles are of particular interest because they advocate management thinking that is outside the box, nontraditional, and contrarian.</p>
<p class="para-ind"><a id="page_270"></a>“Profitability During Tough Times” offers some insights into how to thrive in a highly competitive environment. It advocates contrarian thinking and strategy development, and it offers some specific insights into how to focus on the real issues and break out of the traditional mold.</p>
<p class="para-ind">“Do the Right Thing” recognizes that companies sometimes need to retrench on expenses and redirect their focus. It suggests some specific actions that companies can take that will enable them to respond to difficult periods successfully without damaging the core competencies of the organization.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap13_sub1"></a>Profitability During Tough Times</h3>
<p class="para">Many of the strategies that were appropriate and effective in the past are no longer above reproach. In fact, we have learned over the years that the global marketplace is a dynamic place, full of turmoil—the growing value of the dollar against the euro and the 50 percent decline in oil prices are only two examples examples; therefore, rethinking past assumptions and engaging in outside-the-box thinking is always required. Organizations need to address this constant change. They must focus on the state of the world, both as it exists now and as it may be in the future, and raise their performance to new levels of effort and achievement.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Recent Progress</h4>
<p class="para">Product quality is no longer an issue. It is almost impossible to justify a multilevel pricing structure by offering different levels of product quality. Market segmentation now focuses on differences in features and support. Differences in product performance are acceptable. Differences in performance quality are not. Being the low-cost producer is still valuable, especially when sales are price sensitive. Moore’s Law, which states that in technology every three years the capability of the technology will double while the prices decline by half, still applies. Being vertically integrated is no longer <a id="page_271"></a>the path to becoming the low-cost producer as supply chain management becomes more and more efficient.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Responsive Service</h4>
<p class="para">You will gain competitive and profit advantages if you can compress the supply chain from your suppliers to your company to your customers. The amount of time required for this sequence of events has a substantial effect on your inventory, your accounts receivable, your profitability, and ultimately your cash flow. Service levels are affected as well, which may in turn affect your market share and sales growth.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Competitive Pricing</h4>
<p class="para">In many cases, competitive pricing means price reductions. Pricing pressure is not going to end any time soon. Asking our customers to pay for our inefficiencies is not an option. Many industries are experiencing price deflation and will continue to do so. This means that companies must find new ways to maintain their profit margins. The successful ones will become more efficient, find more value-added features to add to the product, and focus on new markets and distribution channels in order to remain competitive. Differentiation is becoming the new normal. Have you priced out a personal computer lately? Have you even considered purchasing a desktop computer now that there are so many other alternatives? Why buy a GPS for your car when you have the app on your smart-phone?</p>
<p class="para-ind">Companies will need to make a great effort to distinguish themselves from their competition. The new realities include very low interest rates, economic turmoil in Asia and elsewhere, essentially zero inflation, and a single global economy. However, a company’s profitability can be enhanced, even during tough times. These realities can serve as a competitive advantage if you refocus the attention of the organization on the fundamental realities of a successful business. You must find <em>your</em> company’s answers to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><a id="page_272"></a>Why are we special?</li>
<li>Why do we deserve to exist?</li>
<li>Why should customers buy our products?</li>
<li>Why do we deserve to have our customers’ money?</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="h4a">Attitudes and Strategies for Success</h4>
<p class="para">We exist to help our customers sell their products to their customers at a significant profit for both of us. This is called <em>strategic partnering</em>.</p>
<p class="para-ind">We need to help our customers solve problems and focus on their opportunities rather than merely providing products, since anyone can sell products. This is called <em>consultative selling</em>. This means we don’t need a store to sell retail products to consumers and don’t need warehouses to sell product to commercial customers.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Our prosperity is enhanced as we improve our customers’ ability to compete in their marketplace. We should know enough about our <em>customers’</em> businesses and markets to enable us to provide products and ideas that will make our customers special.</p>
<p class="para-ind">We must know no limits to our efforts.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Specific Action Strategies</h4>
<p class="para">The fundamental ingredients have not changed; only the environment in which we need to make things happen is different. Not only is thinking outside the box necessary, but I am no longer certain that there are many “boxes” remaining. Here are some strategies that are available to you:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Invest in sales professionals and their training and support. High-quality marketplace visibility is the most profitable investment your company can make.</li>
<li>Accelerate the development of innovative products and services. Focus your company’s resources, both people and money, on those products and services that offer the opportunity for significant financial reward. Persistence is <a id="page_273"></a>valuable—but not when it implies refusing to change direction when success will elude you if you continue as you are.</li>
<li>Use the strategic planning matrix developed by the Boston Consulting Group to measure the desirability of businesses relative to the resources dedicated to those businesses. This classifies your businesses into “cash cows,” ” stars,” “dogs,” and “question marks.” It puts these into the context of markets with opportunities spanning from terrific to poor. GE is currently divesting itself of its financial businesses using their own version of this matrix. Finance was as much as 40 percent of their businesses during the peak of the financial crisis in 2008 and will be reduced to less than 10 percent by 2018.</li>
<li>Learn more about the current global economic environment and persistent worldwide turmoil. How can you benefit? What are the risks? This has implications for buying, selling, and the supply chain throughout. Change is good because it creates opportunity for those who are prepared and ready to take action.</li>
<li>Expand your marketplace support to include participation in trade shows and industry showcases, advertising in well-directed journals and use of other media to communicate with existing and potential customers. Keep your customers aware of your constantly improving capabilities. If you have nothing new to say to your customers, your competitors will. You must become your own fiercest competitor.</li>
<li>Streamline the performance of your administrative support. Use technology in ways that let you derive its maximum value. Use experts to fill in and eliminate the knowledge gaps in your organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap13_sub2"></a>Do the Right Thing</h3>
<p class="para">Companies have worked hard at restructuring themselves in response to the dramatic changes that have occurred in the economy <a id="page_274"></a>and in their marketplaces in recent years. Even those that were very resistant to change were forced by the financial crisis that began in 2008; they finally had no choice. Fortunately the U.S. government imposed “wake-up” conditions on companies that it bailed out, including General Motors and AIG Insurance.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Here are seven of the most serious mistakes that companies have made in their efforts to change—and how to avoid them.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Mistake #1: Laying Off Only Lower-Level Support Staff</h4>
<p class="para">Personnel decisions are made by senior and middle management —who, of course, are not going to choose themselves for outplacement. As a result, the company ends up with many chiefs and not enough Indians. Six-figure executives spend their time typing, photocopying, and faxing when they should be meeting with customers and planning strategies.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Executives should prioritize entire programs, products, and markets based on their profitability and opportunity. Maintaining or even increasing the number of support staff and expanding their responsibilities makes more time available to executives to develop the business. Leave the more routine tasks to those who are best trained (and appropriately paid) to perform them.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Mistake #2: Seeing the Future as an Extension of the Past</h4>
<p class="para">During times of marketplace turmoil and uncertainty, some companies focus on those programs, strategies, and attitudes that worked well in the past. This provides a level of organizational comfort and eases the tensions associated with change. However, sticking to what has always worked well may, in fact, be perpetuating approaches that are no longer valid as a result of new market conditions.</p>
<p class="para-ind">There should be no sacred cows when the company underachieves. Reexamine and reprioritize all of the company’s operations and activities.</p>
<h4 class="h4a"><a id="page_275"></a>Mistake <strong>#</strong>3: Not Recycling Past Ideas That Merit Current Consideration</h4>
<p class="para">Whether an idea is profitable or not depends on both the timing of its implementation and the management support it receives. Something that did not work seven years ago may have considerable merit now.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The market may need some products and services today that it did not need in the past. List, explore, and give consideration to all ideas. With input from everyone concerned, make a list of <em>all</em> possible courses of action. Some resurrected fundamentals or past failures may in fact save the day. Imagine a company deciding in 2001 that selling on the Internet was not a good idea—and being unwilling to reconsider the decision in 2015. For example, certain large bulky products are not conducive to Internet sales. But the sales can be made through the website with the actual delivery made to the store for customer pickup or delivery. Home Depot has mastered this. Car dealers are not far behind in their progress.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Mistake <strong>#</strong>4: Reducing Price Rather Than Adding Value</h4>
<p class="para">Giving the customer a price discount may result in a sale. It can also encourage the customer either to expect further discounts in the future or to ask, “If you can afford to reduce the price now, does that mean that you were gouging me in the past?</p>
<p class="para">” Your objective is to create a loyal market, not merely to make a sale. Pressures to reduce the price are lessened when you add value to the sale. Value-added features could include:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Faster delivery</li>
<li>Higher quality</li>
<li>Educating customers on product applications</li>
<li>User conferences</li>
<li>Focus groups for product improvement</li>
<li>Improved customer service</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind"><a id="page_276"></a>These activities enhance your competitive position.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Remember: Getting a new customer is very difficult. Keeping an existing customer happy is a great challenge. Getting back a customer that you have already lost is almost impossible.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Mistake <strong>#</strong>5: Ignoring the 80/20 Rule</h4>
<p class="para">You need to realize that 20 percent of your customers provide 80 percent of your revenue, and 20 percent of your products result in 80 percent of your shipments. Less positively, 20 percent of your employees account for 80 percent of your absenteeism, and 20 percent of your customers are responsible for 80 percent of your overdue accounts receivable.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Companies confuse activity with productivity and productivity with effectiveness. They try to be all things to all people. Every order receives fanatical attention from exhausted, overworked people who hope and believe that if they can just work harder, things will improve. Focus your energies on the activities that are most important. The least important 80 percent of all corporate activity results in only 20 percent of the achievement. Do not dilute the effort and compromise the performance of the most important tasks by expending too much energy on that least important 80 percent. Intelligent corporate prioritizing and time management ensures that the most important work gets done.</p>
<p class="para"> </p>
<p class="centera">Achievement = Productivity = Effectiveness = Profitability</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Mistake <strong>#</strong>6: Holding Onto Sacred Cows</h4>
<p class="para">The entire business should be evaluated periodically, perhaps at budget time. Is each of the product lines and markets still providing its expected contribution? Is any product line or market consuming an inordinate share of corporate resources, beyond what is justified by present and expected future performance? What other, more profitable ventures can be implemented with underproductive resources? Should we really be in this business?</p>
<p class="para-ind">Target is a company that held on to a “sacred cow” for too <a id="page_277"></a>many years at a cost of billions. It entered the Canadian retail market by opening many stores, almost at once, and by buying an unsuccessful retail chain with over 100 locations. These decisions left it with a very high fixed-cost obligation and forced huge capital outlays before it knew whether Canadian shoppers needed Target at all. To cut their losses and close these stores required that the CEO acknowledge the mistakes, which he refused to do. His initial decision was his sacred cow. The company even forecast that they would need five more years of massive losses just to break even and it was clear that a successful, profitable future beyond those years was not assured.</p>
<p class="para-ind">A new CEO was brought into Target in 2014; he closed all of the Canadian stores and got rid of the management team that had cost them billions of dollars with this terrible strategy. Understand that there is nothing inherently wrong with Target having contemplated a Canadian market entry. Nordstrom, for example, entered the Canadian retail market with two stores and is doing quite well with minimal capital outlay. The problem with Target was the execution, not the goal—compounded by refusing to rethink their proposition even after it was clear that it was a disaster.</p>
<p class="para-ind">A company that had no sacred cows, GE Capital was the seventh largest financial institution in the country when the 2008 financial crisis hit. It represented 40 percent of GE’s business at that time. GE will essentially be a pure industrial company by 2018, selling off almost all of its financial businesses by that time.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Mistake <strong>#</strong>7: Relying on a Dominant Customer</h4>
<p class="para">Sometimes a highly valued customer becomes too big a part of our business portfolio. This is exciting but also very dangerous. A dominant customer can disappear on no notice. They can become arrogant and dictate onerous terms including lower price and shortened delivery terms. Qualcomm lost Apple as its largest customer and is taking a long time to recover.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Never let a customer represent more than 10 percent of your business, unless you have long-term contracts with provisions for <a id="page_278"></a>lengthy cancellation notice. In the 1980s Sears was notorious for imposing itself on its smaller vendors, extracting severe price and other concessions until the vendors became financially distressed—and worse. Sears has been among the worst financial performers of all retail chains in the 10-year time frame ending in 2016. Home Depot and Lowe’s now own the business.</p>
