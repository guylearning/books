<h2 class="h2b"><a id="rchap03"></a>The Statement of Cash Flows</h2>
<p class="para"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he third critical financial statement, along with the balance sheet and the income statement, is called the <em>statement of cash flows</em>. In the past, it was called the <em>sources and uses of funds statement</em>, which is a more accurate description of the information it contains. It describes in summary form how the company generated the cash flows it needed (sources) to finance its various financial opportunities and responsibilities (uses) over the past year. The sources and uses of funds statement for Metropolitan Manufacturing Company is shown in Exhibit 3-1. As you go through it, notice that the line items appear on the balance sheet in the column labeled “Changes.” In fact, the sources and uses of funds statement describes the changes in the balance sheets between two successive years, in this case 2016 and 2015. What we will do in this section is:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Present a sources and uses of funds statement.</li>

<p class="para">The paragraph numbers beginning below refer to the line items in Exhibit 3-1.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap03_sub1"></a>Sources of Funds</h3>
<h4 class="h4b">34. Net Income, $156,000</h4>
<p class="para">The company’s profits are a major source of funds. Therefore, net income is traditionally listed first. This number is also the <a id="page_72"></a>“bottom-line” number in the income statement that we saw in Exhibit 2-1 as line 31. In addition, it strongly affects the retained earnings amount on the balance sheet (line 21). Net income causes retained earnings to increase. Payment of cash dividends causes retained earnings to decrease. Therefore, the $110,000 change in retained earnings (income statement, line 33) is the net of:</p>
<table class="taba">
<tr>
<td>Net Income</td>
<td>$156,000   (31 and 34)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>– Dividends</td>
<td><span class="und">–  46,000   (32)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>= Change in Retained Earnings</td>
<td>$110,000   (33)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h4 class="h4a">35. Depreciation Expense, $56,000</h4>
<p class="para">In a more formal version of this statement, this item would be preceded by the heading: “Add Back Items Not Requiring the Disbursement of Cash.” The explanation of this is related to the discussion of expenses and expenditures in <a href="chapter01.html">Chapter 1</a>. When net income was calculated, an expense item was subtracted (line 28) that did not require a cash expenditure during this period and will never require one in the future. The item is depreciation expense. The expenditures related to this expense—i.e., capital expenditures—have already been made.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The depreciation expense was subtracted on line 28 for two reasons. First, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require this. Second, depreciation expense is deductible as an expense for corporate income tax purposes, and so including it provides tax benefits. However, for the sources and uses of funds statement, it is added back because in terms of cash flow, it was not a “real” (expenditure) subtraction during this period.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">36. Increase in Bank Notes, $130,000</h4>
<p class="para">During the year, Metropolitan Manufacturing Company raised $130,000 in additional short-term bank financing. This was added to its previously existing short-term bank debt of $170,000. Notice that Metropolitan Manufacturing Company added to its short-term debt while also paying off some long-term debt. By its very <a id="page_73"></a>definition, the long-term amount that was paid off was not due. If it had been due, it would have been classified as “current portion of long-term debt,” which is a <em>current</em> liability. There could be several explanations for this financing strategy, but it probably was related to the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates. Metropolitan probably borrowed short-term funds at a lower interest rate and used some of the funds to reduce its long-term loan, which had a higher interest rate.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">37. Increase in Accounts Payable, $110,000</h4>
<p class="para">When a company buys products and services on credit, the purchases are being financed by the supplier, who provides the product or service but does not receive payment for it at that time. Overall, an increase in accounts payable shows that the company is being financed by its vendors to a greater degree. This is not an analysis of the strategy of buying on credit, which involves having vendors finance purchases or extend payment periods to lengthy terms to provide a cheap source of cash. In an accounting report, like this one, it is merely a statement that the amount of accounts payable is larger than it was in the past. An increase in accounts payable can result from the following actions:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Taking more time to pay bills</li>
<li>Buying more product on credit</li>
<li>Paying higher prices for credit purchases</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4a">38. Increase in Other Current Liabilities, $39,000</h4>
<p class="para">Any increase in a liability is a source of funds. Since this category is made up primarily of accruals and similar items, it naturally increases each year as the company gets larger.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">39. Decrease in Investments, $3,000</h4>
<p class="para">The company sold some investments that were on the books for $3,000. These investments could have been bonds, long-term certificates <a id="page_74"></a>of deposit, or possibly the common stock of another company.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">40. Total Sources of Funds, $494,000</h4>
<p class="para">This is the sum of:</p>
<table class="taba">

<td align="right">$156,000</td>

<td align="right"><span class="bl_r1a">$494,000</span></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap03_sub2"></a>Uses of Funds</h3>
<h4 class="h4b">41. Capital Expenditures, $34,000</h4>
<p class="para">The company used $34,000 to add to its fixed assets. This is evidenced by the increase in the gross book value of fixed assets. Since assets are presented at the lower of cost or market, the only explanation for an increase in gross book value is the purchase of new fixed assets. Even if the older fixed assets here increased in economic value, like real estate, remember that the financial statements never reflect improved economic value.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">42. Increase in Inventory, $298,000</h4>
<p class="para">While inventory is sold and replenished many times during the course of the year (this is discussed more fully in <a href="chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>), on a net basis, Metropolitan has invested an additional $298,000 in inventory. The increase in the level of inventory could be the result of any combination of the following:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Replacement costs were greater than the cost of what was sold.</li>
<li><a id="page_75"></a>Costs per unit purchased have remained the same, but the number of units in inventory has increased.</li>
<li>The mix of products on hand has changed in the direction of the more expensive products.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">It cannot be determined simply from these inventory numbers whether inventory increased because sales forecasts were overly optimistic or because actual sales were disappointing. We do not know if this inventory increase was in raw materials, work in process, or finished goods. Analysis of these issues will be necessary. The only thing that is certain is that the financial investment in inventory has increased.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The reverse can be true as well. In 2014 oil companies showed drastic reductions in the inventory numbers on their balance sheets. In fact the inventory quantity of oil in barrels increased because of excess supplies in the market. The dollar decrease on the balance sheets resulted from the 50 percent price reductions that were endured.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">43. Increase in Accounts Receivable, $40,000</h4>
<p class="para">The company has “invested” this additional amount in financing its customers. This may be the result of any of the following:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Higher sales levels, either because prices are higher or volume is greater</li>
<li>Extending credit terms to give customers more time to pay</li>
<li>A deterioration in collection performance</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">Providing customers with credit terms is a marketing investment that, the company hopes, will produce more and happier customers who purchase more product. However, not enforcing those credit agreements is a sign of either accounting sloppiness or marketplace weakness (fear that customers are buying only because they can take their time in paying and would not buy if they could not have the extended time).</p>
<h4 class="h4a"><a id="page_76"></a>44. Decrease in Long-Term Debt, $50,000</h4>
<p class="para">Metropolitan Manufacturing Company used $50,000 to reduce its long-term debt. The rules of accounting provide strong evidence that this was a voluntary act. Long-term debt, by definition, is not due within the current year. As mentioned in the discussion of the increase in short-term bank debt, if this amount were due, it would have been classified as a current liability, most likely current portion of long-term debt. This payment could have been made because of any combination of the following:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>The interest rate on the long-term debt was high.</li>
<li>The company had extra cash.</li>
<li>The company used the proceeds from lower-cost short-term bank debt.</li>
<li>The long-term debt was selling at a discount from par value on a public market. The difference between par and the amount paid to buy it back at a discount is recorded as other income on the profit and loss statement.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4a">45. Payment of Cash Dividends, $46,000</h4>
<p class="para">The board of directors of Metropolitan Manufacturing Company voted to pay the holders of preferred and common shares cash dividends amounting to $46,000. Such dividends are traditionally but not necessarily voted on and disbursed on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Notice that retained earnings on the balance sheet (line 21) was affected by two activities, net income and cash dividends, as follows:</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap03_sub3"></a>Statement of Cash Flows</h3>
<p class="para">Generally accepted accounting principles requires a specific format for this information that is different from the more analytical format that we presented here. This format, called the <em>statement of cash flows</em>, is found in all published annual reports of public companies and also in the financial reports of almost every other company whose financials are prepared and produced by certified public accountants. The information is presented in three sections:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Cash flows provided by/used for operations</li>
<li>Cash flows provided by/used for investments</li>
<li>Cash flows provided by/used for financing</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">It is important to be familiar with and understand this format because most financial information that is available is presented in this manner. Note that uses of funds are shown in parentheses, indicating outflow, and that sources of funds are shown without <a id="page_78"></a>parentheses, indicating inflow. The statement of cash flows for Metropolitan Manufacturing Company is shown in Exhibit 3-2.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Before you begin the process of analyzing the data provided in Exhibit 3-2, it would be very useful for you to review the content and structure of the financial statements. To accomplish this, complete the financial statements exercise in Appendix A.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap03_sub4"></a>Analyzing the Statement of Cash Flows</h3>
<p class="para">Data becomes high-quality information if it helps the analyst to better understand the business, including its issues and problems and its strengths and weaknesses. When evaluating whether or not to provide funding to implement a proposed decision, having high-quality data means that the best information is available, supporting the decision that is best for the future of the company.</p>

<div style="margin-top:1em;"></div>
<p class="para-ind"><a id="page_79"></a>The following are some thoughts about evaluating the statement of cash flows in this context. Does it really provide high-quality decision and analytical support? As a key metric, is it consistent with the actions that we want managers to take?</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Cash Flow Provided by (Used for) Operations</h4>
<p class="para">Cash flow can be improved by slowing down payments to suppliers. An increase in accounts payable is a cash inflow. However, if the company postpones paying its suppliers until a point far beyond its agreed-upon payment terms, is this really a positive performance achievement? We think not. The company is forgoing profitable cash discounts and impairing relationships with suppliers, and it risks not receiving product in a timely manner, all to “improve” cash flow from operations.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Interest income from short-term investments appears in the net income amount. This is really not a cash flow from operations. Operations means making and selling products, the company’s business. The company can give the appearance of improving its operating cash flow by keeping cash idle rather than reinvesting it in the needs of the business, like buying machinery and hiring additional salespeople.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Gains from the disposal of assets (one-time events) are also included in net income in the category <strong>“</strong>other income and expenses.” Selling underachieving assets and businesses is certainly a positive strategy, and doing so certainly may generate valuable cash flow. But this is hardly a cash flow from an operating activity.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Interest expense on loans is also included in the net income amount. This cash outflow should really be characterized as a financing activity, rather than being included as part of operations.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Traditionally, the concept of free cash flow is defined as:</p>
<p class="block1">Cash Flow Provided by Operations<br/>Minus: Capital Expenditures<br/>Equals: Free Cash Flow</p>
<p class="para-ind">This has the connotation of “discretionary” cash flow and is often used by analysts to identify the amount of funds that <a id="page_80"></a>the company has available to implement profitable, market-penetrating opportunities. This is far from valid and should be viewed critically.</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>This definition implies that capital expenditures carry a higher priority than debt service (paying principal and interest to creditors). Paying required debt service certainly is more critical than capital expenditures (think default or bankruptcy). It’s like remodeling your kitchen and then not having the funds to pay the mortgage.</li>
<li>In order to “improve” free cash flow and “look better,” this metric motivates the company to fail to make necessary improvements, thereby reducing capital expenditures, in order to make free cash flow appear more favorable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">For Metropolitan Manufacturing Company, here is a more valuable, reconstructed statement of cash flows. Sadly, it is not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles—the almighty GAAP—and would probably not be acceptable in audited financial statements. However, remember that we are not doing accounting here. We are analyzing the business and are not bound by “accounting rules.”</p>
<p class="para-ind">We propose some changes in the free cash flow formula:</p>
<p class="para-t1"><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> From net income in “Cash Flows Provided by Operations” :</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Remove interest income. It becomes part of cash flows from investing activities. Buying interest-bearing securities, such as CDs or Treasury securities, is an investment. While doing so is worthwhile, it is not a “regular” part of operations and therefore not an “operating activity.”</li>
<li>Remove interest expense. Borrowing is a financing activity. Paying interest expense on those borrowed funds is also a financing expense. It becomes part of cash flows from financing activities.</li>
<li>Remove gains or losses from sale of assets. This is an investing activity. Although often not, it is supposed to be a one-time event.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-t1"><a id="page_81"></a><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> From Cash Flows Provided by Operations itself, remove changes in accounts payable. Accounts Payable is financing from vendors for products and services purchased and should be part of cash flows from financing activities.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Free cash flow would then become:</p>
<p class="para-ind"> </p>
<p class="hangsqarw9">Cash Flows Provided by Operations (minus the items just listed)</p>
<p class="hangsqarw9">Minus: Cash Flows for Debt Service</p>
<p class="hangsqarw9">Equals: A Better Version of Free Cash Flow</p>
<p class="para-ind"> </p>
<p class="para-ind">Be clear that we are not telling the accounting profession that their prescribed format is wrong. We never want to enter that debate. We seek to analyze our business and develop information that is useful in doing so. The goal of a metric, like the statement of cash flows, is to measure the financial health of a company so we can make intelligent management decisions. The revised format described here better accomplishes that.</p>
