<p class="para">By opening this book, you have set yourself apart and made the clear statement that you desire to improve your management ability. This book was created for you and to assist you in that effort.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Just as you cannot lead a parade if no one is following, you cannot manage if you don’t have a team to lead. Engrained in this book is the belief that a well-led team will always achieve results that are superior to those of an individual. Consistent with that conviction, this book has been written by a team. Three of us have taken up the challenge—at different times and in our own ways—of seeking to provide you with the best guidance we can muster for a new manager. The results of this joint effort are better because of our collaboration. The same will be true for you if you take to heart the insights you will discover in this book.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Summarizing thousands of words and hundreds of pieces of advice is nearly impossible. If forced to summarize, we believe the advice in this book centers around two overarching messages: be thoughtful in your actions and always conduct yourself with class. You will never regret either.</p>
