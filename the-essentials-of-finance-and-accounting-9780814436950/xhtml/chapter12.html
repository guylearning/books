<h2 class="h2b">Business Planning and the Budget</h2>
<p class="para"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he planning process is a cohesive management effort that organizes management knowledge, mobilizes the company’s resources, and focuses those resources on achieving the company’s goals. The first phase of this annual effort is somewhat strategic in nature. It might be best done off site because it requires managers to think about the business and to brainstorm ideas. A database of past information is helpful because there is a great deal to be learned, both positive and negative, from what has happened in the past. Considerable research is required in the areas of:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Markets</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>The economic environment</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Human resource issues</li>
<li>Organizational development</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_257"></a><a id="rchap12_sub1"></a>S.W.O.T. Analysis</h3>
<p class="para">S.W.O.T. stands for <em>s</em>trengths, <em>w</em>eaknesses, <em>o</em>pportunities, and <em>t</em>hreats. It is a form of management self-examination to ensure that all of the issues facing the company have been brought to the surface. The results of this self-examination should be action plans that identify:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Strengths:</em> The best opportunities available to the company. Is the company dedicating adequate resources to these opportunities? Are marketing and operational efforts synchronized? The company must make certain that its strengths are translated into competitive advantage and improved profitability.</li>
<li><em>Weaknesses:</em> Issues that make the company vulnerable to loss of market share and reduced profitability.</li>
<li><em>Opportunities:</em> Actions that the company can take to improve its performance and achieve its goals.</li>
<li><em>Threats:</em> The internal and external vulnerabilities that can damage the company’s future.</li>
</ol>
<p class="para-t">The S.W.O.T. analysis should cover a variety of areas, including:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Management</li>
<li>Products</li>
<li>Financial strength</li>
<li>Market position</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Operations</li>
<li>Distribution</li>
<li>The economic environment</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind"> </p>
<p class="para-ind">In summary, this effort is a corporate self-examination of where you are, where you want to go, and how you will get there. On the basis of this analysis, action plans indicating what steps should be taken now in order to attain the desired future should <a id="page_258"></a>be developed. The planning process does not eliminate risk. It attempts to ensure that the right risks are taken for the right reasons to attain the desired goals. Resource allocation is a key component of this effort. Will the most important projects be properly funded? Can crises be anticipated and unforeseen events dealt with?</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap12_sub2"></a>Planning</h3>
<p class="para">There are a number of reasons why planning is necessary:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>The future is not an extension of the past.</li>
<li>The rate of change in the marketplace will continue to accelerate.</li>
<li>Technological progress is taking place at an extraordinary rate.</li>
<li>Regulatory issues require constant attention.</li>
<li>Population changes, demographics, and geographic shifts require constant adjustment of marketing strategies.</li>
<li>Global competition is common in almost every industry.</li>
<li>Organizations and the workforce are becoming more complex.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4a">Types of Planning</h4>
<p class="para">Here are the five types of planning that companies engage in and some key issues involving each:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Strategic.</em> What businesses is the company in, and what businesses should it be in?</li>
<li><em>Marketing.</em> Why do customers buy the company’s products, and why should they? This should also include discussions of pricing, quality, and service strategies.</li>
<li><em>Sales effort.</em> Should the company sell through a dedicated organization, through distributors, or via the Internet? How can marketplace awareness of the company’s products be improved?</li>
<li><a id="page_259"></a><em>Operations.</em> What is the supply-chain strategy? How can technology improve customer service and reduce inventory at the same time? What functions can be more efficiently outsourced? How will demographic changes affect the workforce in the future?</li>
<li><em>Financial.</em> How much free cash flow does the company expect to generate? What are the internal (capital expenditures) and external (debt service) demands made upon these funds?</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="h4a">Requirements for Effective Planning</h4>
<p class="para">There are a number of elements that are required if planning is to be effective.</p>
<ol>
<li>Management must provide conspicuous support and active participation.</li>
<li>Goals must be quantifiable. In addition, if they are to be useful, goals must be:</li>
</ol>
<ul class="dmda">
<li>Time-related</li>
<li>Measurable</li>
<li>Attainable</li>
<li>Simple to calculate</li>
<li>Realistic</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-top:1em;"></div>
<p class="hangr">3. This is a profit center effort with staff support.</p>
<p class="hangr">4. Performance expectations should be reflected in the budget.</p>
<p class="hangr">5. The effort should be relatively flexible and simple. It should not constrain creativity, judgment, and risk taking.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Planning and Management</h4>
<p class="para">For planning to be effective, profit center managers need to have:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>A clear understanding of their job responsibilities</li>
<li>Good leadership through constant, clear communication of plans, goals, and direction</li>
<li><a id="page_260"></a>The opportunity to participate in planning and decision making</li>
<li>Recognition of their achievements</li>
<li>A performance appraisal system that gives them the opportunity to discuss advancement</li>
<li>Professional working conditions that are conducive to productivity and effectiveness</li>
<li>Compensation that is related to their accomplishments and responsibility</li>
<li>The opportunity to take normal business risks in a nonpunitive environment, without fear of excessive reprisals</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4a">Human Tendencies in Planning</h4>
<p class="para">There are a number of human tendencies that can interfere with or restrict the company’s planning process.</p>
<ul class="dmdb">
<li><em>Optimism:</em> The belief that performance will improve over the next few months</li>
<li><em>Short-term orientation:</em> An emphasis on quarterly and monthly goals and reviews, with the period beyond the first year being deemphasized</li>
<li><em>Oversimplifying the environment:</em></li></ul>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Not anticipating competitive reactions to the company’s moves</li>
<li>Assuming that the past will extend into the future</li>
<li>Point forecasting rather than forecasting a range of outcomes</li>
</ul>
<ul class="dmdb">
<li><em>Unwillingness to face tough issues:</em>
</li></ul>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Postponing corrective actions in the hope that the problem will disappear</li>
<li>Devoting attention to issues that are interesting but not critical</li></ul>
<ul class="dmdb">
<li><em>Ambiguity in strategic definition:</em>
</li></ul>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Overstating cash flow expectations</li>
<li><a id="page_261"></a>Understating capital needs</li>
<li>Having inadequate strategic coordination</li>
</ul>
<ul class="dmdb">
<li><em>Minimizing the difficulty of change:</em>
</li></ul>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Entering new, relatively unknown marketplaces</li>
<li>Not planning and testing new ventures adequately</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4a">Reasons Why People Resist Planning</h4>
<p class="para">There are a number of reasons why people resist the planning process:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>They have an unclear understanding of the benefits that can result.</li>
<li>Planning is time-consuming.</li>
<li>Planning requires intuitive thinking rather than simply doing.</li>
<li>The process requires writing plans and sharing them with others.</li>
<li>The process involves accountability; it creates an environment in which people will be measured and critiqued.</li>
<li>People often define themselves by what they do rather than by how they contribute to the organization’s profitability and success.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap12_sub3"></a>Significant Planning Guidelines and Policies</h3>
<p class="para">Planning guidelines and policies are statements or ground rules that provide a framework for management decisions and actions that are related to the achievement of organizational objectives.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The framework established by these guidelines and policies also affects decisions made within the context of the strategic plan. It is not concerned with day-to-day decisions as long as those decisions are consistent with the strategic objectives.</p>
<p class="para-ind">This framework, in general, serves three important purposes: It (1) provides guidelines, (2) establishes limitations, and (3) focuses direction. The framework is important for planning in a number of ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>It helps to sharpen and define the organization’s mission and focus.</li>
<li>It eliminates the need to make the same decisions repeatedly.</li>
<li>It ensures that efforts are not directed toward areas that are not acceptable to senior management.</li>
<li>It provides measurable parameters for performance that cannot be violated without triggering a managerial response.</li>
</ol>
<p class="para-ind">What follows are some examples of policies and policy statements from a variety of corporate perspectives that help to illustrate these points and can serve as models for anyone whose job it is to create and draft policies.</p>
<p class="para-t"><em>Financial</em></p>
<p class="hangsqarw">The company will reinvest at least 60 percent of its net income in the business.</p>
<p class="hangsqarw">It is the company’s objective to pay a regular dividend to common shareholders on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p class="para-t"><em>Corporate Development</em></p>
<p class="hangsqarw">The company will not enter any business in which the market growth rate is less than 15 percent.</p>
<p class="hangsqarw">All acquisitions of other companies, whether in whole or in part, must have the approval of the board of directors.</p>
<p class="hangsqarw">Companies will be acquired only if their markets are known to senior management and there are synergistic benefits to the relationship.</p>
<p class="hangsqarw">Our corporate image and purpose shall always be maintained. We will consider only opportunities for investment or acquisition that will maintain or enhance our corporate image of progressiveness, technical excellence, customer commitment, and merchandising preeminence in the sale of quality products and services. New opportunities will not be considered if they will <a id="page_263"></a>in any way compromise the reputation for being an ethical company with due regard to human and social responsibilities that we have worked so hard to achieve and maintain. Our employees command respect for their business abilities, integrity, fairness, and humanity.</p>
<p class="hangsqarw">Investment, whether capital expenditure or corporate acquisition, requires a return on equity of 20 percent or greater. This serves to enhance our current expectations for corporate performance.</p>
<p class="para-t"><em>Corporate</em></p>
<p class="hangsqarw">The company will prepare a three-year strategic plan and an annual budget.</p>
<p class="hangsqarw">The company will establish goals for each of these documents, measure the performance of its staff against these parameters, and incorporate these evaluations into its compensation plans.</p>
<p class="hangsqarw">It is company policy to comply with all OSHA and EPA regulations. We will develop training programs that will assure compliance without the need for outside audit. The company will make certain that employee safety is always emphasized and is never compromised in any of its activities.</p>
<p class="hangsqarw">It is the company’s policy to comply with generally accepted accounting principles in the preparation of information for any regulatory agency, financial institution, or other party that may receive this information.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap12_sub4"></a>Some Additional Issues</h3>
<p class="para">Budgets should be developed by those who have the responsibility for meeting them, subject to the requirements and expectations of the organization.</p>
<p class="para-ind">A budget need not be completely detailed in every respect in order to be effective and valuable. The level of detail should be governed by the value of the information being developed.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Every excellent plan is almost out of date by the time it is being <a id="page_264"></a>used. The value of the planning process is the thinking, research, and communication that it fosters.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The coordinator of the budget process should have considerable knowledge of the business, its products, and its markets. While a knowledge of accounting and finance is important, developing the budget is a management challenge rather than an accounting responsibility.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap12_sub5"></a>A Guide to Better Budgets</h3>
<p class="para">Here are some steps that will help you in preparing a budget:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Start simple.</li>
<li>Have each function and area of responsibility prepare its own budget, consistent with the corporate goals, objectives, constraints, and policies.</li>
<li>Recognize that effective budgets require senior management approval and the endorsement of the organization.</li>
<li>Understand that having a budget improves the performance of the entire organization and each of its parts—really.</li>
<li>Understand that a budget is developed to ensure that every department head is working toward the same goal and knows the department’s resources and constraints.</li>
<li>Recognize that the budget department does not create the budget. It is simply a coordinator, consultant, and adviser.</li>
<li>Arrange educational meetings to ensure that everyone involved has an understanding of the process and the expectations for it. Do this at least twice during the process.</li>
<li>Make certain that interdepartmental relations are coordinated. Departments cannot perform well without the cooperation of other departments. Make certain that these interdependencies are properly documented.</li>
<li><a id="page_265"></a>Ensure that expenditures above a specific threshold amount that are included in the budget are supported with proper documentation and financial analysis.</li>
<li>Incorporate into the budget procedure specific requirements covering approval for nonbudgeted expenditures and cost overruns.</li>
<li>To sell the budget concept, select one department or profit center manager to convey the value of developing an intelligent budget. Demonstrate how the budget has improved the performance of this manager’s organization. The word will spread among the manager’s peers.</li>
<li>Express budget procedures in writing. Document corporate targets, policies, and constraints, and convey them to everyone who is involved in the process. Update this documentation frequently.</li>
<li>Provide each involved department with information on the department’s past financial and statistical history, known economic factors, and the accounting chart of accounts in order to properly prepare the department for effective participation.</li>
<li>Classify the expenditures of individual departments carefully. Do not arbitrarily allocate common costs to individual profit centers.</li>
<li>Budget product and service costs on a per-unit basis, if possible. Be realistic.</li>
<li>Do not create theoretical models that make accountability unachievable.</li>
<li>Prepare budgets that incorporate alternative environments and competitive factors. Have a fallback plan available for emergencies; identify best-and worst-case scenarios. This enhances the thought process.</li>
<li>Base the sales forecast on realistic expectations. Like all other elements of the budget, it should be achievable, but a challenge.</li>
<li>Establish production plans in accordance with a detailed forecast. Incorporate purchasing and inventory strategies and product pricing expectations.</li>
<li><a id="page_266"></a>Incorporate the cash flow improvements from the capital expenditure budget into the operating budget. These are interrelated parts of the planning process.</li>
<li>Develop and share the positive and negative elements of past budget efforts, and incorporate them into the current process. Learn from both the successes and the mistakes.</li>
<li>Make sure that reports of actual performance are provided to responsibility centers in a timely manner, with the appropriate level of detail.</li>
<li>Never forget that a budget and its forecast components are estimates.</li>
<li>Precision does not count.</li>
<li>Improve the quality and effectiveness of the process continuously. Make sure everyone knows that you are focusing on this issue. Solicit and accept feedback from participants.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap12_sub6"></a>Preparation of the Budget</h3>
<h4 class="h4a">Sales Planning</h4>
<p class="para">Consider the historical patterns of behavior for your customers, your markets, your products, and your competitors. The success of your company depends on the success of your customers.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Your company’s sales will be affected by the economy. Identify how future economic events will affect your business. This includes looking at the consumer outlook, inflation, taxes, political events, and the business cycle.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Ask the sales organization for its input. The salespeople know their customers and markets better than anyone else. Salespeople are optimistic, by their stereotypical nature. On the other hand, they have been known to “low-ball” forecasts in order to minimize their quotas. Somehow, given the balance between these two forces, a consensus forecast by the sales team usually provides very usable information.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Identify all known or anticipated events that will affect your <a id="page_267"></a>market during the upcoming year. This should include competitors entering or leaving the market and product additions and eliminations. Industry trade shows are an excellent source of this information: Look at what is and what is not being featured. What shows companies take booths at is often an indication of those companies’ perceived strategic identity.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The sales and marketing teams should identify the level of customer service that is necessary if the company is to achieve a competitive advantage. Strategies involving inventory and the entire supply chain should be based upon customer service expectations.</p>
<p class="para-ind">For companies that do business on a global basis, it would have been almost impossible to forecast the strength of the U.S. dollar in the 2014–2015 time period. This has seriously improved the prospects of those companies that import their raw materials, components, and products because foreign purchases are 10 to15 percent less expensive. However, companies that export to Europe have experienced a serious competitive disadvantage as their products are now between 10 and 15 percent more expensive. You would have had to be clairvoyant to have known this in 2012—or to know when the pendulum will next swing in the other direction—but currency issues should certainly be part of the S.W.O.T. analysis discussed earlier in this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Operations Planning</h4>
<p class="para">Capacity should be defined based upon the expected product mix. This will provide insights into pricing decisions and decisions concerning whether to pursue marginal business.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Product mix capability and flexibility are very important. How rapidly machinery can be changed between products will provide guidance for determining the required minimum orders and the extent to which discounts should be offered for very large orders.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The company should consider the number of shifts to be operated. This depends on both the relative efficiency of each shift and the size of an ideal production run. If machine changeover is expensive, working four 10- or 12-hour shifts will be more cost-effective <a id="page_268"></a>than working five 8-hour days. Overtime can be built into the schedule.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Technology can make a major contribution to improving the efficiency of the overall operation. Establishing computerized hookups among customer orders, machine and workforce schedules, and raw material logistics will:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Improve customer service.</li>
<li>Accelerate billing and cash flow.</li>
<li>Reduce work in process inventory and time.</li>
<li>Reduce raw materials inventory.</li>
<li>Usually pay for itself in less than a year.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">The capital budget can be prepared after all of the previously mentioned analyses have been performed. Return on investment analysis and the capital budget are discussed at some length in <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
<p class="para-ind">You should consider outsourcing less important resource-consuming operations. This will free up assets, cash, and people for more important activities in which your company provides more value-added contribution.</p>
