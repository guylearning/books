<h2 class="h2b">Financing the Business</h2>
<p class="para"><span class="dropcap">B</span>orrowing money is a very positive corporate strategy. It helps the company to increase its growth, finance seasonal slowdowns, and invest in opportunities that will ensure its future. However, while the proper financing strategy will support these objectives, the wrong financing strategy will make what otherwise would be excellent corporate programs vulnerable to failure.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Business and our global economy are very dynamic. They are constantly changing, and the rules are always being redefined. Therefore, financing strategies must also be dynamic. What was appropriate for the company six months ago may be very undesirable now. So, like most other aspects of the business, the company’s financing strategy requires constant monitoring and revision.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Those members of the management team who are responsible for marketing, operations, human resources, and technology have no direct responsibility for the company’s relations with the financial community, although in a smaller company they may participate in this process when a major project is involved. <a id="page_240"></a>All senior executives of public companies will be called upon to answer questions posed by stockholders and the financial community.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Every major project of the company will ultimately be affected by the existence, form, and quantity of the financing that the company secures. Budgets are expanded and people are hired because of new financing. Budgets and headcounts are reduced when financing is not obtained or the terms are onerous.</p>
<p class="para-ind">This chapter is included in this book because every businessperson has a serious vested interest in financing and financial strategy. The main issues affecting financing are its:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Maturity</li>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Conditions and restrictions</li>
<li>Payment schedule</li>
<li>Collateral</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">There are two classes of financing, debt and equity.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap11_sub1"></a>Debt</h3>
<p class="para">A company that uses debt to finance its business can engage in either short-term or long-term borrowing. Short-term borrowing involves loans with a maturity of one year or less. It is used to cover current cash needs, such as financing growth, seasonal cash flow needs, and major customer orders. The loans in this category are often called working capital loans, because that is what they finance.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Long-term loans have maturities of longer than one year. Companies borrow long term to finance major capital expansions, research and development projects with longer time horizons, and real estate.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Short-Term Debt</h4>
<p class="para">There are a number of types of both short-and long-term debt, and a number of related elements. We first cover those having to do with short-term debt:</p>
<ol>
<li><a id="page_241"></a>Accounts receivable financing</li>
<li>Factoring</li>
<li>Inventory financing</li>
<li>Floor planning</li>
<li>Revolving credit</li>
<li>Zero-balance accounts</li>
<li>Lines of credit</li>
<li>Credit cards</li>
<li>Compensating balances</li>
</ol>
<p class="para"><strong><em>Accounts Receivable Financing.</em></strong> This is an excellent form of short-term financing that helps the company manage its cash flow. It involves using part or all of the company’s accounts receivable as collateral for short-term loans. The collateral might include only specific invoices if some of the invoices are over 90 days old or if some customers’ credit is not of high quality. (If the latter is true, perhaps these customers shouldn’t be given credit at all.) By refusing to lend against these invoices, the bank is protecting itself from lending against the receivables of customers with low credit ratings. At the same time, it is giving the company some sound advice regarding its dealings with these customers.</p>
<p class="para-ind">With accounts receivable financing, the company retains the credit risk if its customers do not pay, and the company is responsible for collecting on its customers’ accounts. Repayment schedules for this type of financing are highly negotiable. The company should make certain that undesirable inflexibilities are not built into the repayment terms. There are critical “shades of gray” between financial discipline and bank-imposed restriction. Banks and other lenders will typically create a line of credit equal to between 70 and 90 percent of qualified accounts receivable.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Factoring.</em></strong> In this financing alternative, the company actually sells its qualified accounts receivable to a bank or to an independent factoring company at a discount from their face value. The company receives immediate cash for its invoices. The invoices will <a id="page_242"></a>direct the customers to pay the funds directly to the bank or factoring company (the factor).</p>
<p class="para-ind">This form of financing is expensive compared with alternative forms. In addition, it may lead customers to misjudge the company’s financial position and conclude that it is having financial difficulties. The factor may have the right to take the initiative and call overdue accounts directly.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Factoring can cost between 2 and 5 percent per month. This could significantly cut into margins, especially if the borrower is in a low-margin business. However, if the terms of sale are currently 2/10, n/30, factoring may be a desirable alternative. Selling on terms of 2/10, n/30 means that the customer can take a 2 percent discount off the invoice amount if the invoice is paid within 10 days of the invoice date, and payments are expected within 30 days in any event. With these terms, customers will either take the 2 percent discount or delay payment for up to 30 days. If factoring costs 2 percent and the company can get its cash immediately, this is an attractive alternative.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Accounts receivable can be sold to a factor either with or without recourse. If the sale is without recourse, the buyer of the accounts receivable (the factor) assumes the full credit risk. If the customer does not pay, the factor loses the money. If the sale is with recourse, the company assumes the ultimate responsibility for credit losses if the customer does not pay. Selling without recourse is very expensive. Because only very high-quality receivables qualify for this form of financing, there is rarely a credit loss. Thus, selling without recourse is rarely advantageous. Companies can actually buy credit insurance that protects them against credit loss.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Inventory Financing.</em></strong> Usually only finished goods and raw materials inventory qualify as collateral. There is no market for work in process. Lenders will usually provide financing in the amount of one-half of the collateral that qualifies. This is a good form of financing to cover the cost of fulfilling a very large order from a high-quality customer, or perhaps, in a seasonal business, to <a id="page_243"></a>cover a period of high cash needs that will be followed by a period of high cash inflows.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Using inventory as collateral requires fairly sophisticated inventory control methods, including systems support. This imposes corporate self-discipline, which the company should have anyway.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Floor Planning.</em></strong> Floor planning is a special form of inventory financing that is very common in the retail sale of very high-priced products, such as boats, cars, and appliances. With this form of financing, it is the vendor and its products that must be credit-qualified. The lender buys the products from the manufacturer and places them in the retailer’s store and supporting warehouse, in effect lending them to the retailer.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The lender retains title to the products. When the retail dealer sells a product, the dealer must first pay the lender in order to get title to that product, which it can then transfer to the purchasing customer. This may be a simultaneous transaction, so that the retailer just receives the difference between the selling price and the loan amount.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Floor planning is often provided by a finance company owned by the manufacturer. The manufacturer and its associated finance company will provide various “bargains” to induce the retailer to overload on inventory. This smooths out the manufacturing process and places a lot of product in the dealer’s showroom, which presumably will help sales. Slow-moving product is often provided to the dealer at zero financing cost as a way for the manufacturer to handle excess inventory.</p>
<p class="para-ind">As a business lesson, count the number of cars in a dealer’s lot, calculate the estimated value of those cars (maybe the number of cars x $20,000), and multiply that by 1 percent per month (the interest the dealer has to pay on the loan). It may very well be lower than 1 percent per month but it’s an easier mental calculation. You can get an idea of how many cars a dealer must sell each month just to cover its floor plan interest expense.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Revolving Credit.</em></strong> This is basically a working capital loan with accounts receivable and inventory as collateral. <a id="page_244"></a>The maximum amount of the loan is based on a formula tied to high-quality inventory and accounts receivable. For example, the maximum amount might be 75 percent of accounts receivable less than 60 days old and 50 percent of finished goods and raw materials inventory less than 60 days old. This formula forces the company to make regular payments and reduce the outstanding debt when the inventory is used and the receivables are collected.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Because of the pressure to repay and the constant monitoring of working capital, it would be very dangerous for a company to use this form of funding to support long-term projects. Some banks require what is known as a “cleanup” period. This means that for some period of time, perhaps one month per year, the loan balance must be zero.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Zero-Balance Accounts.</em></strong> This type of account may very well be required by another loan agreement. In a “regular” loan, the borrower collects funds from its customers, deposits the funds in the company checking account, and makes some sort of payment to the lender for principal and interest on the loan. With a zero-balance feature, the loan and the checking account are connected. When customer payments are deposited in the checking account, the funds are automatically used to reduce the loan balance and pay the interest that is due. Since the account balance is therefore zero, when the company writes checks, these checks increase the loan balance.</p>
<p class="para-ind">This feature is very similar, conceptually, to the overdraft privileges attached to individuals’ checking accounts (although individuals usually decide how much of the funds they deposit should be used to reduce the loan balance, subject to a minimum monthly payment). This feature can be very beneficial to the company because float is reduced to zero. Customer payments automatically reduce the loan balance. The interest rate may also be advantageous because the bank knows that as the company receives payments from its customers, the loan will be repaid. Also, the company borrows only the exact amount it requires.</p>
<p class="para-t"><a id="page_245"></a><strong><em>Lines of Credit.</em></strong> A line of credit is not a loan; it is a very favorable method of securing a loan. The cliche’ describing this arrangement is “borrow when you don’t need it so that you will have it when you do.”</p>
<p class="para-ind">Suppose that a company is considering expansion plans or a major expenditure that will take place sometime within the next six months. The company’s balance sheet is strong, and its need for the loan is uncertain, or at least not immediate. The company can go to the bank and arrange for a line of credit. This is an advance reservation that makes funds available, to be used only if and when they are needed.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The advantages of a line of credit are:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>The loan is arranged at a time chosen by the borrower.</li>
<li>The funds are available; they can be used or not, at the choice of the borrower.</li>
<li>The company is in a position to make major purchase commitments, knowing that this and maybe other financing options are available.</li>
<li>It provides considerable purchase price bargaining power.</li>
<li>Interest payments do not begin until the funds are actually used.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">The company will pay a reservation fee, probably somewhere around 1 percent of the total line. Payment terms, interest, and other fees and collateral requirements will be the same as those on any other loan and are always negotiable. This is conceptually the same as a homeowner’s equity line of credit.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Credit Cards.</em></strong> More and more customer orders are being placed by phone or by computer over the Internet. Allowing the customer to pay by credit card accomplishes a number of things:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>It eliminates accounts receivable, thus eliminating the wait for the money and the associated paperwork.</li>
<li>The customer’s creditworthiness need not be evaluated.</li>
<li><a id="page_246"></a>There will be no overdue receivables.</li>
<li>The customers can take as much time as they want to pay.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">For smaller orders, waiting for customer payments and making the often inevitable collection phone calls can eliminate the profit. Although the company must pay the credit card fee, which is approximately 2 percent, accepting credit cards will make small orders profitable. This form of payment was often resisted. With the expansion of debit cards, point-of-sale payment systems tied to smart phones, PayPal and other Internet mechanisms, individuals and companies are becoming more comfortable with automatic payment systems. This transfers credit risk from the selling company to the credit company, which is usually better qualified to evaluate credit riskiness anyway. It also diminishes, if not eliminates, expensive invoicing, bad debts, and waiting for your money.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Compensating Balances.</em></strong> Requiring compensating balances is a bank strategy that increases the effective cost of borrowing money without increasing the stated interest rate. A compensating balance means that the borrower is required to keep a certain minimum balance in the checking account at all times.</p>
<p class="para-ind">If a company borrows $1,000,000 for one year at 10 percent, the interest rate is obviously 10 percent. However, if a 10 percent compensating balance is required, the borrower has the effective use of only $900,000. This results in an effective rate of about 11 percent. If the borrower really needs $1.0 million, it must borrow approximately $1.1 million. Like loan origination fees, collateral audit fees, search fees, and other such charges, compensating balances are a cost of borrowing and can be negotiated.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Long-Term Debt</h4>
<p class="para">The following types of long-term debt are covered here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Term loans</li>
<li>Bonds</li>
<li><a id="page_247"></a>Debentures</li>
<li>Mortgage bonds</li>
<li>Convertible bonds</li>
<li>Senior debt</li>
<li>Subordinated debt</li>
<li>Junk bonds</li>
</ol>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Term Loans.</em></strong> This is the form of long-term debt that businesses use most frequently. It is a loan from a bank to a company that is used to finance expansion efforts. It has a fixed maturity date, frequently five to seven years from the date of the loan. The company will repay the loan in monthly installments of principal and interest. Spreading the payment of the principal over the life of the loan is called <em>loan amortization</em>. The monthly payments of principal and interest are called <em>debt service</em>. The amortization of the principal can also take place over a period that is longer than the loan period. With this arrangement, the remaining principal is due at the end of the loan period. That ending balance is called a <em>balloon payment</em>.</p>
<p class="para-ind"><strong><em>Bonds.</em></strong> A bond has many characteristics similar to those of a term loan. There are two differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>A bond is a negotiable instrument that can be bought and sold like common stock.</li>
<li>A bond is usually sold to the public through a public offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</li>
</ol>
<p class="para-ind">Bonds are usually sold in units of $1,000. A bond that is selling at its face value is said to be selling at par. The interest rate is called the coupon. After these securities are issued, their prices fluctuate in accordance with economic conditions. The prices of many bonds are quoted daily in major financial publications. Bonds usually make interest payments only, with the principal being repaid at maturity.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em><a id="page_248"></a>Debentures.</em></strong> A debenture is a bond that has only “the full faith and credit” of the company as collateral. Other than the credit rating and creditworthiness of the debtor, there is no specific collateral. The owners of these bonds, therefore, are classified as unsecured creditors.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Mortgage Bonds.</em></strong> A mortgage bond differs from a debenture only in that there is specific collateral to back up the security. Owners of these bonds are known as secured lenders. Because of this collateral, the interest rate should be lower than that on a debenture.</p>
<p class="para-ind"><strong><em>Convertible Bonds.</em></strong> This is a type of debenture with a very interesting feature. If a company does not have a high credit rating and therefore does not qualify for a reasonable interest rate, it would be prohibitively expensive for that company to sell bonds. Remember that investors and lenders have very different views on risk and reward. An investor may take a very high risk in the hope of experiencing a very high reward. A lender can never make more than the interest rate, and thus a lender that takes a very high risk may lose everything, but does not have the prospect of a high reward. The convertible bond changes the risk/reward relationship for the lender.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The bond is sold at a relatively low interest rate, perhaps 7 percent rather than the 12 percent that the company would otherwise have to pay. The owner of the bond has the right to convert the bond into shares of common stock at a predetermined price called the <em>strike price</em> (which is higher than the stock price at the time the bond is issued) at a later date. The company enjoys an affordable interest rate and can now expand its business. The owners of the convertible bonds get some interest and share in the rewards of success if the company does well and the price of the stock increases to above that strike price. Prices of convertible bonds are listed in the bond price tables in major financial publications with the extra symbol CV.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Senior Debt.</em></strong> This is a debenture issue that gives its holders priority over the holders of all other debenture issues in receiving <a id="page_249"></a>interest payments and access to the company’s assets in the event of a bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Subordinated Debt.</em></strong> Holders of this type of debt have priority below that of the holders of senior debt. Because of this secondary position and the resulting higher risk, holders of this debt will receive a higher interest rate than the holders of senior debt.</p>
<p class="para-t"><strong><em>Junk Bonds.</em></strong> The creditworthiness of most companies and their securities is rated by various agencies, such as Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s. Bonds with the three or four highest ratings are generally classified as investment grade. Bonds in this category are recommended for pension funds and very conservative investors.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Bonds that do not qualify for these high ratings have a much smaller pool of available buyers. As a result, they must pay considerably higher interest rates, and so they are referred to as “high yield.” As a company’s creditworthiness declines, the yield on its bonds increases at an increasing rate because of the incrementally greater risk. When bonds reach a very high-yield, lower-quality status, they are known as “junk” bonds.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap11_sub2"></a>Equity</h3>
<p class="para">Selling common and preferred shares is essentially a permanent form of financing. It is also a form of financing that requires no repayment. In addition to raising funds, equity may also be issued for the purpose of expanding ownership of the stock, reducing concentration of voting power, and making the stock more liquid for stock market purposes.</p>
<p class="para-ind">There are three particularly important categories under the general heading of stockholders’ equity that deserve attention here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Venture capital</li>
<li>Preferred stock</li>
<li>Common stock</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="h4a">Venture Capital</h4>
<p class="para"><a id="page_250"></a>Investors who supply venture capital are usually financing not much more than an idea, perhaps supported by a business plan. To obtain this type of financing, the founders of a company must be people who have some sort of track record or credentials indicating that they can effectively span the gap between an idea and a marketable product. Venture capital financing is most frequently available to high-tech ideas. Venture capital financiers are a very valuable source of early-stage investment funds. The companies they finance are not candidates for any sort of bank borrowing unless the principals or their backers are high-net-worth individuals who are willing to personally guarantee the loans.</p>
<p class="para-ind">People who are seeking venture capital financing will have a number of fundamental issues to deal with. Venture capital investors will want a large piece of the equity so that if the company is successful, the reward for its success will cover the cost of their probable other failures. They will be also intimately involved in deciding how their money will be spent. On the other hand, the company founders may very well not have any alternative, and they also may not have the managerial and marketing skills needed to create a viable business. Therefore, unless the company founders have an “angel” investor, venture capital is a very valuable option.</p>
<p class="para-ind">An “angel” investor is usually a high-net-worth individual who finances start-ups that may not appear attractive to more traditional investment firms. Such an investor often mentors the start-up’s management team and provides necessary management and marketing skills.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Preferred Stock</h4>
<p class="para">Preferred stock is a hybrid class of equity that is usually associated with mature businesses that have considerable, predictable cash flow. The company may have very large amounts of investment in fixed assets and limited ability to raise money through debt issues. Preferred shareholders receive an indicated, but not <a id="page_251"></a>guaranteed dividend. In periods when cash is tight, holders of preferred stock receive their full dividend before common shareholders can receive any dividend. Preferred stockholders generally are not entitled to vote for members of the board of directors or on any other proxy matters, unlike common shareholders, but they may have an option to convert their stock into common stock. While interest payments on debt are tax-deductible for the issuer, preferred dividends are not. Thus, this is a fairly expensive form of financing for the company.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Common Stock</h4>
<p class="para">A company that is going public for the first time will do an <em>initial public offering</em>, or IPO. By going public, the company can both raise a considerable amount of cash and create a market for the stock. This means that the stock held by the existing owners (the company’s founders and venture capitalists) will become a liquid asset, enabling them to eventually sell some of it. Going public is very expensive. SEC filings and legal expenses can cost many hundreds of thousands of dollars. In addition, the equity of the existing owners of the company will be diluted, possibly to the point where they will lose effective control of the company.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Many public companies issue additional shares to investors over the years to raise funds or to improve the liquidity of the stock, and many also make shares available to their employees.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap11_sub3"></a>Some Guidance on Borrowing Money</h3>
<p class="para">Whenever a company borrows money, whether it is to finance an expansion, to cover working capital needs, or to acquire another business, preparation is required. It is important to understand that payments of principal and interest will often be required each month.</p>
<ol>
<li>Interest payments are a tax-deductible expense and will appear on the income statement. Repayments of principal <a id="page_252"></a>are not an expense, will not appear on the income statement, and are not tax-deductible.</li>
<li>Only the principal portion of the unpaid balance will appear on the balance sheet; it will appear as a current liability if it is due within one year or as long-term debt if it is due in more than one year, or it may be split between the two categories. Interest is never a liability on the balance sheet unless a payment is overdue or unless, in the case of bonds, the balance sheet date falls between coupon payments and the amount applicable to the period before the balance sheet date is recorded. This will be referred to as an accrued liability.</li>
<li>As previously mentioned, the key issues to be negotiated when arranging a loan are:
<p class="hangsqa"><em>The amount.</em> When the company is planning the project, a cash flow forecast is necessary, both for analytical purposes and also to present to the bank. Don’t ask for less money than you really need. This may impair rather than improve your negotiating ability. Some people believe, incorrectly, that asking for a smaller amount will increase their chances of having the loan approved. In addition, being inadequately funded will hurt the project and may require you to cut back at a time when you are trying to build the business. This is very counterproductive.</p>
<p class="hangsqa"><em>The interest rate.</em> Evaluate the issue of a fixed rate versus a variable rate. A variable rate may be tied to the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) or the prime rate. For example, it may be quoted as “prime + 2,” which means two percentage points above the prime rate. If it is tied to a prime rate, make sure that you know whose prime rate will be used. Will it be your bank’s prime rate or the rate quoted by the large money center banks, such as Citi, Chase, or Bank of America? Understand that when interest rates are moving higher, they <a id="page_253"></a>generally move quickly. This is in the bank’s best interest. When interest rates are declining, however, they are often “sticky,” meaning that they are slow to move.</p>
<p class="hangsqa"><em>The years of payments.</em> The questions involved here are, “What is the maturity date of the loan?” and “Over how many years will the loan be amortized?” The first of these questions indicates how many years of principal and interest payments you will have to make. Make sure that the project being financed will achieve its potential before the maturity date of the loan. Also, if the project is expected to achieve a positive cash flow in three years, where will the company get the cash it needs to make the required payments in the first and second years? Payments must be scheduled (read minimized) in such a way that they are very low in the early years and then increase in the later years. This permits the loan to be repaid with the cash flows generated by the project itself. If the maturity and the number of years of amortization are not the same, a balloon payment will be required, as mentioned previously.</p>
<p class="hangsqa"><em>Fees, compensating balances, and restrictions.</em> Incorporate all fees into the loan. That saves cash for the project and postpones the payments over the life of the loan. Remember that a compensating balance reduces the amount that is actually available for the project.</p>
<p class="hangsqa"><em>Collateral.</em> Keep it to a minimum. Try not to pledge all of your assets. Doing so restricts your future flexibility and creates greater vulnerability should cash flows not grow as fast as expected. Banks usually have loan/collateral formulas. Find out what these formulas are early in the discussions.</p>
</li>
<li>When negotiating, use your banker as an adviser. Her advice is free, and she is often very knowledgeable. Bankers’ <a id="page_254"></a>conservatism serves as a protective mechanism. Your company has needs and will make substantial profits after your project succeeds. The bank has needs, as well. However, its upside profitability is limited to the interest rate it can achieve on the loan.</li>
<li>Learn how to use the amortization schedule. An example follows:</li>
</ol>
<table class="taba">
<tr>
<td>Loan Amount</td>
<td>$100,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Time to Pay</td>
<td>5 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interest Rate</td>
<td>8.5%</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="para">The monthly payment will be $2,051.65. Total payments over the 60 months will be $123,099, broken down as follows:</p>
<table class="taba">
<tr>
<td>Principal</td>
<td>$100,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interest</td>
<td style="text-decoration:underline;">    23,099</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total</td>
<td>$123,099</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="para">The payments during the first two years will be mostly interest. In fact, after the first year, the amount of principal still owed will be more than $83,000.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The number of years of amortization can be more critical to success than the actual interest rate. If the same $100,000 loan has an interest rate of 9.5 percent (100 basis points or 1 percentage point higher) but is for a seven-rather than a five-year term, the monthly payment will be reduced to $1,634.40. To improve cash flows during the early years, a higher interest rate but a longer term will be beneficial.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Consider a twenty-year amortization with a seven-year balloon. This means that the monthly payments of principal and interest are calculated as if this were a twenty-year loan. If this loan had a 10 percent interest rate, the monthly payment would be reduced to $965.02. What this means, however, is that after seven years, the principal amount will still be $84,072.45, and this balloon payment will be due at that time. This could be dangerous if the company has the cash to repay the loan in the early years <a id="page_255"></a>but diverts the funds to other uses rather than preparing to repay. When the balloon comes due, the company’s negotiating power will be limited or nonexistent. The best strategy might be to arrange the twenty-year amortization and then begin to prepay after a year or two. The company can also prearrange a schedule of two years of reduced payments and then extra payments for years three through seven, after which the loan will be fully paid off.</p>
