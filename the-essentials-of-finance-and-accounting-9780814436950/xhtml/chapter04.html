<h2 class="h2b"><a id="rchap04"></a>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles: A Review and Update</h2>
<p class="para"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he role of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was briefly described in the introduction. This is a research organization, made up primarily of accountants. The FASB, along with the entire accounting profession, has, over time, developed a series of rules called <em>generally accepted accounting principles</em> (GAAP). In addition, the FASB publishes what are called <em>FASB Bulletins.</em> These are a series of more than one hundred publications that describe what corporate reporting methodologies should be. Most of these methodologies have been adopted and are now incorporated into accounting practice. A broad analogy is that the GAAP rules are the basic constitution and the bulletins are proposed amendments. Here are some of the fundamental GAAP rules.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_83"></a><a id="rchap04_sub1"></a>The Fiscal Period</h3>
<p class="para">All reporting is done for predetermined periods of time. Reports may be issued for months or quarters, and certain reports are issued covering annual periods. Accounting fiscal periods usually coincide with calendar periods, although not necessarily with the calendar year. A few companies define their fiscal month as 28 days and their calendar year as 13 of those months. Other companies adopt a <em>fiscal year</em> of, say, July 1 to June 30 (possibly to make the year-end tax season easier) or February 1 to January 31 (to include the Christmas selling season). Municipal governments time their fiscal years to begin three months after the beginning of the fiscal years of their respective state governments. This gives the municipality three months to determine how much state aid they will receive from the state prior to the deadline of the municipal government. State governments in turn time their fiscal year to begin three months after the federal fiscal year. Similarly, this provides the state with three months to learn what federal aid will be available prior to the deadline for the state budget.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap04_sub2"></a>The Going Concern Concept</h3>
<p class="para">When accountants are keeping the books and preparing the financial statements, they presume that the company will continue to exist for the foreseeable future. If there is serious doubt about this, or if the company’s ceasing operations is a certainty, the financial statements (essentially the balance sheet) will be presented at estimated liquidation value. If the company is in serious financial trouble and its future existence is in doubt, the outside CPA firm, as part of its audit process, is required to comment on this financial condition in its certification letter to shareholders. It must make a concrete statement in which this concern is explicitly expressed.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap04_sub3"></a>Historical Monetary Unit</h3>
<p class="para">Accounting is the recording of <em>past</em> business events in dollars (or in the currency of the country in which it is domiciled). In the <a id="page_84"></a>United States, financial statements, and in fact all financial accounting, report only in dollars. While units of inventory, market share, and employee efficiency (such as revenue per employee) are critical business issues, reporting on them is not within the realm of financial accounting responsibility.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Financial statements depicting past years are presented as they occurred. The selling prices of the products and the value of assets may very well be different today, but reports of past periods are not adjusted to reflect current economic conditions.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap04_sub4"></a>Conservatism</h3>
<p class="para">The principle of conservatism requires that “bad news” be recognized when the condition becomes possible and the amount can be estimated, whereas “good news” is recognized only when the event (transaction) has actually occurred.</p>
<p class="para-ind">One example of this is the <em>allowance for bad debts</em> on the balance sheet, which is recorded before the losses are actually incurred. It is recognized that some of the company’s accounts receivable may not be collected. The total amount of uncollectible accounts receivable is estimated and the allowance is recorded before the company finds out which customers (if any) actually will not pay their bills. Another example is reserves for inventory writedowns, which are recorded before the dated or out-of-style products are actually put up for sale at distress prices. It is clear on December 26 that any remaining Christmas items will have to be sold at deeply discounted prices. The writedown is recorded on December 26, not when the items are actually put on sale. Revenue, however, is not recorded, no matter how certain its receipt may seem from a business point of view, until the product is actually delivered or the service is actually provided to the customer. Payment in advance, while increasing the certainty of the sale in a business sense, does not change the accounting rule. Revenue is recorded only when it is earned.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_85"></a><a id="rchap04_sub5"></a>Quantifiable Items or Transactions</h3>
<p class="para">In a business sense, the value of the company’s workforce and the knowledge that the employees possess may be the company’s critical competitive advantage. However, because that value cannot be quantified and expressed in dollar amounts, accounting does not recognize it as an asset. The value of trademarks and franchise names is also generally not included. Coke, Windows, and Disney are certainly franchise names with worldwide recognition. While the business value of a franchise name can be almost infinite if it is maintained, the name is not an asset on the balance sheet because its value cannot be quantified.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap04_sub6"></a>Consistency</h3>
<p class="para">Accountants make many decisions when preparing a company’s financial statements. These include, but are not limited to, the choice of depreciation method for fixed assets and the choice of LIFO or FIFO accounting for inventory. Once these decisions have been made, however, each successive set of financial statements must employ the same methodology. When a major change in accounting methodology is made, the accountants must highlight that change and redo past financial statements (the reference points) to reflect it. Only then can comparative analysis and trends be valid. We don’t want an analysis of two successive sets of financials to be distorted because of changes in accounting methodology. Also if the accounting methodology of the prior year (the reference point) has been changed, right on the top of those numbers it will say “restated.” If the changes are significant (material), there will probably also be a footnote with a fuller explanation of the changes.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap04_sub7"></a>Full Disclosure</h3>
<p class="para">When a major change in accounting methodology occurs, accountants must take steps to be certain that the readers of the financial <a id="page_86"></a>statements are fully aware of that change and how it affected the financial results.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap04_sub8"></a>Materiality</h3>
<p class="para">An event that is material, or significant, is one that may affect the judgment, analysis, or perception of the reader of the information. Events that are perceived as <em>material</em> must be disclosed separately and highlighted accordingly. This is a relative concept. Something that is significant in a company with annual revenues of $20 million might be largely irrelevant in a multibillion-dollar enterprise.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap04_sub9"></a>Significant Accounting Issues</h3>
<p class="para">There are some major accounting issues that all businesspeople should know about.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">The Sarbanes-Oxley Act</h4>
<p class="para">This legislation was passed by the U.S. Congress in 2002. A number of accounting scandals, most notably that involving the infamous Enron, caused government officials and the accounting profession to reexamine how accounting is done, the concept of the audit process, and corporate governance. The act was named after its sponsors, Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland and Congressman Michael Oxley of Ohio. Many improvements in corporate governance have occurred since 2002. Some were specifically required by Sarbanes-Oxley; others reflected the purpose of the legislation. Among these improvements are:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company must sign a letter certifying that the contents of the annual report are true and that they take full responsibility for those contents. This letter is included in the annual report. They also must certify that the company’s internal controls are effective in ensuring that the contents of the annual report are true and the financial statements <a id="page_87"></a>are accurate. Ignorance of deception is no longer an option for those responsible. “I didn’t know” is no longer an acceptable defense in any legal or regulatory matter.</li>
<li>The concept of transparency has become increasingly important. The company must tell the readers of the annual report more of what they need to know about the company and its financial condition. In particular, the existence of <em>off-balance sheet financing</em> must be revealed and discussed.</li>
<li>The management of the board of directors has been improved. The audit committee of the board is responsible for overseeing the efforts of the outside accounting firm. At least one member of that committee (and hopefully more than one) must have a background as a certified public accountant (CPA). This seems so obvious now. How can a committee provide intelligent oversight of a CPA firm when no one on the committee has any background in that business?</li>
<li>It has long been a practice that the audit firm is selected by the shareholders, not the board of directors and not senior management. If you own stock in a company, you receive a notice of the annual meeting as well as the opportunity to vote for the election or reelection of members of the board of directors. Also included in this package, which is called a “proxy statement,” is the opportunity to vote for or against the outside audit firm. While there is no choice among possible alternatives, there is at least the opportunity to vote against the incumbent firm if enough shareholders are not happy with their performance. Understand that switching CPA firms is very expensive and disruptive. But in the past few years, firms have been replaced.</li>
<li>The compensation committee of the board of directors must consist of only outside, independent directors. No employees may serve on this committee. Previously, there had been situations where subordinates would approve the compensation and bonus packages of their boss or two <a id="page_88"></a>coworkers would mutually agree to each other’s compensation.</li>
<li>One of the major criticisms of boards of directors was, and to some extent still is, that the members did not really pay close enough attention to the management of the company. They were friends of the chairman and didn’t want to be critical, or they were too busy with their main jobs or with their work on many other boards. Some businesspeople are career board members and serve on seven or more boards. It has become clear, based upon many boards that were not doing their jobs, that some board members cannot possibly provide adequate attention to all of their responsibilities. As a result of some provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and also shareholder activism, many board members are being forced to resign or are not being nominated for reelection and thus are allowed to disappear from the scene gracefully.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4a">“Safe Harbor” Provision</h4>
<p class="para">This is officially called the <em>Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</em> What this legislation does is protect the CEO and the company from legal liability resulting from statements made to the public that turn out to be incorrect if the statements were made in good faith, based upon what was known at the time.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Many public companies conduct or participate in public forums with security analysts and shareholders. Every three months, there is one of these forums, usually in the form of a conference call, which may be “attended” by thousands of telephone participants and listeners. Every owner of the company’s shares may listen in (schedules can be found on the company’s website). During this meeting, the CEO will make pronouncements about the company’s future, which includes “guidance,” or a forecast of the company’s expected revenue and net income growth. Under this act, if the CEO projects 15 percent profit growth and the amount actually achieved is 10 percent or 20 percent, the CEO cannot be accused of hiding the truth if the forecast was made in good faith, based <a id="page_89"></a>upon what was known at the time the forecast was presented. This does not preclude the fact that many shareholders will sell their shares if the CEO’s forecasts do not prove credible.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The following statement, or something similar, appears in many annual reports. This particular statement is a direct quote on the subject from the 2014 annual report of the Walt Disney Company (page 54):</p>
<p class="block1">… We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking” including statements made in this report and other filings with the SEC and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements, for example, express expectations or projections about future action that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass.</p>
<p class="para">Disney goes on to list and explain all of the possible risks that conceivably could adversely affect their company and its performance. Basically it is saying, “We do the best we can but cannot predict the future or any extraneous events with total accuracy and take no responsibility to do so.”</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Fair Value Accounting</h4>
<p class="para">The economic and financial turmoil and crisis during the 2008– 2012 period has been beyond the imagination and anticipation of most businesspeople, government regulators, and the general public. The uncertainty, business dislocation, and financial loss have caused damage that is estimated to be in the trillions of dollars. One of these areas of financial uncertainty involved the actual value of the assets on a company’s books. The focus was on assets <a id="page_90"></a>owned by banks, particularly marketable securities. The solvency of many banks, and maybe the entire financial system, depended on a rational determination of these values.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Realizing this problem at the very beginning of the financial crisis, the FASB created SFAS No. 157, <em>Fair Value Measurements.</em> This provides a more standardized methodology that banks (and others) are to use to value marketable securities on their balance sheets. The rules establish the definition of market value as “an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset … in an orderly transaction between market participants.”</p>
<p class="para-ind">The rules also provide for three classifications of assets. This methodology allows the reader to have a strong sense of the logic that the company used to value its assets. These classifications are:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li><em>Level 1.</em> Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are available. Think of a quote for a New York Stock Exchange–listed public company.</li>
<li><em>Level 2.</em> There is available information about prices for identical assets. However, there may not be an actual quote.</li>
<li><em>Level 3.</em> No direct quotes or information is available to value these assets.</li>
</ul>
