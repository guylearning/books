<h2 class="h2b"><a id="rchap05"></a>The Annual Report and Other Sources of Incredibly Valuable Information</h2>
<p class="para"><span class="dropcap">E</span>very analyst and business professional should be intimately acquainted with the information available in the public domain that he can access and use for a variety of purposes. The sources discussed here will include:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>The annual report</li>
<li>The 10K report to the Securities and Exchange Commission</li>
<li>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em></li>
<li><em>Forbes</em> and <em>Fortune</em> magazines and their websites</li>
<li>The Public Register Annual Report Service (PRARS)</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">There is an enormous amount of valuable information available that everyone should be aware of. Much of it is free and readily accessible on the Internet.</p>
<h4 class="h4a"><a id="page_92"></a><a id="rchap05_sub1"></a>The Annual Report</h4>
<p class="para">The annual report should be read for the many valuable insights that it provides:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>It is a wonderful review of the accounting process and the concept of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).</li>
<li>You can learn a great deal about your own company from its annual report. This includes how it perceives itself strategically and ethically and how it presents itself to the rest of the world.</li>
<li>The information contained in your competitors’ annual reports provides valuable insights into their financial condition, performance, and strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">Every company whose stock is traded freely by shareholders is called a <em>public company.</em> According to the various securities laws passed by Congress in the 1930s and amended many times since, any company with at least 500 shareholders who can vote their own shares independently is considered public and is subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. There are many private companies that provide shares to their employees through a 401(k) or similar plan. However, because the company, not the employee “owners” of the shares, votes those shares in trust, the company maintains its private status.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Not all companies are subject to SEC regulation—only those whose shares are registered and publicly traded. Company size is not an issue here. Some very large (multibillion-dollar) companies are private, and some very small companies have publicly traded shares.</p>
<p class="para-ind">There are three essential themes in the annual report. It is a combination of a regulatory requirement, a public relations vehicle, and what we’ll call the middle ground: strong tradition. Many companies include information in their annual report that is not specifically required. However, because that information has historically <a id="page_93"></a>been presented every year, it becomes expected, and its omission would raise question.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The pure public relations aspect of the annual report includes all photographs and presentations that convey the company’s public image, its reputation as a good corporate citizen, and product promotion. The corporate self-promotion effort begins on the outside cover. Here are some sample statements from recent annual reports:</p>
<p class="para-ind"> </p>
<table style="font-size:0.82em;">
<tr>
<td>Global Growth and Industry Leadership</td>
<td>(Halliburton)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Growing from Within</td>
<td>(United Technologies)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Improving Health for Life</td>
<td>(BioSante)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lasting Solutions</td>
<td>(Artes Medical)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Accelerating Our Growth</td>
<td>(Endo Pharmaceuticals)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Building on the Elements of Success</td>
<td>(Sepracor)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Investing in People and Product Success</td>
<td>(Sciele Pharma Inc.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Forces for Life</td>
<td>(Sanofi Aventis)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="para-t1">All of these reports (which are only a minute sample of those available) have photographs of people whose health has been improved or whose lives were saved, of beautiful construction projects that the company has completed, or of the technologically advanced products that the company has provided.</p>
<p class="para-ind">These are announcements to:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>The public.</em> Science, engineering, and helping people provide a positive image.</li>
<li><em>The company’s employees.</em> Their company is in the forefront as a “knowledge” company. This emphasizes their value to the company (despite the millions who were laid off over the years).</li>
<li><em>Security analysts.</em> Science companies are very attractive to investors. Companies that used to do R&amp;D and then manufacture their products are now outsourcing much of their production. Fast-growth, high-margin scientific research <a id="page_94"></a>and development is much more attractive to the investment world than manufacturing. The stock of a company that was previously a manufacturer will perform better if the security analysts and investors know of and believe in its repositioning strategy. Science and engineering will improve the company’s image in the investment community, which will assign a higher price / earnings ratio to its stock. Security analysts like a high-margin, fast-growth company with recession-resistant special products. If the company is relatively small, it becomes a takeover candidate. Biotech companies that outsource “mundane” manufacturing sell at much higher price/earnings ratios than companies known as “old pharma.” </li>
</ol>
<p class="para-ind">The inside cover provides a highlights section. Many companies merely repeat such themes as science, fast growth, helping people, and similar cliches. Other companies get more serious and include summary financial information from the income statement and balance sheet, and also stock market data—earnings per share and stock prices. For example, DuPont spends over $1 billion per year in research and development and averages more than $5 billion per year in capital expenditures and acquisitions of other companies. It is (and wants us to know that it is) dedicated to knowledge and is a modern and efficient business.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">The CEO’s Letter to Shareholders</h4>
<p class="para">The chief executive officer (CEO) is required to write a letter to shareholders. This letter includes a description and analysis of all business events of the past year that have had a significant (read “material” ) impact on the performance and condition of the company. It also includes considerable commentary on how the company sees its future.</p>
<p class="para-ind">This letter is reviewed as part of the audit process. It must present all issues in an even-handed manner. Negative as well as positive events must be presented in a logical, cohesive way so that the <a id="page_95"></a>reader will learn useful information. Bad news is often presented early in this letter so that the positive corrective actions that are already in process can be described. The company wants to convey the idea that management is on top of things and knows what has to be done. Management’s credibility is at stake.</p>
<p class="para-ind">In a classic letter written a few years ago by GE’s CEO, Jeffrey Immelt, he was very blunt, honest, and even intimate. It begins, “Dear Fellow Owners,” not the then-standard “Dear Stockholder.” Immelt’s personal net worth declined by many millions of dollars as a result of the stock market crash of 2008–2009. So did the wealth of all GE shareholders. When the stock had declined by 50 percent during this period, Immelt bought more shares as a show of confidence. That particular investment cost him vast sums until the market turned positive in March 2009. In his letter, Immelt added, “In the past, I believed that our diversified portfolio would protect us in all kinds of economic cycles. But we never anticipated a global financial system failure and its continuing economic fallout.” The stock of GE is up over 400 percent since that time. GE drastically reduced its exposure to financial investments by severely downsizing the operations of GE Capital, which was one of the largest financial entities in the country at its peak. Unfortunately, GE has replaced some of that investment in energy-related products, which as of 2015 are struggling because of the price of oil and the European recession.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Despite these cycles, GE is one of the most successful companies of the past 30 years. Its stated strategy is classic:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Be global.</li>
<li>Drive innovation.</li>
<li>Build relationships.</li>
<li>Leverage strengths.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">GE is among the last of the true conglomerates; its portfolio includes aircraft engines, energy products, and appliances. It has sold its TV stations. Its strategy is to operate as the number one or number two company in each industry or to exit the business. GE <a id="page_96"></a>Capital has been greatly downsized and will ultimately be only a very small part of the overall business.</p>
<p class="para-ind">These letters to the shareholders are generally written by a team whose profession is described as “financial public relations” or “investor relations.” This internal team, supported by outside consultants, is responsible for all phases of GE’s relationship with its investors and others who are interested in its financial performance, including the annual report presentation, shareholders’ meetings, security analysts’ meetings, and general communications. The letter is audited by the company’s outside CPA firm to assure its compliance with GAAP, its accuracy, and its fairness.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Public Relations</h4>
<p class="para">Large companies like GE, Verizon, and Johnson &amp; Johnson have a multitude of interlocking constituencies. The stockholders, who often include employees and their pension funds, are the voters who elect the board of directors, which in turn appoints the officials responsible for regulatory issues, including taxes, corporate governance, and relationships with government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The annual report is also a presentation to the company’s customers, some of whom may also be stockholders. Some of these customers may also be government agencies. GE and other companies want to influence the way they are viewed by the world. To accomplish this, they devote a considerable portion of their annual report to a description of each of their businesses. The Johnson &amp; Johnson annual report, for example, contains a very effective presentation of its businesses, including financials, easy-to-understand charts, and photographs of happy people, including patients whose health is improving, happy employees, and so on. (You get the picture.) The photographs want to convey to the world that the employees are “just people,” building shareholder value by helping “other people.” The choice of photographs (and the decision to include them at all) is motivated by public relations considerations and supports the image and message that the company is presenting.</p>
<p class="para-ind"><a id="page_97"></a>Going back in history to a letter that was composed with great skill, we look at the CEO letter in Disney’s 1999 annual report. This letter provides some interesting perspectives. It is addressed to “Disney Owners and Fellow Cast Members.” Employees of all Disney theme parks are known as cast members. This letter indicates that this company holds those cast members in very high esteem. It presents, in a very direct manner, some very pointed themes.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Revitalize underperforming areas (home video and consumer products).</em> Right up front, the letter describes an issue in cliché terms, then identifies the focus of the comment. Disney is focusing on some specific issues that need to be addressed and wants us to know that it knows what these priorities are. Notice, also, that bad news is presented first, followed by a lengthy discussion of remedial actions that are currently in progress.</li>
<li><em>Achieve greater profitability from existing assets (control costs).</em> The letter describes the need for greater efficiency and indicates that the company does not need to remain in all its current businesses forever. The company’s strategic sourcing program means more pricing and service cooperation from vendors who seek to continue in that capacity.</li>
<li><em>Capital efficiency initiatives to drive long-term growth (how best to invest).</em> Disney has included outside partners in many of its ventures and to some extent is becoming a theme park management company. This provides more focus on and cash from its core competencies. This is particularly true in its Paris Disneyland and the even newer theme park in China. Disney partners with local companies to help it cross political and cultural barriers.</li>
<li><em>Continued product development (being Disney).</em> Disney is an entertainment company that is quite successful in its cross-branding strategy. Its parks, cruises, movies, TV and cable, and consumer products mostly carry the Disney brand and cross-sell each other.</li>
</ol>
<p class="para-ind">A review of Disney’s annual reports over the past 10 years suggests that the company continues to emphasize the same themes. <a id="page_98"></a>During the 2009–2010 time period, it purchased Marvel Entertainment, which owns approximately five thousand trademarked cartoon characters. This added the content of these characters to the Disney distribution network. Prior to that it purchased Pixar Studios from Steve Jobs. Jobs, at the time of his death, was the largest shareholder of Disney beyond the Walt Disney family. It has also purchased the Star Wars franchise (Lucas Films) and will begin to market the “package” in 2015. The “package” will probably include movies, products, and theme park events.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Management Discussion and Analysis</h4>
<p class="para">Traditionally, this section of the annual report provides an extensive, somewhat detailed review of the past year. In paragraph form, the company discusses its financial results in considerable detail. For example, DuPont presents considerable information about the results of each of its business units. This is referred to as <em>segment reporting</em>. The Warren Buffett letter in the Berkshire Hathaway annual report is a classic in his analysis of the economy and the performance of almost every individual company in its portfolio. He goes into great detail on the performance of individual executives. Know that BH owns Heinz, Geico, and many other well-known companies.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Many years ago, when companies diversified into somewhat unrelated businesses, it became difficult for analysts to benchmark these companies against their competitors because their business identity was difficult to determine. The result was a requirement that a company include in its annual report financial information for each of its business segments. The accounting document that specifically required this information is called <em>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information</em>. Companies’ resistance to providing this information resulted from their desire to avoid providing competitors with valuable information. Companies are very careful in defining each of their segments because of the information about each segment that they must provide. While <a id="page_99"></a>segment reporting provides only summary information, that information is competitively valuable.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Disney is one of the most successful companies in the 2012– 2016 time period. Its revenues are growing in excess of 8 percent annually and its stock price has almost tripled (thank you, Walt). It reports revenue and operating income for each of its segments. These include:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Media Networks <em>(including ESPN, ABC, and the Disney channels)</em></li>
<li>Parks and Resorts <em>(at full capacity in 2014)</em></li>
<li>Studio Entertainment <em>(Marvel, Pixar, Lucas, Disney)</em></li>
<li>Consumer Products <em>(retail stores, products in their theme parks)</em></li>
<li>Interactive <em>(websites, streaming TV)</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">DuPont has drastically redefined its identity and its segments over the years. It used to be “DuPont Chemical Company.” It has become crisp, brisk, in-your-face-modern “Dupont.” By following the reporting of its segments, we can see that DuPont has divested itself of commodity business, sold off its less important sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, in which it was a minor player. All of its current businesses are high-value-added, science-oriented products.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Segment reporting information may appear either in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of the annual report or buried deep in the report’s footnotes. Wherever in the annual report it is located, it will usually provide information on revenues, operating income, assets, and capital expenditures for each segment. Much of this information is broken down by geography. Many companies will provide an assessment of the future strategies for each business and possibly include a financial forecast. Some, but very few, will reveal the risk-adjusted hurdle rate that they use to evaluate capital expenditures. The significance of this is discussed in <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a> of this book, “Return on Investment.”</p>
<p class="para-ind"><a id="page_100"></a>There are a few very effective ways to use this information. Acquire the annual reports of:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li><em>Your competitors.</em> In their annual reports, these companies will reveal some of their future expectations and (surprisingly) identify and describe specific ongoing projects and strategic alliances. Their segment financials are a wonderful source of benchmark information. Observation of any year-to-year redefinitions of the segments may reveal changing strategic directions.</li>
<li><em>Your suppliers.</em> In their reports, these companies may reveal their managements’ perceptions of future sales. Your company is one of their customers. So they are in fact identifying what they think you will buy, in terms of quantities, technologies, and perhaps geography. The airline industry’s forecast of new planes needed becomes a guideline to GE for the number of engines it may sell, to Alcoa for how much aluminum it may sell, and to Honeywell for the sales of cockpit electronics that it may enjoy.</li>
<li><em>Your customers.</em> Their forecasts and strategic direction may translate to your forecasts and strategic direction, as well. Technological advances may define new generations of products. Consider Dell Computer with “Intel (computer chips) Inside,” or the advances in the Internet driving sales of cell phones.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4a">“Safe Harbor” Provision</h4>
<p class="para">For the company as a whole and for each segment, the annual report provides a considerable amount of information about the company’s expectations for the future. This part of the report is called an “outlook.” Management must be very careful about this presentation. It might cause existing and potential stock market investors to make decisions about their investments in the company that could have an undesirable outcome. If this discussion is handled correctly, the company cannot be blamed for this because <a id="page_101"></a>it is not giving advice; it is merely presenting management’s assessment of the future.</p>
<p class="para-ind">As discussed in <a href="chapter04.html">Chapter 4</a>, many companies provide a disclaimer statement for this outlook, carefully stating that they cannot be held responsible for the outlook’s accuracy. They can thus protect themselves from liability resulting from statements made by senior management. We saw this in Disney’s statement in <a href="chapter04.html">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p class="para-ind">One of the most honest and revealing statements was provided by GE in its annual report a few years back. It viewed its past performance and its expectations for the future in a very explicit manner. It was able to do this legally because of the protection of the safe harbor provision. The company was very even-handed in discussing its weaknesses as well as its strengths. Without this provision, the annual report would become a totally compliance-focused document with much less valuable information and would have provided no sense of the company’s future. Imagine the politics and legal issues that would arise if the company had to publish its budget. The lawsuits would be unwieldy if the company didn’t make its numbers. The legal situation might even be worse if actual performance exceeded budgeted projections. Therefore, management simply discusses the company’s future in general terms and is protected from litigation when it does so. No forecast numbers are provided, and rightly so. Only strategies and issues are included in the discussion.</p>
<p class="para-ind">GE provides the following in its 2008 annual report:</p>

<h4 class="h4a">Report of Independent Accountants</h4>
<p class="para">This is a letter written by the company’s outside accounting firm. It is addressed to the stockholders of the company, to whom the <a id="page_102"></a>accounting firm reports, and sometimes also to the board of directors. When the company sends out the notice of the annual meeting, it will include a proxy statement that identifies the major issues that will be decided by shareholder vote at the annual meeting. If a shareholder does not attend the meeting, that shareholder’s vote is not sacrificed. Rather, the shareholder may vote by “proxy.” (This essentially means that the shareholder may vote over the Internet or by mail.) One issue that always appears on the proxy statement is whether the stockholders approve (or not) of the board of directors’ recommendation to renew the contract of the outside CPA firm. The vote almost always confirms the board’s recommendation. No alternative CPA firm is named. However, in circumstances where there have been extreme problems with the audit process or with accounting integrity, the stockholders, through this somewhat democratic process, do have the ability to discontinue the CPA firm’s services.</p>
<p class="para-t1"><strong><em>The Audit Process.</em></strong> The company’s internal accounting staff is responsible for keeping the books and producing the financial statements. Larger companies have an organization called internal audit that is separate from the accounting staff and, to some degree, reviews the accounting staff’s work. In some cases, the audit staff may not be part of the controller’s organization at all. The 2006 annual report of United Technologies is a classic. It describes the role of internal auditors and the internal control process very well:</p>
<p class="block1">The management of UTC is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, <a id="page_103"></a>internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Management has assessed the effectiveness of UTC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control. (p. 50)</p>
<p class="para">This letter is signed by all of the key UTC executives: the CEO, COO, vice president of finance, and vice president of accounting and finance.</p>
<p class="para-ind">While these internal auditors are employees of United Technologies, they function as surrogates for the outside CPA firm and support the external auditing efforts. UTC’s outside CPA firm is PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP. With the demise of Arthur Andersen, PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG have become the dominant CPA firms. These are both multinational CPA firms with offices in most parts of the world and thousands of partners.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Auditors ensure that transactions were recorded correctly. They verify the accuracy of the financial statements and the many estimates that were made by management. All publicly traded companies in the United States are required to have their financial statements audited. Most large private companies have their financial statements audited, as well. This process is becoming global, as it facilitates international transactions and ventures.</p>
<p class="para-t1"><strong><em>The Letter.</em></strong> The CPA firm writes a letter to the stockholders. Most companies’ letters are the same, but they reveal some very interesting information about the accounting process. Here is a standard letter:</p>
<p class="block1">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of ABC Company … and related consolidated statements of income, retained earnings … and cash flows for each of the three years…. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our <a id="page_104"></a>responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based upon our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management.</p>
<p class="para-ind">This letter has some very interesting features that provide insights into the accounting and audit processes. The first sentence makes the CPA firm’s role very clear: It audited. The next statement confirms that the ABC Company is responsible for the numbers. The CPA firm expresses an <em>opinion</em> on the financial statements. This is a very simple term that has been the subject of an incredible amount of controversy over the years. The letter does not refer to a warranty, fact, or guarantee. That is why this letter is often called “the opinion letter.” The CPA firm uses the term <em>assurance</em> later in the letter, just to reinforce its role.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Notice that the CPA firm examines the numbers “on a test basis.” The accounting firm does not verify every item in the company’s books. Instead, it takes samples: it selects a certain number of customers to confirm accounts receivable, selects a certain number of vendors to confirm accounts payable, and uses similar measures to confirm payroll, inventory, and all other significant (read material) items. The burden is on the company to prove that assets are listed at the lower of cost or market and that all other accounting principles have been adhered to.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The last statement in the letter confirms that the financials reflect <em>estimates.</em> Depreciation expense is based upon the estimated number of years that the machinery will last. Reserve for bad debts is an estimate, or projection of the portion of the accounts receivable that will not be collected. The pension fund calculation is <a id="page_105"></a>based upon projections of how much money employees will have earned when they retire and how many employees will be eligible. These numbers are based on the best available information, but they are all nonetheless estimates.</p>
<p class="para-ind">After all of the accounting and auditing work has been done, the CPA firm will provide one of three responses. An <em>unqualified opinion</em> really means an opinion without qualification or reservation. It indicates that the company being audited has done a very good job in keeping its books and preparing its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p class="para-ind">A <em>qualified opinion</em> means that everything is fine, with one exception. The company and the CPA are generally in agreement, but they have “agreed to disagree” on one aspect of the presentation. This is usually an interpretation of a GAAP issue or the accounting for a single business event, such as the purchase or sale of a business. The letter will describe the auditors’ position on the issue in question. If the client company is in serious financial trouble, to the point that its continuance as an ongoing business is in question, the audit letter will also discuss this issue.</p>
<p class="para-ind"><em>No opinion</em> or an <em>adverse opinion</em> results when the accounting books are in such disarray that the auditors cannot confirm the numbers. Control procedures may be poor or absent. Accounting irregularities will certainly trigger this result, as will a pattern of not adhering to GAAP. A major company does not change CPA firms casually. The relationship between the company and the accounting firm has been built up over many years and involves a considerable degree of cooperation and trust. If the CPA firm resigns or is asked to do so, this is usually evidence of severe disagreements over the accounting process or the reporting of results. The sudden, unexpected resignation of the chief financial officer or chief accounting officer (the controller or, in government and certain regulated industries, the comptroller) is often an indicator that something is wrong. Not always, but be alerted. It’s much easier for the CPA firm to reassign accountants than to lose a client if personality or culture is an issue.</p>
<h4 class="h4a"><a id="page_106"></a>Footnotes</h4>
<p class="para">The footnotes to the financial statements are a critical part of the annual report presentation and also contain some useful information:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can learn more about the company’s acquisition, divesture, and strategic alliance efforts. There may be possible clues to the company’s strategic direction. Prices of transactions are sometimes included.</li>
<li>More and more companies are providing an analysis of how they manage the risk associated with being global. This includes currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. Some companies actually include in the annual report documentation of every conceivable risk that they may experience.</li>
<li>We can learn what lines of credit a company has and what interest rates it is paying on debt securities and earning on investments in marketable securities.</li>
<li>Many companies describe the legal, environmental, and regulatory issues that they face. Very interesting information about the tobacco lawsuits of the 1990s appears in Philip Morris’s annual reports of that era.</li>
<li>From the segment reporting section, we can determine the key ratios for each of a company’s businesses. This is an excellent way for you to focus on those segments against which you compete.</li>
<li>Executive compensation and huge severance packages paid to failed executives have frequently been on the front pages of the media during the 2008-2012 era of government bailouts and massive corporate bankruptcies. <a href="http://TheStreet.com">TheStreet.com</a> is a very well known investment research and media company founded by Jim Cramer, famous for his daily stock market show on CNBC. That company’s 2008 annual report actually defines severance packages for key executives, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p class="block2"><a id="page_107"></a>With “Cause”</p>
<p class="block2">Without “Cause” or for “Good Reason”</p>
<p class="block2">Change of Control</p>
<p class="block2">Termination after Change of Control</p>
<p class="block2">Death or Disability</p>
<p class="block2">Non-renewal of agreement</p>
<p class="block-para">The severance compensation ranges from nothing to a full year’s salary, prorated bonus, benefits, and exercise of stock options. The company actually asks the stockholders to vote on the employment contracts of key executives, something that most boards of directors are unwilling to do.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Other Important Information in the Annual Report</h4>
<ol>
<li>Financial and statistical information for five or ten years is often included. This provides a valuable overview of the company’s performance and the consistency of that performance. It is interesting to compare the 10-year history with the behavior of the U.S. and global economies during the same period. This may provide some indication of how economic events have affected the company and how it has dealt with this environment. The Johnson &amp; Johnson annual report provides a wonderful example of this.</li>
<li>A list of the members of the management team and the board of directors is provided. Which executives are invited to join the board may provide an indication of the company’s succession plans. Outside directors who are or were CEOs of other companies may become candidates for the top job at this company if the management team does poorly and an outside perspective is required.</li>
<li>We learn which board members belong to the various board committees. This will enable us to be sure that there is at least one CPA on the audit committee and that there are no full-time employees on the compensation committee.</li>
<li><a id="page_108"></a>Somewhere in the back of the annual report there appears a section with what appears to be routine information. It includes:

<li>The place and time of the annual meeting</li>
<li>How to get a 10-K report</li>
<li>How to contact various departments in the company with questions</li>
<li>Whether the company has dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase programs</li>
<li>How to get additional information</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p class="para-ind">These may not seem like startling bits of information, but gaining the right to receive this information required many years of effort on the part of many people. Company management used to be a “closed club” in many ways. Shareholders had very few rights other than the right to sell their shares if they were not happy with their investment. Over time, however, a group of people known as <em>shareholder activists</em> came into being. It would be reasonable to assume that the management team used much less friendly terms to describe these people. The current group of these instigators are usually hedge fund managers. They are the folks who take large positions in companies, ask for board seats, demand increased dividends and share buybacks, and sometimes even a change in management. For a long-term perspective on this movement, every businessperson should know about the Gilbert brothers, John and Lewis (discussed below).</p>

<h3 class="h3b"><a id="rchap05_sub2"></a>The Gilbert Brothers: The Original Shareholder Activists</h3>
<h4 class="h4a">Background</h4>
<p class="para">If you saw the movie <em>Wall Street</em>, you saw Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko browbeat the board of directors of a multinational company because the directors were arrogant and detached from <a id="page_109"></a>the needs of the stockholders and the company. They were making big salaries and bonuses even though the company was not performing well. There were too many senior executives who were not doing much except consuming time and space. This is not make-believe. In fact, the role was modeled on two real-life people, John and Lewis Gilbert. Everyone who is in business and everyone who is interested in the stock market should know what they did.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">Their Contribution</h4>
<p class="para">The Gilbert brothers were born early in the twentieth century in very financially comfortable circumstances. They dedicated their lives to having fun, making money, and creating an environment in which companies’ boards of directors and senior management were actually accountable to their bosses, the shareholders. They were the original shareholder activists. Among the improvements that they caused or contributed are the following principles:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Members of the board of directors should actually own shares of stock in the company.</li>
<li>Stockholders should receive adequate notice of scheduled annual meetings.</li>
<li>Stockholders should receive audited financial statements before the annual meeting. Previously, meetings had some times been postponed because the financial statements weren’t yet “available.” </li>
<li>Annual meetings should be held in a location that is geographically convenient, so that some shareholders can actually attend. An issue in the Transamerica lawsuit, described later, was that the insurance company held its annual meetings in Delaware rather than in California, where its operations and many of its shareholders were located. The tradition of remote locations for annual meetings has been changed.</li>
<li>Shareholders can present resolutions for shareholder vote. In 1942, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that not only can shareholders present resolutions for a <a id="page_110"></a>vote, but their proposals must be circulated to other shareholders at company expense. The current practice is to include the resolutions in the proxy statement and include management’s recommendation of a vote <em>for</em> or <em>against</em> them.</li>
<li>Shareholders can ask questions at annual meetings and actually expect that these questions will be answered. It was common in the 1930s for annual meetings to be filled with company employees who would shout down any stockholder who made an unfavorable comment. It was Lewis Gilbert’s eviction from an annual meeting that accelerated the brothers’ efforts at reform. He asked a pointed question of the chairman and was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.</li>
<li>Senior managers’ compensation should be related to the profitability of the company. Putting executive pay in the proxy statement had its effect as early as 1937. The chairman of Bethlehem Steel had to take a pay cut after receiving pressure from the Gilberts. The event received headline coverage from <em>Business Week</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. This remains an unresolved issue, however. Million-dollar severance payments to failed CEOs and billions of dollars in bonuses to retain employees of bankrupt companies are still headline news.</li>
<li>Auditors are elected by shareholders, not by management. Auditors should be present at annual meetings to answer shareholders’ questions. The concept of internal auditors who would assure the integrity of the company’s financial information was promoted by Lewis Gilbert as early as the 1930s.</li>
<li>Stockholder proposals are included in proxy statements, as mentioned earlier. In 1945, the Gilbert brothers sued Transamerica Insurance Company because management refused to include in its proxy statement proposals that the Gilberts had made. The judge ruled, “A corporation is run for the benefit of its stockholders and not only for that of its <a id="page_111"></a>managers.” This was a fundamental change in attitude and practice.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">These issues seem somewhat obvious in this modern day of shareholder activism and the availability of seemingly unlimited amounts of information through the Internet. When Lewis and John Gilbert hit their full stride in the 1940s, the opposite was true. They are known to have annoyed more than one board chairman with their questions, stockholder resolutions, and challenges.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">The Effort Continues</h4>
<p class="para">Many years ago, the brothers created a foundation, appropriately called Corporate Democracy, Inc. A team of 10 was organized that travels to many dozens of annual meetings, wherever and whenever they may be held. Meetings that can be reached only after multiple plane rides and car rentals are very rare these days, because of the Gilberts. In addition, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations have increased accountability, and the Internet has vastly expanded the availability of information. However, the effort continues, building momentum for a process that began many years ago.</p>
<p class="para-ind">One of the most significant improvements in shareholder rights relates to a company’s treatment of security analysts, as opposed to those who are “just shareholders.” Companies traditionally invited a select few analysts to very comfortable corporate retreats, where management would share its thoughts about the company’s past performance and its expectations for the future of the business. This would be followed up with conference calls and other forms of communication with these select few. In fact, these analysts were often given information before it was made available to the general public. They could then advise their clients of critical developments before the general public was aware of them. When a public announcement was finally made, the clients of many of these analysts had already traded the stock. To prevent the perception and the fact that the favored few were privy to valuable, otherwise private information, companies now must invite everyone to <a id="page_112"></a>listen in on their conference calls. Major developments, including financial information, are now announced to everyone at the same time, either through a press release or through an SEC filing. All of these improvements in disclosure have come about because of the original shareholder activists.</p>
<p class="para-ind">In reading the list and description of these reforms, you may be thinking, “Are you kidding? These are so obvious.” However, we accept these practices as obvious only because the hard work of many people over a long period of time.</p>
<p class="fimage"><img src="../images/f0112-01.jpg" alt="images" width="431" height="9"/></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap05_sub3"></a>Modern-Day Activists</h3>
<p class="para">There are many contemporary corporate activists who have some similarities to the Gilbert brothers, but in many respects are quite different. John and Lewis Gilbert were not motivated by personal financial gain. It is not certain that they ever gained financially from their efforts. Instead, their focus was on corporate governance, or the management of public companies in ways that would ensure shareholder rights, fairness, and management accountability. The modern group of activists has been motivated by financial gain (many have exceeded a billion dollars in personal worth), yet their efforts have resulted in improved management accountability, better disclosure, and also an enhanced focus on governance.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The current notables include Wilbur Ross, Eddie Lampert, Nelson Peltz, and Carl Icahn. Their approach is to take sizable positions in companies whose assets are worth a lot more than the company’s market capitalization (stock price × number of shares outstanding). With a sizable voting block and sometimes board seats, they force improvements in strategy, sometimes changes in senior management, a general overhaul of how the business operates, and maybe sale of the company. Wilbur Ross gains control of target companies and hires new management teams. Eddie Lampert got control of Sears and Kmart, concluding that the real estate they owned was worth more than the cost of buying a controlling interest in both mammoth companies. Unfortunately, he did this <a id="page_113"></a>just before the real estate bubble burst in 2006, and he is still trying to make his strategy work.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Carl Icahn gained fame with a different approach. He is known as a pioneer of the strategy known as “greenmail” (just like blackmail). He would take large positions in underperforming companies, ridicule management’s performance, and promise to remove the current management after he took control. To get rid of him and protect their jobs, the management would have their company buy back only his shares at a substantial premium to their current value. This diluted the value of most stockholders’ shares, depleted the free cash on the company’s balance sheet, and made Icahn a richer man as he disappeared from the scene. Greenmail made Icahn money while his presence caused major improvements by fearful managers. Carl Icahn did actually manage a business, TWA, for seven years in the late 1980s, and ended up selling its pieces. These days, his interests include Time Warner and Motorola, among many others.</p>
<p class="para-ind">If an activist is someone who identifies bad, underachieving management and causes improvements, then one of the most subtle players is Jim Cramer of the cable network CNBC. His daily stock market show includes a “wall of shame.” On it he highlights CEOs whose companies are performing so poorly that the top person needs to go or as he says, “They need to retire to spend more time with their family.” On his television show, Cramer says that he cannot benefit from the ownership of stock so he is never promoting a strategy for his own benefit.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap05_sub4"></a>The 10-K Report</h3>
<p class="para">The 10-K is an annual report that goes directly to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It contains all of the reports required by regulatory agencies that are contained in the annual report, and more besides. There is no public relations information or photographs. Some 10-K reports contain considerable biographical information about the directors and executives, similar to what is provided in the proxy statement.</p>
<p class="para-ind"><a id="page_114"></a>The 10-K report of an Internet company that had had a series of particularly disappointing years described the future risks that the company faced in continuing in business:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Uncertainties associated with the company’s limited operating history</li>
<li>Operating losses and the potential need for additional funds</li>
<li>Unproven acceptance of the company’s products in a developing market</li>
<li>Dependence on continuing use of the Internet</li>
<li>Reliance on advertising revenues and uncertainty concerning the adoption of the Internet as an advertising medium</li>
<li>Dependence on a limited number of advertisers</li>
<li>Operating in a new and highly competitive market, with low barriers to entry</li>
<li>Variations in quarterly results of operations; seasonality</li>
<li>The need to develop and maintain brand recognition</li>
<li>Dependence on key personnel and a shortage of qualified information technology (IT) people</li>
<li>The strain on the company’s resources as a result of continued growth</li>
<li>Inability to identify potential acquisitions and to integrate operations</li>
<li>Inability to expand and manage international operations</li>
<li>Dependence on content providers</li>
<li>Dependence on strategic alliances</li>
<li>Risk of capacity constraints and systems failures</li>
<li>Online security risks</li>
<li>Inability to protect intellectual property</li>
<li>Liability for informational services</li>
<li>Government regulation</li>
<li>Concentration of stock ownership</li>
<li><a id="page_115"></a>Volatility of stock prices</li>
<li>The antitakeover provisions of Delaware corporate law</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">The full disclosure provisions of GAAP certainly have caused this company to put its cards on the table. It would be helpful if every company were this honest and forthright in assessing its future. The company also described in considerable detail how it was coping with each of these risks. It would be valuable to learn what your company and its competitors identify as the risks that might prevent them from being successful in the future. With full disclosure, the company is also minimizing the risk of lawsuits because the reader has been “warned.”</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap05_sub5"></a>The Proxy Statement</h3>
<p class="para">The proxy statement is the package of information that each shareholder receives as part of the annual meeting announcement. Because most shareholders do not attend the annual meeting, they are invited to vote by “proxy.” This is a mail-in or Internet ballot that is essentially the same as an absentee ballot in national elections. Shareholders get to vote for:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>The annual contract with the CPA firm</li>
<li>Members of the board of directors</li>
<li>Proposals to change the corporate bylaws</li>
<li>Executive stock option and incentive plans</li>
<li>Proposals submitted by shareholders</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-ind">The votes are always yes or no options, and the proxy almost always indicates the vote that is recommended by the board of directors. The proxy package also includes other information that is of great interest:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notification of the fact that a list of all shareholders is available at corporate headquarters and at the annual <a id="page_116"></a>meeting. This is of special interest to shareholder activists like the Gilberts, who seek to arouse interest in a particular issue. It is also valuable to potential acquirers of the company, who need to communicate with shareholders to seek support for their efforts.</li>
<li>A list of the members of the board of directors, their affiliations, and their compensation. Board members may receive an annual retainer, a fee for each board meeting, a fee for each committee meeting, stock options, and deferred compensation. For Fortune 500 companies, this could amount to $100,000 or more annually.</li>
<li>The compensation package for each corporate officer, including deferred compensation and stock options. It is a very positive situation if every director and corporate officer has a stake in the success of the company, and if their rewards are commensurate with that success, or the lack of it.</li>
<li>A description of executive pension and severance packages. There has been considerable negative press concerning departed executives who were paid more for leaving involuntarily than they received when they were employed. The rationale is that their staying with the company would have been more expensive.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap05_sub6"></a>Other Sources of Information</h3>
<p class="para">There are three ways of obtaining a hard copy of an annual report. The first is from the company itself. The second is through a service provided by a company called Public Register. The Public Register Annual Report Service is accessed through Public Register’s website (<a href="http://www.prars.com">www.prars.com</a>). The service provides the annual reports of thousands of companies, for free. The companies in the Public Register database are organized by industry and geography and are alphabetized, so finding the reports you want is easy and convenient. The reports can also be downloaded. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has a similar service.</p>
<p class="para-ind"><a id="page_117"></a>The most comprehensive of these services is Morningstar Reports. Morningstar is a Chicago-based organization that is a leading provider of investment information, research, and analysis. It can easily be accessed through the Internet. For most companies, Morningstar’s website provides:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>A description of the company’s businesses</li>
<li>A listing of its officers</li>
<li>Three years of financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows, in considerable detail</li>
<li>Selected financial ratios segmented by category:</li>
</ul>
<p class="dotted1">• Financial strength</p>
<p class="dotted">• Management effectiveness</p>
<p class="dotted">• Profitability</p>
<p class="para-t1">The management effectiveness ratios include return on equity and return on assets. Profitability ratios include gross profit percentage, operating margin, and return on sales.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The most interesting and helpful section of the report compares the ratios of the subject company with the average ratios for its industry. It is very helpful to use the web pages that provide the ratios of the subject company, industry averages, and the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 companies. The benchmarking value of this information is extraordinary. The ratios are classified into these categories:</p>
<ul class="dmd">
<li>Stock market information including the price/earnings ratio (P/E) and price/cash flow</li>
<li>Growth rates of revenues and earnings</li>
<li>Financial strength</li>
<li>Profitability</li>
<li>Management effectiveness</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p class="para-t1"><a id="page_118"></a>There are approximately 50 ratios. To make the information even more valuable, if that were possible, at the end of the ratios section are the stock symbols of the other companies in the industry database.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><a id="rchap05_sub7"></a>The Securities and Exchange Commission</h3>
<p class="para">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a federal government, executive branch agency responsible to the public for assuring fairness in the securities markets. It was formed by the</p>
<p class="para-ind">Securities Exchange Act of 1934, known as the “truth in securities” law. This law, together with the Securities Act of 1933 that preceded it, requires public companies to provide investors with financial and other significant information about securities that are being offered to the public. These laws also prohibit deceit, misrepresentation, and fraud in the sale of securities.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Companies with assets of at least $10 million whose securities are held by more than 500 independent shareholders are required to file with the SEC. Registration provides the shareholders the information they need if they are to make informed investment decisions. Investors who lose money on their shares can seek to recover damages if they can prove that they based their investment decision on information that was misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate. All SEC filings are available on the Internet at the SEC web-site, <a href="http://www.sec.gov">www.sec.gov</a>.</p>
<p class="para-ind">SEC rules also govern the solicitation of shareholder votes. Proxy statements must be filed with the SEC before the solicitation actually occurs.</p>
<p class="para-ind">Anyone who wishes to make a tender offer for more than <a id="page_119"></a>5 percent of a company’s stock must also file with the SEC. A tender offer is an offer to purchase shares in large quantities. Tender offers are often announced in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in an advertisement called a “tombstone.” Many individuals or companies that anticipate making an unfriendly tender offer (one that the management of the target company is expected to resist) often purchase 4.99 percent of the stock before the event. Once their holdings exceed 5 percent and their intentions become public, the stock price will move up. Therefore, the buyer will keep its holdings below the threshold until as late in the process as possible in order to keep its intentions a secret.</p>
<p class="para-ind">The securities laws also govern the actions of insiders. Anyone who has critical information that is not available to the general public, far beyond just company management, can be perceived as an insider. Insiders may certainly buy and sell shares, but they must notify the SEC of their transactions. This includes accountants, lawyers, secretaries, and even the printer who prints the financial statements. Most stock market websites provide information about management purchases and sales of company stock.</p>
