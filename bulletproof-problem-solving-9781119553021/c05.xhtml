<p id="c05-para-0002">How you go about gathering facts and conducting analysis to test your hypotheses often makes the difference between good and bad problem solving, even when the earlier steps have been followed carefully. Good problem solvers have a toolkit at their disposal that helps them work efficiently, starting with heuristics <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="112" id="Page_112" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>and rules of thumb to understand the <i>direction and magnitudes</i> of relationships that allows them to focus attention on the most important issues. They don't jump right into building giant models until they have a clear understanding of whether and where complex tools are required.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0003">The analysis stage is critical to the objectivity of your problem solving. There are many jokes about torturing the facts until they speak the truth you want to hear. There was even an old <i>New Yorker</i> cartoon that showed a person reaching into a filing cabinet with drawers marked “His facts. Her facts. Your facts.”—and this was well before the advent of fake news. Following a structured problem approach, where we use good analytic techniques to pressure test our hypotheses and good team processes to limit bias, allows us to avoid torturing the facts.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0004">In this chapter, we focus on how to do powerful analyses quickly and efficiently, starting with heuristics, shortcuts, and rules of thumb. We illustrate how you can structure and resolve many analytic issues you face with straightforward heuristics well before any use of the complex “big guns” analysis we introduce in <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</p> </section> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-30"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Heuristics and Rules of Thumb</span></h2>
<p id="c05-para-0005">Heuristics are powerful tools that act as shortcuts in analysis. They help you size the different elements of the problem to determine the efficient path in further analysis. They can be dangerous when incorrectly applied, of course. Author Nicholas Taleb describes how simple rules based on past success can lead you astray in settings where low probability events can produce outsized errors.<a href="#c05-note-0001" id="R_c05-note-0001"><sup>1</sup></a> We'll show you how to avoid these mistakes.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0006">We use the term heuristics, rules of thumb, and shortcuts interchangeably. In <a href="#c05-fig-0001" id="R_c05-fig-0001">Exhibit 5.1</a>, we explore a range of heuristics that are useful for individuals, enterprises, and citizens. When you are asked to list your top 10 songs of all time, it's hard to leave some classics <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="113" id="Page_113" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="114" id="Page_114" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>off the list. So too it is with our top heuristics. We didn't invent them, we just make good use of them and so can you.</p>

<p id="c05-para-0007">The oldest of these is definitely <i>Occam's Razor</i>—favor the simplest solution that fits the facts—which originated in the fourteenth century. It tells us to select the hypothesis that has the fewest assumptions. One way of seeing why this make sense is a simple math example: If you have four assumptions that are independent of each other, with an 80% separate chance of being correct, the probability that all four will be correct is just over 40%. With two assumptions and the same probabilities, it is 64%. For many problems the fewer the assumptions you have the better. Practically speaking, this means avoiding complex, indirect, or inferential explanations, at least as our starting point. Related to Occam's Razor are one‐reason decision heuristics, including reasoning by elimination and <i>a fortiori</i> reasoning, where you eliminate alternatives that are less attractive.<a href="#c05-note-0002" id="R_c05-note-0002"><sup>2</sup></a> The important reminder is not to get committed to a simple answer with few assumptions when the facts and evidence are pointing to a more nuanced or complex answer (remember the availability and substitution biases from <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>).</p>
<p id="c05-para-0008"><i>Order of magnitude</i> analysis is used to prioritize team efforts by estimating the size of different levers. In business problems, we typically calculate the value of a 10% improvement in price, cost, or volume to determine which is more important to focus on (assuming, of course, that each is similarly difficult or easy to change). It applies to analyzing social issues as well. The nursing case in <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> showed the difference in outcomes from improvements in nurse quality and quantity. Doing an order of magnitude analysis should provide a minimum, most likely, and maximum estimate, not simply the maximum. Often the best knock‐out analysis, which we referred to in the previous chapter, is an order of magnitude analysis to show how changes would improve an outcome or make little difference.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0009">Efficient analysis is often helped by the 80:20 rule, sometimes called the <i>Pareto Principle</i> after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="115" id="Page_115" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>first noticed this relationship. It describes the common phenomenon that 80% of outcomes come from 20% of causes. If you plot percent of consumption of a product on the Y‐axis and percent of consumers on the X‐axis you will often see that 20% of consumers account for 80% of sales of a product or service. The point of doing 80:20 analyses is again to focus your analytical effort on the most important factors. Many business and social environments feature market structures where 80:20 or something close to that ratio is the norm, so it's a handy device to use. For example, in healthcare 20% of the population often account for 80% of healthcare costs, a fact that provides huge difficulty for insurance plan‐rating models. The 80:20 rule may also apply in complex system settings. For example, when Rob visited Myanmar in 2016 he learned that only one‐third of the population have access to electricity, yet the country has the potential to produce 100 GW from hydropower. A team explored the trade‐offs between fishery support and hydropower by looking at portfolios of projects on a tributary of the great Irrawaddy River.<a href="#c05-note-0003" id="R_c05-note-0003"><sup>3</sup></a> They showed you could get almost 95% of potential power for a 20% reduction in fishery supports. To achieve 100% of power entailed losses of one half to two‐thirds of fishery support. This extreme version of the 80:20 rule starkly highlights the dilemma for policymakers, in this case between energy, livelihoods, and the environment.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0010"><i>Compound growth</i> is key to understanding how wealth builds, how enterprises scale quickly, and how some populations grow. Warren Buffett said: “My wealth has come from a combination of living in America, some lucky genes, and compound interest.”<a href="#c05-note-0004" id="R_c05-note-0004"><sup>4</sup></a> A really quick way to estimate compounding effects is to use the Rule of 72.<a href="#c05-note-0005" id="R_c05-note-0005"><sup>5</sup></a> The rule of 72 allows you to estimate how long it takes for an amount to double given its growth rate by dividing 72 by the <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="116" id="Page_116" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>rate of growth. So, if the growth rate is 5% an amount will double in about 14 years (72/5 = 14.4 years). If the growth rate is 15%, doubling occurs in four to five years. In a team meeting, Rob asked our research team what a $1000 investment in Amazon would be if you invested at the time of the initial stock offering in 1997. Charles thought about it for about 90 seconds: He tried a low rate of compounding of 5%, where doubling occurs every 14 years, then a high rate of 50% where doubling occurs every 18 months, before settling on $100k. The actual answer is $83k based on a 36% compounding rate, doubling every 2 years. Pretty good with no facts, just the Rule of 72! Where do errors occur with the rule of 72? When there is a change in the growth rate, which of course is often the case over longer periods. This makes sense, as few things continue to compound forever (try the old trick of putting a grain of rice on the first square of a chessboard and double the number on each successive square).</p>
<p id="c05-para-0011">A useful heuristic if you are involved in estimating the adoption rate for a new innovation is the <i>S‐curve</i>, which shows a common pattern of sales with a new product or a new market. S‐curves are drawn with the percent of full adoption potential on the Y‐axis and the years since adoption on the X‐axis. The shape of the S will vary a lot depending on the reference class you select and particular reasons for faster or slower take up in your case. Charles led a successful start‐up in the early days of Internet adoption. At that time, many forecasters overestimated the impact of Internet penetration in the short term (think of Webvan or <a href="http://pets.com">Pets.com</a>), but underestimated adoption in the longer term of 10 to 15 years. It looks in hindsight very clearly to be a classic S‐curve. In 1995 fewer than 10% of Americans had access to the Internet. By 2014 it reached 87%. The S‐curve can take many specific profiles as <a href="#c05-fig-0002" id="R_c05-fig-0002">Exhibit 5.2</a> shows. Like any heuristic, you don't want to apply this rigidly or blindly, but rather use it as a frame for scoping a problem. The challenge is to get behind sweeping statements like “the world has speeded up,” to understand why a particular technology will have adoption at a certain rate.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="117" id="Page_117" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

<p id="c05-para-0012"><i>Expected value</i> is simply the value of an outcome multiplied by its probability of occurring. That is called a single point expected value, but it is usually more useful (depending on the shape of the distribution) to take the sum of all probabilities of possible outcomes multiplied by their values. Expected value is a powerful first‐cut analytic tool to set priorities and reach conclusions on whether to take a bet in an uncertain environment. As an example, in venture capital the goal could be expressed as the desire <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="118" id="Page_118" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>to create a unicorn—a billion‐dollar company. The probability of reaching unicorn status calculated for Silicon Valley in recent years turns out to be 1.28%.<a href="#c05-note-0006" id="R_c05-note-0006"><sup>6</sup></a> The single point expected value is $1 billion times 1.28% or $12.8 million. No wonder many 22 year olds enter risky entrepreneurial ventures against the odds when their next best alternative could be $50k a year working in a call center! But be careful: Single point expected value calculations are most useful when the underlying distribution is normal rather than skewed or long tailed. You check that by looking at the range, and whether the median and mean of the distribution are very different from each other.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0013">When the Australian government research organization CSIRO defended its WiFi intellectual property, it used a simple expected value calculation—but with a difference: It worked backward to the break‐even probability of success, given its estimates of the costs of court action ($10m) and what they would receive if they prevailed ($100m). The decision was made to pursue action in the courts because the board felt the chances of success were greater than an indifference probability of 10% ($100 million expected value of a successful court action divided by legal costs of $10 million). We will see this example more fully in the next chapter.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0014">Much has been made of <i>Bayesian thinking</i> in recent years with books like <i>The Signal and the Noise</i>.<a href="#c05-note-0007" id="R_c05-note-0007"><sup>7</sup></a> Bayesian thinking is really about conditional probability, which is the probability of an event <i>given</i> another event took place which also has a probability, called a <i>prior probability</i>. As a simple example, look at the probability of it raining given that it is cloudy (the prior probability), versus the probability of it raining if it is currently sunny. Rain can happen in either case, but is more likely when the prior condition is cloudy. Bayesian analysis can be challenging to employ formally (as a calculation), because it is difficult to precisely estimate prior probabilities. But we often use Bayesian thinking when we think <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="119" id="Page_119" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>conditional probabilities are at work in the problem. In <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> we look at the <i>Challenger</i> space shuttle disaster in the way a Bayesian statistician would approach the problem of a launch at a temperature not experienced before.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0015"><i>Reasoning by analogy</i> is an important heuristic for quick problem solving. An analogy is when you have seen a particular problem structure and solution before that you think may apply to your current problem. Analogies are powerful when you have the right reference class (that is, have correctly identified the structure type), but dangerous when you don't. To check this, we typically line up all the assumptions that underpin a reference class and test the current case for fit with each. For example, our colleague Professor Dan Lovallo has looked at how you can use reference classes to predict movie revenues.<a href="#c05-note-0008" id="R_c05-note-0008"><sup>8</sup></a> He takes a genre like drama, the presence of well known or little‐known stars, and the budget, and then creates a model based on the reference class of movies to compare with the one to be made. This can be surprisingly accurate and produce results better than a more complex regression model.</p>
<p>There are limits to reasoning by analogy. For example:</p>
<ul id="c05-list-0001">
<li id="c05-li-0001">When traditional business models in retailing, book publishing, and real estate were first challenged by disruptive Internet models, there weren't useful prior analogies to draw on, to explain how the competitive dynamics would play out.</li>
<li id="c05-li-0002">In the liquor market in Australia, a beer company acquired a wine company, reasoning that they were in the alcoholic beverages market and had common customers and distribution requirements. The differences in product range, brand management, customer segments, and working capital requirements meant in practice they had few success factors in common.</li>
<li id="c05-li-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="120" id="Page_120" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Halo effects follow executives who have led turnarounds, assuming that their success will be replicated in new settings. “Chainsaw” Al Dunlap had such a reputation based on a turn‐around at Scott Paper, but was fired in his new role at Sunbeam less than two years into the role.<a href="#c05-note-0009" id="R_c05-note-0009"><sup>9</sup></a></li></ul>
<p id="c05-para-0017"><i>Break‐even point</i>. Every start‐up company Charles and Rob see likes to talk about their cash runway—the months before cash runs out and they need a new equity infusion. Not enough of them really know their break‐even point, the level of sales where revenue covers cash costs. It's a simple bit of arithmetic to calculate, but requires knowledge of marginal and fixed costs, and particularly how these change with increased sales volume. The break‐even point in sales dollars or units equals fixed costs/unit price less unit variable costs. Typically, the unit price is known. You can fairly quickly calculate the costs associated with each sale, the variable costs. The tricky part is how fixed costs will behave as you scale a business. You may face what are called <i>step‐fixed costs</i>, where to double volume involves significant investment in machinery, IT infrastructure, or sales channels. Knowing the break‐even point and cost behavior brings insight about many aspects of a business, as we saw with the Truckgear pricing example in <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0018">As a real‐world example of this, Charles used to ask McKinsey job applicants why car rental firms don't charge your credit card if you don't show up within the 24‐hour window, but hotels do? This is a good example of rule of thumb thinking with high and low fixed cost businesses. It turns out that rental car firms have lower fixed costs and a much higher variable cost percentage than hotels, partly because they pay insurance and a number of other costs in a variable way (unlike regular consumers). Hotels, by contrast, have relatively low variable costs (room cleaning) per customer and large fixed costs. Rental car agencies also face many more substitutes (buses, trains, Uber, taxis) than hotels (Airbnb nowadays, but in the past really just a friend's couch), and experience greater spatial competition in airports (they are much easier to price shop). By using some simple heuristics to understand these differences, you can relatively quickly understand why hotel companies both <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="121" id="Page_121" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>need to charge for no‐shows, and why they have the market power to do so relative to rental car firms.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0019"><i>Marginal analysis</i> is a related concept that is useful when you are thinking about the economics of producing more, consuming more, or investing more in an environment of scarce resources. Rather than just looking at the total costs and benefits, marginal analysis involves examining the cost or benefit of the next unit. In production problems with fixed costs of machinery and plant, marginal costs (again, the cost of producing one more unit) often fall very quickly—favoring more production—up to the point at which incremental machinery is needed. We add units until the marginal benefit of a unit sale is equal to the marginal cost.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0020">We can apply this idea to our hotel problem above. Imagine that the total fixed costs (mortgage, core staff, real estate taxes) of a 200‐room hotel are $10,000 per night, or $50 per room. If a potential guest shows up at 6 p.m. and there is a free room, should the hotel accept his offer of $30 for the night? We know the average cost is $50, but the marginal cost to take one more customer is tiny (probably close to zero, given even cleaning staff are already on duty), so they should take her offer. These economics are what has encouraged new internet businesses in last minute hotels and flights.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0021">Similarly, imagine a business that covers employee healthcare costs is considering subsidizing gym membership, which costs $400 per person.<a href="#c05-note-0010" id="R_c05-note-0010"><sup>10</sup></a> They believe that employees who go to the gym can save the company as much as $1000 per person in healthcare costs, and assume that if they pay a membership the team member will go. Should they do it? You are guessing the answer already: It depends on what percentage of staff members is already paying for their own gym memberships. In this case the marginal analysis tells us the company indifference point is 60% already paying their own way. If fewer make regular use of the gym without subsidy, it makes sense to offer the program (assuming the assumption of use and health benefits holds), but if more are already paying their own way (and getting the company a free benefit from lower health costs), they should spend their benefit budget on something else.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0022"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="122" id="Page_122" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>As a final heuristic, consider the <i>distribution of outcomes</i>. Companies planning large projects often add contingencies of 10% or more for cost overruns, which can run into millions of dollars. Recently we saw data that for infrastructure megaprojects costing $1 billion or more, some 90% go over budget by 20% in the case of roads, and 45% in the case of rail projects.<a href="#c05-note-0011" id="R_c05-note-0011"><sup>11</sup></a> In these cases the expected overspending is not in line with the contingency of 10%, but closer to 30%, almost a full standard deviation higher for cost overruns. These errors are large enough to wipe out the profitability of the projects. Take a look at the distributions shown in <a id="R_c05-fig-0003" href="#c05-fig-0003">Exhibit 5.3</a>.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="123" id="Page_123" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c05-para-0023">We see many common errors that relate to the distribution of outcomes. These include placing too much emphasis on the mean outcome, typically called the base case, and insufficient weight on outcomes that are one or even two standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution. In the case of large projects, asking “Is the worst case bad enough?,” (as Kahneman and his co‐authors put it) when it can turn out to be the true expected case!<a href="#c05-note-0012" id="R_c05-note-0012"><sup>12</sup></a> You have to bring history, analysis, your own experience, and sometimes the experience of others through reference classes, together with judgment to estimate the shape of the project cost distribution. Simulations become a valuable tool to highlight the range of outcomes possible. They are discussed in <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c05-sec-0003"></span>
<h2 id="head-2-31"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Question‐Based Problem Solving</span></h2>
<p id="c05-para-0024">Once you have roughed out the scale and direction of your problem levers by using heuristics, it is time to dig deeper into the analysis. But not all the analysis you will do requires huge number crunching. Often you can get to good understanding and preliminary solutions with a straightforward Sherlock Holmes framework.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0025">We have found that the Sherlock Holmes approach of painting a picture of the problem by asking <b>who, what, where, when, how, and why</b> is a powerful root‐cause tool to quickly focus problem solving. We touched on the powerful role of questions in problem solving in the previous chapter, not simply to clarify the problem under scrutiny but in defining choices and how they are to be evaluated.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0026">As we'll show below, we can often get to rough‐cut solutions in as few as three questions. These examples illustrate the utility of posing simple questions to advance good problem solving. For example, when we were discussing Charles's vote for the school levy in <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, he asked <i>who</i> were the best performing schools, <i>what</i> explained their better student outcomes, and <i>why</i> teaching quality was so important. Three question shortcuts can be represented in <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="124" id="Page_124" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>a decision‐tree format; we show two examples in healthcare, one at the institution level and one at the individual level. The institution example is how hospitals classify heart‐attack patients. The individual example is whether or not to have a knee arthroscopy.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0027"><i>Example: How to classify heart attack patients</i></p>
<p id="c05-para-0028">Hospitals have to make quick decisions to help suspected heart attack victims. What the hospital staff needs to decide is into what category to put incoming heart‐attack patients, whether they are high risk or low risk. High risk requires much closer monitoring and allocation of staff. In a prior study, it was found that hospitals can segregate risk levels by asking three questions: whether the minimum systolic blood pressure over the initial 24 hours is greater than 91, whether the age of the patient is greater than 62.5 years, and whether a condition known as sinus tachycardia is present.<a href="#c05-note-0013" id="R_c05-note-0013"><sup>13</sup></a> The data confirmed this categorization and can be represented in the decision tree structure of <a id="R_c05-fig-0004" href="#c05-fig-0004">Exhibit 5.4</a></p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="125" id="Page_125" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c05-para-0029">What we especially like about this example is how you start with hypotheses, test them with analysis, and then arrive at an inductive logic conclusion. It does a really nice job of helping decide how to quickly segregate high‐ and low‐risk patients suspected of heart attacks. We note that this isn't a new finding and may have been overtaken by newer approaches such as machine learning algorithms that are increasingly important in patient classification.</p>
<p> <i>Example: Rob's bad knee</i></p>
<figure> <img alt="Picture depicting some runners competing in a marathon race." src="images/c05uf002.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="217"/> </figure>
<p id="c05-para-0031">Rob had a successful arthroscopy on his left knee 20 years ago and was able to compete in 10k and half marathon races each year. When he started to get inflammation in his right knee recently, which restricted his training schedule, he unsuccessfully tried icing and rest, and then had a meeting with a sports medicine professional.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0032">Every runner's knees are a focal point and the subject of important decisions following injury. The authoritative <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> (NEJM) noted that over 700,000 APM (arthroscopic partial meniscectomies) knee procedures are carried out in the United States each year.<a href="#c05-note-0014" id="R_c05-note-0014"><sup>14</sup></a> When the diagnosis is meniscus tear, the runner is often presented with a recommendation to have an APM as the next step.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="126" id="Page_126" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>What should Rob do? He had four options:</p>
<ol class="decimal" id="c05-list-0002">
<li id="c05-li-0004">Have an APM surgery performed by a sports medicine professional.</li>
<li id="c05-li-0005">Gather more information on probability of success for APM surgery in his particular case, planning a go/no‐go decision after.</li>
<li id="c05-li-0006">Wait for new technologies in combination with physiotherapy and rehabilitation.</li>
<li id="c05-li-0007">Receive physiotherapy and rehabilitation.</li></ol>
<p id="c05-para-0034">In Rob's case the sports‐medicine professional assessed his condition as being low discomfort, and degenerative with age and years of running. The sports medicine professional proposed a conservative treatment approach, one that didn't involve APM surgery. On the other hand, he learned from the sports medicine specialist of cases of football players with an average age of 22 with knee injuries who were going in for surgery immediately. He had also heard of research suggesting that APMs led to no better outcome than physiotherapy, and that he might be better waiting for stem cell treatments or printable hydrogel menisci, new technologies in development.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0035">How would you make this decision faced with so many disparate pieces of information? As in most problem solving you need to gather some facts. In Rob's case, he read a Finnish study in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> that indicated that when there is low discomfort and age‐degenerative meniscal tear, there is no significant improvement from APM compared to physical therapy. The research method involved a particular kind of randomized control trial termed a sham control, where participants weren't aware of whether they had the procedure or not. The conclusions of the 12‐month follow‐up were that the outcomes for the APM surgery were no better than for the sham APM surgery, notwithstanding that “both groups had significant improvement in primary outcomes.”<a href="#c05-note-0015" id="R_c05-note-0015"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p id="c05-para-0036"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="127" id="Page_127" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Rob also wanted to assess whether he should wait for a new technology solution to develop, such as stem‐cell treatment or a printable hydrogel meniscus. It turns out that clinical trials are getting underway for articular cartilage but not meniscal repair, so a reasonable conclusion can be drawn that any alternative to an arthroscopy is more than five years away.<a href="#c05-note-0016" id="R_c05-note-0016"><sup>16</sup></a> 3D printable hydrogel menisci are now getting a lot of interest but he couldn't estimate when they might be an option.<a href="#c05-note-0017" id="R_c05-note-0017"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p id="c05-para-0037">With the best facts and estimates in hand, things now started to fall into place. Rob decided the best option was to wait and see if a technology solution emerges while continuing to manage activity levels and the resulting inflammation in his right knee. The logic tree in <a id="R_c05-fig-0005" href="#c05-fig-0005">Exhibit 5.5</a> shows both Rob's choices, and those faced by others with more discomfort. Of course they need individual opinions from specialists on the likelihood of APM surgery being successful given their circumstances. Finally, there are a lot of people who have a degenerative condition, who experience low discomfort, are not athletes, and are happy to adopt exercise regimes and physiotherapy as their path forward.</p>

<p id="c05-para-0038">The approach Rob developed is a three‐question rule. In his case the answers led him to a course of action—to wait for new technology while continuing with physiotherapy and rehabilitation (see <a href="#c05-fig-0005">Exhibit 5.5</a>).</p>
<p id="c05-para-0039">In summary, we believe smart analysis starts with heuristics and summary statistics to assess the magnitude and direction of the key problem levers. When we have a good sense of these underlying relationships, we often turn to questions like the examples above. This allows us to further refine our understanding and either make a decision based on available evidence, or to select more detailed answers.</p>
<p id="c05-para-0040"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="128" id="Page_128" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Root cause analysis is a problem solving tool that also uses questions in a clever way. The technique of asking 5 Whys to get to the bottom of a problem was developed at the Toyota Motor Corporation.<a href="#c05-note-0018" id="R_c05-note-0018"><sup>18</sup></a> What is often termed a fishbone diagram is laid out to visualize contributing factors to a problem (see <a id="R_c05-fig-0006" href="#c05-fig-0006">Exhibit 5.6</a>).</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="129" id="Page_129" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="130" id="Page_130" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

<p id="c05-para-0041">The 5 Whys are often used as above in production and operations problems where the technique was developed, and in developing safety cases. But the technique can be useful in other kinds of business problems too. The example in <a id="R_c05-fig-0007" href="#c05-fig-0007">Exhibit 5.7</a> looks at a diagnosis of market‐share loss, looking at superficial causes until the deeper source of the problem is found.</p>

<p>Root cause analysis can also be applied to social problems such as homelessness. A recent <i>Harvard Business Review</i> article on how philanthropy is addressing deep‐seated social problems made the remark that “donors don't want to fund homeless shelters and food pantries. They want to end homelessness and hunger.”<a href="#c05-note-0019" id="R_c05-note-0019"><sup>19</sup></a> To do so means you first need to understand the homelessness problem and its various manifestations. Using the same technique as the example above we need to explore root causes by answering questions like these:</p>
<ul id="c05-list-0003">
<li id="c05-li-0008">Is homelessness an issue mainly for men or women as well?</li>
<li id="c05-li-0009">For women is it younger or older women who are disproportionately represented?</li>
<li id="c05-li-0010">Are homelessness events for younger women episodic or long term in nature? If they are episodic, are they related to domestic violence or financial factors?</li>
<li id="c05-li-0011">Are there adequate women's shelters and support services in a particular community?</li>
<li id="c05-li-0012">Are there programs in communities where domestic violence has been significantly reduced?</li></ul>
<p id="c05-para-0043">The same train of questions applies to other parts of the homelessness logic tree, and most likely will produce different outcomes, including where the problems' origins lie in mental health or drug or alcohol addiction, rather than financial distress or domestic violence. We will revisit homelessness in <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, where we talk about how to tackle wicked problems.</p> </section> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="131" id="Page_131" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="132" id="Page_132" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <section>
