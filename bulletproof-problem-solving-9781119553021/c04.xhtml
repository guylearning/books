<p id="c04-para-0002">Solving some problems is easy. All you need is a piece of paper or a whiteboard, a calculator, and an Internet connection to get data or access expert opinion. The Where‐to‐Live problem we presented in <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> is pretty much like this. You have a family <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="88" id="Page_88" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>meeting to talk about what characteristics in a town are important to each family member, you agree on some rough weightings (Is trail running availability more important than access to fly fishing? What about the commute to work?), you go online to figure out what data is available that correlates reasonably well with those variables, you normalize the data to a 1–100 scale, pop it in a spreadsheet, and see what comes out. It is an important decision, to be sure, but not a very complicated one to think through logically.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0003">But even reasonably straightforward personal‐level projects can get complicated quickly. Look at Rob's Should‐I‐Put‐Solar‐on‐My‐Roof logic tree and analysis. He had to calculate the potential value of the cost savings compared to the utility's rates and the investment required; he had to project whether the feed‐in tariff (what the utility would pay him for excess power) would change and whether solar panels would continue to get cheaper; and he had to estimate his own carbon footprint to calculate whether this investment would substantially decrease his climate impact! As we saw back in <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, none of those analyses is beyond a smart homeowner, but Rob could have wasted a lot of time and effort if he didn't plan these analyses with some thought.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0004">Maybe you think you would like to skip this chapter—it seems boring compared with the logical disaggregation trees of the last chapter, or the exciting use of big data techniques of <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>. Don't do it! Having fun instead of drudgery in problem solving means finding the <i>critical path</i>. The critical path is the continuation of the prioritization process we described toward the end of <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>. It means high‐grading the analysis you use to solve problems so that you are always working on the parts that have the highest probability of yielding insight. Workplanning and the frequent iterations that follow the initial plan are the way you stay on that critical path.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0005">If you are working with a team, or can mimic that with input from family and friends, the workplan is the place to get specific about your initial hypotheses, clarify what outputs you want from analysis, <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="89" id="Page_89" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>and assign the parts so that everyone knows what they are doing and by when. This is also the time to further establish and reinforce good team processes to avoid confirmation bias and other common problem solving mistakes.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0006">This chapter covers best practices in work planning and project management, with examples of how you link your logic tree hypotheses to a plan for analysis. We discuss best practice in one‐day answers, driving from your hypotheses. Finally, we introduce more team processes and norms to aid creativity and fight biases and cognitive errors in problem solving.</p> </section> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-24"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Workplanning and Project Management</span></h2>
<p id="c04-para-0007">Lots of people have experience with workplanning and project management. Let's face it, a lot of those experiences are probably bad. Workplans are typically endless in length and full of quickly outmoded detail. Responsibilities and timing expectations are vague and often violated, and unpleasant surprises in team follow‐up meetings are all too common (“I thought you were going to interview John Snow” or “That isn't what I expected it to look like!”).</p>
<p id="c04-para-0008">For these reasons, we learned at McKinsey to do our workplanning with some twists (see <a href="#c04-fig-0001" id="R_c04-fig-0001">Exhibit 4.1</a>).</p>
<figure><img alt="Tabular chart displaying a model of work planning with a list of some twists of what and why we analyse a problem." src="images/c04ex001.jpg" class="center" width="651" height="487"/>
<figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c04-fig-0001" id="c04-fig-0001" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 4.1</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c04-para-0009">These best‐practice approaches to workplanning mean that we don't do any analysis for which we don't have a hypothesis. We never go off and build a model without a very good idea about what question it answers. We sharpen our thinking even more by requiring that we can visualize what form the output might take (we call this <i>dummying</i> the chart), so we know if we would want it if we had it. We order our analyses logically, so those that can knock out, or obviate later analyses, are done first. And we are painfully explicit about who is expected to do what analysis by what date and time. By being specific here, we save tons of time in wasted work.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0010"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="90" id="Page_90" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Done well, it looks like <a href="#c04-fig-0002" id="R_c04-fig-0002">Exhibit 4.2</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="Chart displaying a model workplan summarizing the specificity at each level, issue, hypothesis, analysis, source of data, responsibility, and end products." src="images/c04ex002.jpg" class="center" width="800" height="709"/>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c04-para-0011">We introduced the Bay Area Nursing example in <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>. Let's take a look at an example workplan from that bit of problem solving. You can see in <a href="#c04-fig-0003" id="R_c04-fig-0003">Exhibit 4.3</a> the specificity at each level, issue, hypothesis, analysis, source of data, responsibility, and end products.</p>
<figure><img alt="Tabular chart of a detailed workplan of the Bay area nursing discussing the specificity at each level, issue, hypothesis, analysis, source of data, responsibility, and end products." src="images/c04ex003.jpg" class="center" width="798" height="592"/>
<figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a id="c04-fig-0003" href="#R_c04-fig-0003" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 4.3</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c04-para-0012">There is a human inclination to just jump in to analysis without being crystal clear about what output is needed to solve the problem. Team members seem more prepared to spend time building models and conducting complex analyses than they are in carefully specifying what they <i>really want</i> from this work. With even more powerful analytic tools now available, including the learning algorithms of artificial intelligence techniques we'll talk about in <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, the urge to wade prematurely into data without doing the thinking on the underlying structure of the problem is even stronger than in the past. You should avoid this tendency. We encourage you to think <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="91" id="Page_91" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>hard about problem structure and desired outputs before you start running numbers.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0013">As we discuss earlier, the order in which we do our analyses matters. If you set up your workplan carefully, you'll do the knock‐out analyses first, the really important analyses next, and the nice to have analyses last. In Rob's solar case, the <i>years to payback</i> for his investment under a likely case power‐pricing scenario was the knock‐out analysis. If the payback was too long or uncertain, it just didn't make sense to continue to the other analyses. Rob's question <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="92" id="Page_92" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>of next importance was whether it <i>made sense to wait</i>, due in this case to declining solar PV panel costs. In investment decisions, timing is often critical even when the overall case for investment is strong. Rob and Paula are committed conservationists, but estimating the <i>reduction in carbon footprint</i>, the third question, is really a nice‐to‐have in this case. On pure investment grounds this investment has a 25% return, better than any interest rate out there. If the investment case was weaker, the carbon reduction might have pushed Rob to install the panels in any case, so it was important to include it in the tree—and it provides some emotional downside protection if some of the cost savings don't materialize.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0014">Knock‐out analysis involves making estimates of the importance of a variable and the influence you can have on it, an estimate of expected value, the first cut of which comes out of our prioritization <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="93" id="Page_93" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>matrix from <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>. As a result of a rough knock‐out analysis, you typically conclude that some lines of enquiry aren't worth pursuing. For example, in reviewing business units in one of Rob's client's cost reduction exercise, a knock‐out analysis concluded that a 50% gain from outsourcing was possible, which sounds great. But the contribution to that group to the overall company's cost reduction target was only 5%. As a consequence no effort was focused on that particular unit, with the attention placed on units that would make a larger contribution to the target. This is consistent with the 80/20 rule we will discuss in the next chapter: Focus your work on the 20% of the problem that yields 80% of the benefit.</p> <section>

<h3 id="head-3-8"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Chunky Workplans and Lean Project Plans</span></h3>
<p id="c04-para-0015">Tools like Microsoft Project can be extremely helpful in workplanning. But they can also end up being like a beast that needs to be fed, generating enormous detail in workplanning that stretches out in time. As a new McKinsey engagement manager, before he developed the seven steps discipline, Charles was famous for working all night to generate 30 page workplans for his teams. But with this much detail, they were at risk of being swallowed up by all the analyses that <i>could be done</i>, without any sense of critical path. These encyclopedic workplans were quickly outmoded when the first few analyses pointed to promising new avenues in the work. The way we do problem solving now—driving from hypotheses, using rough and ready analysis approaches wherever possible, frequent porpoising into the data, and constant iterations to refine the problem statement and logic tree understanding—we find that long workplans are unnecessary and unhelpful.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0016">Our approach is to do short, but highly specific, workplans that focus on the most important initial analyses, perhaps stretching out two to three weeks, and constantly revise them as new insights come from the team's work. We couple these with rougher project plans, usually in Gantt chart format, that cover the fixed milestone dates and to ensure the overall project stays on track from a time perspective. We call them chunky workplans and lean project plans (see <a href="#c04-fig-0004" id="R_c04-fig-0004">Exhibit 4.4</a>).</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="94" id="Page_94" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="95" id="Page_95" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

<span id="c04-sec-0004"></span>
<h2 id="head-2-25"><span style="color: #d9272e;">One‐Day Answers</span></h2>
<p id="c04-para-0017">We find there is great clarity in stating what you know about your problem at any point in the process. It helps bed down what understandings are emerging, and what unknowns still stand between the answers and us. We call this a one‐day answer, and they convey our current best analysis of the situation, complications or insightful observations, and our best guess at the solution, as we iterate between our evolving workplans and our analysis. By working this way we can divert resources to areas where we have the biggest gaps in problem solving and shut down analysis that is not taking us anywhere. We contrast this approach with typical efforts that encourage gathering huge data sets and endless interviews before problem solving starts. As analysis results come in, we can refine our one‐day answers and begin to synthesize our evidence into more complete stories. We'll talk below about how we use other team processes to avoid the potential for confirmation bias that comes from early hypothesizing.</p>
<p>There are many ways to structure one‐day answers, but the classic way employed in McKinsey and elsewhere is to organize them in three parts:</p>
<ol class="decimal" id="c04-list-0001">
<li id="c04-li-0001">A short description of the situation that prevails at the outset of problem solving. This is the state of affairs that sets up the problem.</li>
<li id="c04-li-0002">A set of observations or complications around the situation that creates the tension or dynamic that captures the problem. This is typically what changed, or what went wrong that created the problem.</li>
<li id="c04-li-0003">The best idea of the implication or resolution of the problem that you have right now. At the beginning this will be rough and speculative. Later it will be a more and more refined idea that answers the question, “What should we do?”</li></ol>
<p id="c04-para-0019">We usually use this order of situation–observation–resolution in our team processes, but later on as you begin to synthesize your <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="96" id="Page_96" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>findings, you may reverse these and lead with “You should do this,” then followed by supporting reasons. <a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a> explains this in more detail.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0020">One‐day answers should be crisp and concise. This is not the place to have 40 bullet points of unorganized facts. <a href="#c04-fig-0005" id="R_c04-fig-0005">Exhibit 4.5</a> gives some best‐practice thoughts.</p>
<figure><img alt="Tabular chart summarizing one-day answers that are crisp and concise and gives some best-practice thoughts." src="images/c04ex005.jpg" class="center" width="800" height="510"/>
<figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c04-fig-0005" id="c04-fig-0005" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 4.5</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's look at a short example from our hardware company case study.</p>
<ul class="none" id="c04-list-0002">
<li id="c04-li-0004"><b>Situation:</b> Hechinger is a dominant player with a long and successful history in one region and seeks to expand.</li>
<li id="c04-li-0005"><b>Complication:</b> A new competitor, Home Depot, has emerged with a warehouse superstore model that appears to be growing much faster, driven by substantially lower pricing. Their business model is different, and compensates for lower prices by sourcing <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="97" id="Page_97" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>economies, lower cost logistics, and higher asset productivity. They will soon have geographic overlap with Hechinger.</li>
<li id="c04-li-0006"><b>Resolution:</b> To remain competitive, Hechinger needs to quickly reform its inventory management and logistics systems, and develop lower‐cost sourcing models, to allow lower pricing—or it will face a real threat even in its core markets.</li></ul>
<p id="c04-para-0022">As you can see, this is a concise summary of where the problem solving effort sits at a moment in time. It guides the analysis that still has to be done (in this case particularly the answer to the question “What should Hechinger do?”). It provides a strawman that can (and should) be attacked and stress tested for faulty thinking. And it gives you something to say if you find yourself in an elevator‐test moment!</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c04-sec-0005"></span>
<h2 id="head-2-26"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Great Team Processes for Workplanning and Analysis</span></h2>
<p id="c04-para-0023">Nearly everyone has experience working in teams, and we're willing to bet you have worked on good ones and bad ones. Our task is focused on problem solving, not good management practices more broadly, but there is lots of overlap. We have found that the best teams have relatively flat structures, good processes and norms, and explicit approaches to avoiding bias. Let's take each of these in turn.</p> <section>
<span id="c04-sec-0006"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-9"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Team Structure and Leadership</span></h3>
<p id="c04-para-0024">Good problem solving teams usually have an excellent lead or coordinator—somewhere between a musical conductor and an air traffic controller—who makes sure that the basic elements come together and on time. But the best teams typically have relatively little hierarchy in the structure of brainstorming and ideation. This kind of structure can be challenging to create inside larger organizations that have conventional hierarchical roles. When we work within large organizations, we nearly always set up temporary teams <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="98" id="Page_98" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>that act outside the normal reporting structures and deliberately have limited lives. This allows for non‐hierarchical and creative team processes that are more likely to generate good solutions.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0025">Of course, these same principles apply to working on family‐level problems, and to social‐scale problems with decision makers inside political hierarchies. In every case we try to make conventional authority figures play a different and less directive role in problem solving to get fresh and creative answers.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0026">We will deal with some important insights on team composition next.</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c04-sec-0007"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-10"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Team Norms</span></h3>
<p>Over the course of our careers, we have seen some teams that problem solve in a highly efficient way and others that flail around, miss deadlines, and fail to develop compelling solutions. This can happen even after good work on problem definition, disaggregation, and prioritization. What is it that good problem solving teams do better in their approach to workplanning and analysis? A number of things stand out in our experience:</p>
<ol class="decimal" id="c04-list-0003">
<li id="c04-li-0007"><i>They are hypothesis driven and end‐product oriented</i>. They use strong hypotheses to guide workplanning and analyses. This doesn't mean they are trying to prove the hypothesis in spite of the facts. Just the opposite: Strong hypotheses are easier to challenge and pressure test. The end products we are describing are typically analyses that will unambiguously resolve an issue or sub‐issue. For Rob's knee arthroscopy, discussed in the next chapter, he framed the hypothesis that he should have surgery now and then set out the supporting analyses. He set a clear threshold for those: that the outcome would be better than doing nothing and that no improved technology solution was imminent. The end product of his analysis was the completed decision tree where he compiled research studies and the latest timing of new treatments such as stem cells for meniscal repair.</li>
<li id="c04-li-0008"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="99" id="Page_99" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i>They porpoise frequently between the hypothesis and data</i>. They are flexible in the face of new data. This means they are ready to cease analysis where it has reached a dead end and start work on promising new lines of inquiry. In the Avahan HIV project in India that we introduced in <a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, the team started with an initial hypothesis that was directionally useful but provided no leverage for action. What did they do? They took a new tack based on what they had learned that focused on female sex workers and the communities in which they lived. This hadn't previously been explored as part of a disease problem, and it ultimately yielded insight and a course of action of profound impact.</li>
<li id="c04-li-0009"><i>They look for breakthrough thinking rather than incremental improvements</i>. They do this by asking about performance limits and reference points for best practice, and the distance they are from those limits. A mining company using large, heavy vehicles was exploring whether they could do tire changes more quickly. They asked who did tire changes fastest and had the most experience in the world. The answer was Formula 1. The mining team then visited Formula 1 racing pits to learn about how they could improve their processes. That is creativity!</li></ol> </section> <section>
<span id="c04-sec-0008"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-11"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Team Behaviors to Avoid Bias and Error</span></h3>
<p id="c04-para-0028">Many of you will be familiar with the notion of type 1 and type 2 thinking patterns, introduced to the general public in Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman's <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>.<a href="#c04-note-0001" id="R_c04-note-0001"><sup>1</sup></a> Type 1 thinking is automatic and intuitive, and governs much of our behavior. Perhaps to save us from being eaten by jackals, many of our decisions are essentially automatic, without the conscious logic of type 2 considered, rational thinking. Any time we have done something before and had it be successful, it is more likely that our brains will quickly choose this path again, without conscious thought. Just like learning to say a foreign phrase, the first time is labored and <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="100" id="Page_100" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>painfully self‐conscious. With time it becomes, literally, second nature and disappears into our automatic mental systems.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0029">This is great for speaking a new language or riding a bike or tying your shoes … but not so great for systematic problem solving. Our kind of problem solving can and does benefit from pattern recognition, of course. When you correctly see that a particular business problem is best cleaved by a return on capital tree or a supply curve, it makes problem solving faster and more accurate. Philip Tetlock reports that grandmasters at chess have 50,000–100,000 patterns stored in this deep memory system.<a href="#c04-note-0002" id="R_c04-note-0002"><sup>2</sup></a> But when we incorrectly see a familiar framing for a <i>new</i> kind of problem, we risk disastrously wrong solutions or endless work getting back on track. This kind of mistake is sometimes called an availability heuristic (you use the framework you happen to have handy, not the right one) or substitution bias (you substitute a simple model you know rather than understanding the more complicated actual model). And even when there is no absolute cognitive mistake in problem framing, excessive problem patterning is a block on novel solutions and creativity in problem solving.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0030">Now here is the bad news. Depending on who is counting,<a href="#c04-note-0003" id="R_c04-note-0003"><sup>3</sup></a> there are upwards of one hundred different kinds of cognitive biases and mistakes that humans are prone to make in problem solving, some related to type 1 <i>fast</i> thinking errors, some driven by other processing biases, including many related to our relationship with resources. The enumeration of cognitive biases in decision making coming out of experimental psychology and behavioral economics is both interesting and important for anyone who cares about problem solving. But to believe some of the literature, these biases render people incapable of rational thought entirely! In our experience good problem solving design and team processes can address most of these, and in addition encourage creativity. This is what the seven steps process is all about.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="101" id="Page_101" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <section>
<span id="c04-sec-0009"></span>
<h4 id="head-4-1"><span style="color: #d9272e;"><i>A Practical Way to Deal with Biases</i></span></h4>
<p>Lets talk about the main sources of bias and error in problem solving. In conversations with our former colleague and Kahneman collaborator, Professor Dan Lovallo, he suggests that the most important to address are confirmation bias, anchoring bias, and loss aversion.<a href="#c04-note-0004" id="R_c04-note-0004"><sup>4</sup></a> We will add in availability bias and overoptimism as additional issues to address in your team processes. Indeed, as <a href="#c04-fig-0006" id="R_c04-fig-0006">Exhibit 4.6</a> shows, many of the other biases described in the literature are forms of these five underlying issues.</p>
<figure><img alt="Tabular chart summarizing  a great workplan and team processes on how to deal with biases." src="images/c04ex006.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="874"/>

</figcaption></figure>
<ol class="decimal" id="c04-list-0004">
<li id="c04-li-0010"><i>Confirmation bias</i> is falling in love with your one‐day answer. It is the failure to seriously consider the antithesis to your thesis, ignoring dissenting views—essentially picking low hanging mental fruit.</li>
<li id="c04-li-0011"><i>Anchoring bias</i> is the mistaken mental attachment to an initial data range or data pattern that colors your subsequent understanding of the problem.</li>
<li id="c04-li-0012"><i>Loss aversion</i>, and its relatives, the sunk cost fallacy, book loss fear, and the endowment effect, are a failure to ignore costs already spent (sunk) or any asymmetric valuing of losses and gains.</li>
<li id="c04-li-0013"><i>Availability bias</i> is use of an existing mental map because it is readily at hand, rather than developing a new model for a new problem, or just being influenced by more recent facts or events.</li>
<li id="c04-li-0014"><i>Overoptimism</i> comes in several forms including overconfidence, illusion of control or simply failure to contemplate disaster outcomes.</li></ol>
<p id="c04-para-0032">There are a number of team process‐design approaches that can lessen the impact of most of these cognitive biases and errors, and that can simultaneously encourage more novelty and creativity in problem solving.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0033"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="102" id="Page_102" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <i>Diversity in team members:</i> Building a team with different backgrounds and viewpoints really helps create an environment of active openness to new ideas and approaches. This is a great source of creativity in problem solving and often overlooked. If you are solving your problem solo, find a way to brainstorm your ideas with a diverse range of others, insiders and outsiders, at each <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="103" id="Page_103" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>stage of the process. Phillip Tetlock's work on forecasting shows that teams always outperform individuals in this form of problem solving, even very high‐performing solo practitioners. And the best superforecasting teams even beat crowd‐sourcing and prediction markets.<a href="#c04-note-0005" id="R_c04-note-0005"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p id="c04-para-0034"><i>Always try multiple trees/cleaves:</i> Even when a problem seems perfectly designed for your favorite framework, try multiple cleaving frames to see what different questions and insights emerge. When we decided to look at obesity as a wicked problem, discussed in <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, we had a team meeting where we tried out various alternative‐cleaving frames. In only half an hour we outlined a number of possible cleaving frames and argued the case for each—such as incent/regulate, individual behavior/public health, incidence/severity and supply/demand, before settling on supply/demand. Don't settle on your first cut through the problem.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0035"><i>Try adding question marks to your hypotheses</i>. We are committed to being hypothesis driven, but our former colleague Caroline Webb's work reports behavioral research suggesting that active questioning moves our brains into discovery mode, away from confirmation mode.<a href="#c04-note-0006" id="R_c04-note-0006"><sup>6</sup></a> A number of the best problem solvers we've met use active questioning as their prime problem solving tool. The answers they get lead to the next set of questions until finally the hypothesis is sharpened or challenged in its present form.</p>
<p> <i>Team Brainstorming Practices:</i> The values your team establishes early on contribute enormously to the quality of your problem solving. Here are some practices we have found especially conducive to fighting biases and promoting creativity:</p>
<ul id="c04-list-0005">
<li id="c04-li-0015">Obligation to dissent<p id="c04-para-0038" class="listPara1">A core value of McKinsey is the <i>obligation to dissent</i> and it is baked into even the greenest business analysts from induction. This means not only is it okay for a junior team member to speak <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="104" id="Page_104" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>up when they disagree in a brainstorming session—or in front of the client—it is an absolute obligation. Senior team members who don't adhere to this value can be fired. Team members typically respect hierarchy and need team leaders to encourage them to speak up if they have a different view, whether they have been employed for a day or ten years.</p>
</li>
<li id="c04-li-0016">Role playing<p id="c04-para-0040" class="listPara1">Try acting out your interim solutions from the perspective of clients, suppliers, other family members, citizens … whoever isn't you. Then switch roles and play a new character. It sounds embarrassing—and it is at first—but it is remarkably clarifying. Caroline Webb also recommends drawing, mapping, or verbalizing solutions as alternatives to conventional discourse to generate different and more creative results.<a href="#c04-note-0007" id="R_c04-note-0007"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li id="c04-li-0017">Dialectic standard<p id="c04-para-0042" class="listPara1">Establish the classical argument form as your team norm: thesis, antithesis, synthesis. This means every idea or hypothesis must be met with its antithesis and challenged, before joining the learning together in synthesis.</p>
</li>
<li id="c04-li-0018">Perspective taking<p id="c04-para-0044" class="listPara1">Perspective taking is the act of modeling another team member's assertion or belief (especially if you don't agree) to the point that you can describe it as compellingly as the other.<a href="#c04-note-0008" id="R_c04-note-0008"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</li>
<li id="c04-li-0019">Constructive confrontation<p id="c04-para-0046" class="listPara1">To disagree without being disagreeable is the heart of great problem solving team process. One of the great tools we both used in McKinsey is “What would you have to believe?” to accept a particular thesis or viewpoint. This involves spelling out all of the assumptions implicit in the perspective, and all the implications. One example of “What would you have to believe?” involved looking at a growth company's share price during the dot‐com era. To justify the share price earnings had to grow at 40% compound for the next five years, then at double the US GDP growth <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="105" id="Page_105" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>rate in perpetuity! That is an unbelievably high growth expectation … and was not achieved, leading to a stock price crash for the company.</p>
</li>
<li id="c04-li-0020">Team distributed voting<p id="c04-para-0048" class="listPara1">There is often disagreement when pruning branches on a logic tree, or when assigning priorities in the analysis work planning. If you aren't careful, the most articulate or senior team member can inappropriately sway the conversation. As described in <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, one approach we have used is to assign each team member 10 votes, represented by sticky notes, and have each team member use them to vote on their favorite (or least favorite) analysis, allowing cumulative or bullet voting—most senior person votes last, so as not to bias the choices of more junior members.</p>
</li>
<li id="c04-li-0021">Solicit outside views (but be careful with experts)<p id="c04-para-0050" class="listPara1">It is easy to breathe your own exhaust in intensive problem solving, especially when you are working in a space or business that is familiar. It is critical to engage outside data and perspectives to refresh your view of the problem. The normal thing is to interview experts—but the risk is that they just reinforce the dominant or mainstream view and therefore smother creativity. Try talking to customers, suppliers, or better yet players in a different but related industry or space.</p>
</li></ul>
<p id="c04-para-0051"><i>Explicit Downside Scenario Modeling and Pre‐Mortem Analysis:</i> Nicolas Taleb's wonderful book <i>The Black Swan</i><a href="#c04-note-0009" id="R_c04-note-0009"><sup>9</sup></a> reminds us of the dangers of assuming normal distributions. Improbable jumps or discontinuous events do occur, and long‐tailed distributions (irregular‐shaped statistical distributions with a long tail on one side, indicating small but measurable probability for even extreme events) mean we should take these into account in our problem solving and modeling. This means that we should explicitly model not just a narrow band (expected case, downside case) of values, but more extreme downside cases. A related idea is to do pre‐mortem <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="106" id="Page_106" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>analysis, where the team works through all the implications of even unlikely failure cases.<a href="#c04-note-0010" id="R_c04-note-0010"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p id="c04-para-0052"><i>Good analytic techniques:</i> Humans are prone to a number of errors around money. These include paying attention to sunk costs, unreasonably high discount rates on future events, and treating losses and gains asymmetrically. One way to avoid these errors is to use good analytic techniques, including problem/model design, net present value analysis, marginal analysis, and use of cash flows rather than accounting book values. We will cover these in <a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0053"><i>Broaden your data sources:</i> In every area of life, individual/workplace/society, there are core government and private data sets that everyone has access to. Sometimes these are terrific, but everyone has them, including your competitors, and there are often methodological issues in their collection. It is worth considering whether there are options for crowd sourcing alternative data, whether prediction markets cover your topic or could be induced to, or whether your interest area is amenable to some form of A|B testing or randomized controlled trials. Custom data collection costs have come down substantially and new data sets can yield insights very different from the obvious mainstream analyses. Tools such as Survey Monkey are simple to use and can bring customer, competitor, and supplier perspectives that may be especially insightful.</p>
<p id="c04-para-0054">How does this all get put in place in real‐life settings in your teams? Often by the cues and behaviors of the team leader, like the case in <a href="#c04-fig-0007" id="R_c04-fig-0007">Exhibit 4.7</a>.</p>

<h4 id="head-4-2"><span style="color: #d9272e;"><i>Agile Team Processes</i></span></h4>
<p id="c04-para-0055">In the Introduction we argued that many organizations are responding to demands to be become better problem solvers by taking on the persona of problem solving corporations. They do so by seeking to become lean and agile and often employ the language <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="107" id="Page_107" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>of scrums, a term from rugby. They seek to work on the right problems, address root causes of problems, and organize around teams with short duration work plans and clear accountability (see <a href="#c04-fig-0008" id="R_c04-fig-0008">Exhibit 4.8</a>). All this is consistent with the approach we have outlined in this chapter.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="108" id="Page_108" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="109" id="Page_109" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c04-para-0056">Above all, there is an orientation or attitude that is found in the best problem solvers that reflects an <i>active openness</i> to new ideas and data, and a suspicion of standard or conventional answers (see <a href="#c04-fig-0009" id="R_c04-fig-0009">Exhibit 4.9</a>). Tetlock describes it well in profiling the superforecasters.</p>

<p id="c04-para-0057">In closing, good workplans make an enormous difference in problem solving. We have explained how they are a necessary but not sufficient condition for problem solving success. One‐day answers help sharpen our hypotheses and make our analysis focused and efficient. Knock‐out analyses provide focus on the critical path in problem solving. Finally, there are a host of team effectiveness disciplines that accompany the workplan that can help you produce great outcomes and guard against the pitfalls and biases that we hear so much about.</p> </section> </section> </section> <section>
