<h2 id="head-2-16"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p id="c03-para-0002">Good problem disaggregation is at the heart of the seven steps process. Any problem of real consequence is too complicated to solve without breaking it down into logical parts that help us understand the <i>drivers or causes</i> of the situation. So this is the most important step in problem solving: taking the problem apart in a way that helps us see the potential pathways to solve it. At the same time, when we can see all the parts clearly, we can determine what <i>not</i> to work on, the bits that are either too difficult to change, or that don't impact the problem much. When you get good at cleaving problems apart, insights come quickly. The magic comes in seeing which type of logic tree makes an elegant solution more obvious. It is like a plan to cut a diamond—doing it the right way really matters.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0003">The diamond‐cutting analogy is fun. But there is a risk in it. It makes the problem of cleaving seem too difficult, like it is a task for experts only. In truth, any of us can get started with an online literature review of the facets of the problem to generate ideas. This brainstorming on the shape and elements of the problem leads to an elemental logic tree to begin to cleave the problem open.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0004">In this chapter we will cover the use of logic trees to disaggregate problems, keep track of the parts for analysis, and build insights toward solutions. We will introduce several kinds of logic trees that are appropriate for earlier or later stages of problem solving, or for different kinds of problems, including factor/lever trees, deductive logic trees, hypothesis trees, and decision trees. Some problems give up their answers in straightforward and intuitive ways. Others require more patience to yield insight. This chapter will cover the use of cleaving frameworks or heuristics for individual, organization, and social level problems that may help crack tougher problems more quickly and elegantly. We will then talk about prioritization of problem elements to prune off branches of the tree that don't contribute enough to the answer to spend time on. And finally we'll talk about team and solo processes that make disaggregation and prioritization easier and less prone to decision‐making biases.</p> </section> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="51" id="Page_51" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-17"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Types of Logic Trees: Getting Started</span></h2>
<p id="c03-para-0005">Logic trees are really just structures for seeing the elements of a problem in a clear way, and keeping track of different <i>levels</i> of the problem, which we liken to trunks, branches, twigs, and leaves. You can arrange them from left to right, right to left, or top to bottom—whatever makes the elements easier for you to visualize. There are lots of ways to do it; in fact, we almost always try two or three alternative disaggregations to discover which yields the most insights. Think of a logic tree as a mental model of your problem. Better trees have a clearer and more complete logic of relationships linking the parts to each other, are more comprehensive, and have no overlaps—but we'll get to all that.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0006">Here is a simple example of tree construction: The task of planning to build a brick wall can be seen as either a <i>process</i> or as the sum of its <i>components</i>—both yield different insights and are helpful for visualizing the task of building the wall (see <a href="#c03-fig-0001" id="R_c03-fig-0001">Exhibit 3.1</a>).</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="52" id="Page_52" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting the process flow and various components involved in building a brick wall." src="images/c03ex001.jpg" class="center" width="599" height="513"/>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c03-para-0007"><a href="#c03-fig-0002" id="R_c03-fig-0002">Exhibit 3.2</a> shows a number of different tree structures we have found useful in practice, and a sense of when they are best employed. Early on in the process we usually employ component or factor trees, and often work inductively (learning from specific cases that illuminate general principles later), to help us define basic problem structure. Later, after some iterations with data and analysis, we usually move to hypothesis trees, deductive logic <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="53" id="Page_53" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>trees, or decision trees, depending on the nature of the problem. The only rule here is to move when you can from trees with general problem elements to trees that state clear hypotheses to test; vague labels do not drive analysis or action—which is the whole point.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting the different types of logic trees and when each one should be put to useful practice." src="images/c03ex002.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="788"/>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c03-para-0008">At the very beginning, when you are able to state your problem clearly but don't yet have a detailed understanding of the problem to provide a vantage point on the solution, it usually makes sense to employ the simplest kind of tree, a component or factor tree. The goal in building logic trees is to find the levers that help us crack our problem, starting with the components that can help focus data gathering and eventually move us toward good hypotheses that can be tested. Components or factors are just the most obvious elements that make up a problem, like the bricks and mortar of our earlier brick wall example. You can usually find enough information for a logical first disaggregation with a small amount of Internet research and a team brainstorming session. Let's look at a case study to make this clearer.</p> <section>
<span id="c03-sec-0004"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-1"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Case Study: Saving Pacific Salmon—From Initial Component Tree to Refined Hypothesis Tree</span></h3>
<p id="c03-para-0009"><a href="#c03-fig-0003" id="R_c03-fig-0003">Exhibit 3.3</a> shows an example of this kind of component or lever tree from Charles's work in salmon conservation, first introduced in <a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>. This tree was developed very early in the process, when the foundation he worked for knew it was committed to working on the problem, but didn't have a grasp of all the elements and relationships that defined the problem space.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration of an example of the lever tree depicting salmon abundance and diversity, for saving Pacific salmon." src="images/c03ex003.jpg" class="center" width="667" height="788"/>
 <figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c03-fig-0003" id="c03-fig-0003" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 3.3</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c03-para-0010">So the team developed a rudimentary component tree to begin to get a handle on the problem. To get to this stage we read everything we could find about salmon and talked to a number of experts in salmon conservation. That involved days of work, not weeks—our experience is that you should only do enough initial research to generate a first‐cut tree, since the tree structure will act as a guide to make further research more efficient.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0011"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="54" id="Page_54" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>As you can see, this first‐cut tree is busy. It helps us see the big levers that affect salmon, but it doesn't have much insight coming through yet, since it is still at the component level, without clear hypotheses. We knew freshwater watershed quality and ocean environmental conditions would be important to Pacific salmon abundance and diversity, as would be the impact of commercial and other fisheries, <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="55" id="Page_55" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>hatcheries and fish farms, consumer behavior, and government policy. We could see some of the secondary and tertiary layers of the problem, but we didn't have a strong sense of importance or magnitude of any lever, or which ones our grant funding could affect. So we weren't in a position to develop hypotheses to guide our data gathering, analysis, and prioritization. But we did have a good list of factors affecting salmon, and we did have several layers of interventions mapped out. This gave the team better direction for the next stage of research and relationship building in salmon country. It was a good start, but only a start.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0012">This first stage component tree for Pacific salmon is deficient in a number of other ways as well. It doesn't address the substantial regional differences in which factors are important. It doesn't show any sense of the magnitude impact of each lever. And it creates a significant confusion in the government policy element, which is shown as a separate topic area, rather than as it truly plays out by affecting <i>each</i> lever from watershed protections to fisheries to artificial propagation.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0013">It is worth stopping here for a moment to introduce an important principle in logic tree construction, the concept of <i>MECE</i>. MECE stands for “mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive.” Because this tree confuses or overlaps some of its branches, it isn't MECE. It's a mouthful, but it is a really useful concept.</p>
<p>Trees should have branches that are:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left"><b>Mutually Exclusive <i>and</i></b></td>
<td class="left">The branches of the tree don't overlap, or contain partial elements of the same factor or component. This is a little hard to get your head around, but it means that the core concept of each trunk or branch of the problem is self‐contained, not spread across several branches.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><b>Collectively Exhaustive</b></td>
<td class="left">Taken as a whole, your tree contains <i>all</i> of the elements of the problem, not just some of them. If you are missing parts, you may very well miss the solution to your problem.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p id="c03-para-0015"><a href="#c03-fig-0004" id="R_c03-fig-0004">Exhibit 3.4</a> provides a way of seeing it visually.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="56" id="Page_56" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

<p id="c03-para-0016">To give an example related to our Truckgear competition case from <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, if you are evaluating retailer performance with a return on capital tree, you put existing store sales on a different branch than new store sales to be mutually exclusive; to be collectively exhaustive you make sure your tree includes all sources of sales, including existing stores, new stores, and online sales. If you are having trouble getting clear hypotheses out of your tree, check to see if it is really MECE.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0017">Constant iteration is key to making the seven steps work. After Charles's team had done a literature review, they met with many experts, forging relationships on the ground with conservation organizations, government agencies, policy personnel, fishers, and First Nations leadership. They commissioned exploratory science work with salmon researchers, and were able to refine their salmon <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="57" id="Page_57" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>tree and transition from a simple, components visualization to a hypothesis tree. As you can see from <a href="#c03-fig-0005" id="R_c03-fig-0005">Exhibit 3.5</a>, this tree is better organized and MECE, with more active questions. And it has focused the team's analysis on both specific regions and intervention types. These were not very specific hypotheses at this <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="58" id="Page_58" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>stage, but they allowed the team to work with its new partners to develop a set of initial grants to push some early outcomes (which included a ban on expansion of salmon farming further north in British Columbia) and promoted greater Foundation understanding in what became a 15‐year, $275m effort to help preserve Pacific salmon. At a later stage, which will be discussed in this chapter, the team was able to prune off some lower impact or higher difficulty branches of the tree, which helped focus its problem solving on high‐potential outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="head-3-2"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Deductive Logic Trees</span></h3>
<p>Deductive logic trees take their name from the process of logical deduction. Deductive reasoning is sometimes called top–down reasoning, because when we apply it we argue from <i>general</i> rules or principles to conclusions via more specific data and assertions. A classic kind of deductive statement is structured like this:</p>
<ul id="c03-list-0001">
<li id="c03-li-0001">General statement: All watchmakers need glasses.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0002">Specific observation: Sally is a watchmaker.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0003">Deductive conclusion: Sally needs glasses.</li></ul>
<p id="c03-para-0019">Deductive logic trees are constructed similarly, with a problem statement that may sometimes be expressed in quantities, and branches that are typically logically or mathematically complete, so that the components add up to the desired objective of the problem statement. We use this kind of tree when we know a lot about the logical structure of a problem, and especially when the cleaving frame is inherently mathematical, as we saw with the return on profit levers tree in <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>. A more sophisticated version of this includes the investment costs of different actions, not just the impact on profitability.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0020">Why analyze return on invested capital? Return on invested capital (ROIC) signals how well a company can turn investments into profit. Arithmetically it is the product of two components: profit margin (sometimes called return on sales) and capital turnover (the ratio of sales to invested capital). ROIC is useful for comparing firms by <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="59" id="Page_59" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>understanding the levers affecting the return on company assets, irrespective of ownership structure (debt and equity) and excess cash. If you are interested in business problems, learn this tree. The next case study focuses on the use of a return on capital tree to understand the competition between two businesses. You can also find a more generic example in <a href="#c03-fig-0009">Exhibit 3.9</a>.</p> </section> <section>

<h3 id="head-3-3"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Case Study: Battle of the Hardware Kings: Hechinger versus Home Depot</span></h3>
<p id="c03-para-0021">As industries change, business models are tested through tough competition and market disruption. Through the use of a ROIC tree, Charles was able to determine which levers were driving the profitability and growth of two competitors in the hardware industry. Charles worked for a consulting company that was hired by Hechinger Hardware to develop an expansion plan into new markets. The problem definition step revealed that in order to successfully expand, the business had to be able to withstand the competition of its rising peers. This tree helped the team he was on discover that an epic battle was brewing. Here is the story.</p>
<p>Hechinger Hardware opened its first hardware store in 1919, focusing its marketing strategy on the retail consumer, rather than contractors, fueling the growth of the do‐it‐yourself hardware business. While it had begun slowly expanding across its first half century, the family‐owned company planned for more rapid expansion after going public in 1972. At that time the hardware industry was growing at nearly 12% annually, more than two times the US economy, and rising home prices increased homeowners' attention to upkeep and continuous improvement of their homes.</p>
<blockquote style="color: #d9272e;">
<p id="c03-para-0023">The Company [Hechinger] has an enviable track record, including 39 consecutive quarters of positive earnings per share comparisons …</p>
<p class="right"><i>Alex Brown and Sons Analyst Report, FY1984</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="c03-para-0025">With strong performance and promising industry predictions, Hechinger was looking to expand into new markets. It had <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="60" id="Page_60" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>$130 million of cash available for expansion on its books and strong employee seniority—150 managers across the chain had nine years or more of experience—so company management felt confident in their ability to build market share.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0026">However, the consulting team's analysis uncovered a problem for Hechinger that it didn't see coming. A small southern competitor, Home Depot, had opened three new warehouse‐style stores starting in 1979, a novel idea. In contrast to Hechinger's spotless stores, extensive backrooms for inventory storage, and relatively high prices, Home Depot built a warehouse hardware superstore model intended for both retail shoppers and contractors. Going public in 1981 they began to rapidly expand from their Atlanta base, coincident with Hechinger's expansion from Washington, DC, setting up a showdown. While Hechinger undoubtedly had excellent management and a strong record of historical success, at the time they didn't see that Home Depot was changing the industry's competitive dynamic.</p>
<p>Faced with a competitive player in a number of promising expansion markets, Charles and his team set to work with a comparative analysis of Hechinger and Home Depot and were startled by what they found: What appeared to be similar businesses externally were radically different internally. To do this problem solving the team employed a return on invested capital tree, which turned out to be a powerful problem solving tool. What it showed is that while return on capital was similar for the two businesses, the drivers of success were different. Using publicly available accounting data, <a href="#c03-fig-0006" id="R_c03-fig-0006">Exhibit 3.6</a> shows:</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration of the ROIC tree depicting the analysis of the return on invested capital using publicly available accounting data." src="images/c03ex006.jpg" class="center" width="775" height="997"/>
 <figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c03-fig-0006" id="c03-fig-0006" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 3.6</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure>
<ul id="c03-list-0002">
<li id="c03-li-0004">Home Depot had lower overheads and lower costs of goods sold, but it also had lower gross margins (selling price minus cost of goods)—it was following a low‐cost/low‐price strategy.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0005">Home Depot had much higher asset productivity, meaning it generated more sales per dollar invested, including higher sales per square foot of store space and higher inventory turns.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0006">Home Depot was growing much faster, although it was of similar size in 1983.</li></ul> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="61" id="Page_61" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="62" id="Page_62" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>
<p id="c03-para-0028">Clearly, Home Depot was making up for lower margins by having lower overhead costs and higher asset productivity, generating a similar return to the long‐established Hechinger. The team decided to dig deeper. What it discovered was remarkable. Home Depot was growing so quickly because it had <i>much</i> lower prices. Charles's team conducted secret shopper pricing analysis and found that Home Depot's prices were 15 to 18% lower for comparable products. How could it possibly operate at such low prices?</p>
<p>The ROIC tree was the central framework to guide the analysis. What the team learned was that Home Depot had built a state of the art inventory management system, and had developed a store design that housed inventory on 20‐foot racks on the retail floor (versus Hechinger's 8‐foot racks), therefore doing without backroom storage and labor intensive restocking. Moreover, instead of storing goods mainly in a central company warehouse, it negotiated with suppliers to direct ship to Home Depot stores, or cross‐dock goods (a procedure in which a truck from a supplier is quickly unloaded and the goods go straight to store delivery trucks without being double handled). The team estimated that Home Depot was able to operate with 5–7% less shipping and logistics costs than Hechinger, and negotiate as much as 5% lower costs for the same goods by concentrating volume on orders of fewer retail items (sometimes called stock keeping units, or SKUs).</p>
<blockquote style="color: #d9272e;">
<p id="c03-para-0030">Cross‐docking or breaking up manufacturers' shipments to go to the various stores is undertaken on a small scale, but for the most part, suppliers are more than willing to drop ship to the stores because the individual locations order by the trailer load. Home Depot's average sales per store run around $20 million, or more than double Hechinger's or Builders Square's.</p>
<p class="right"><i>Analyst report, The First Boston Corporation</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="c03-para-0032">So Home Depot was generating the same return on invested capital, but able to make up for much lower prices with a combination of lower distribution costs, cheaper sourcing, lower store and central overheads, and much higher asset productivity. Lower prices were driving much higher sales per store and a much higher company <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="63" id="Page_63" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>growth rate. Trouble had quickly arrived for Hechinger: Could it adopt some of Home Depot's competitive practices and regain its regional lead based on its strong brand?</p>
<p id="c03-para-0033">Although Hechinger tried to lower its costs and increase its asset productivity, over time the differences magnified, and by 1988 the businesses had diverged (see <a href="#c03-fig-0007" id="R_c03-fig-0007">Exhibit 3.7</a>). Home Depot's sales were accelerating as it opened new markets and drove nearly twice the sales per store than Hechinger, and its asset productivity continued to climb.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c03-para-0034">As Hechinger tried to compete with Home Depot's prices, they offered sales and promotions, but—despite the acquisition of Home Quarters, a similar warehouse chain—the company failed to make the deep business model changes required to compete. With new entry on many fronts across 19 states, including their long‐time, dominant Washington, DC home market, they began to close stores. By 1997 Hechinger was out of business<a href="#c03-note-0001" id="R_c03-note-0001"><sup>1</sup></a> (see <a href="#c03-fig-0008" id="R_c03-fig-0008">Exhibit 3.8</a>).</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="64" id="Page_64" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

<p id="c03-para-0037">In the hardware company comparison, the objective of the tree was return on invested capital, and the branches included profitability and asset productivity, drivers that mathematically led to the difference in operating and financial results between competitors Home Depot and Hechinger. This helped us understand the two companies' prospects in the market by highlighting how their two different business models ultimately led to different levels of financial success. (One thing to be careful about in using return on capital trees is that the definition of capital and profit typically employed is an accounting one (so subject to accounting rules on things like depreciation), rather than a cash or replacement cost <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="65" id="Page_65" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="66" id="Page_66" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>definition. You may benefit from cross‐checking your numbers with a replacement cost calculation for core assets like stores and using cash profitability.)</p> </section> <section>

<h3 id="head-3-4"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Case Study: Bay Area Nursing Related Patient Outcomes</span></h3>
<p id="c03-para-0038">To show the clarity deductive logic trees can bring, let's introduce a new example, this time around improving nursing in hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area. Charles observed a team working on this problem at the foundation he worked with. The team wanted to improve nursing‐related patient outcomes in the Bay Area in California. Nurses provide upwards of 90% of patient care in hospitals. More than 100,000 lives a year are lost in the United States from mistakes in patient care from many sources, especially from sepsis, ventilator acquired pneumonia, hospital acquired infections, and medication errors. There is a substantial shortage of nurses in California and beyond, and studies show that for each patient added per registered nurse (RN), mortality rates increase. Every one of us has a lot to gain from making progress on this problem.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0039">Early on in the project the team constructed a relatively straightforward deductive logic tree focused on increasing both the number of skilled nursing graduates, and on improving the skills and practices of existing RNs.</p>
<p>By developing this deductive logic tree, shown as <a id="R_c03-fig-0010" href="#c03-fig-0010">Exhibit 3.10</a>, and more sophisticated versions that followed, the foundation nursing team was able to focus its attention on the key drivers of nursing numbers and skill levels. This allowed the team to use data and analysis to determine which levers were most powerful in improving patient outcomes, and which were cost‐effective to address. They developed a series of strategies to address these levers, including:</p>

<h3 id="head-3-5"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Inductive Logic Trees</span></h3>
<p>Inductive logic trees are the reverse of deductive logic trees. They take their name from the process of inductive reasoning, which <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="68" id="Page_68" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>works <i>from</i> specific observations <i>toward</i> general principles. Here is an example of inductive reasoning:</p>
<ul id="c03-list-0004">
<li id="c03-li-0011">Observation: Sally is a watchmaker and wears glasses.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0012">Observation: Shaun is a watchmaker and wears glasses.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0013">Observation: Steven is a watchmaker and wears glasses.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0014">Inductive assertion: Watchmakers typically wear glasses.</li></ul>
<p id="c03-para-0043">We employ inductive logic trees when we do not yet know much about the general principles behind the problems we are interested in, but we do have some data or insights into specific cases. Inductive trees show probabilistic relationships, not causal ones: Just because all the swans you have seen are white, does not mean all swans are white (there are black swans in Australia.<a href="#c03-note-0002" id="R_c03-note-0002"><sup>2</sup></a>) In many cases you will actually work on your initial tree <i>both</i> inductively and deductively. You will have a sense of some of the bigger drivers and general principles, and you will have good case examples of successful projects in the space you are looking at. So you work both from the trunks of the tree <i>and</i> from the leaves, slowly and iteratively figuring out which is which.</p> </section> <section>

<h3 id="head-3-6"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Case Study: Dealing with Contested Historical Legacies—from Inductive Thinking to a Decision Tree</span></h3>
<p id="c03-para-0044">As we have seen in recent news stories focused on controversial statues and public monuments, there has been a lot of public interest in historical artifacts that chronicle or memorialize historical leaders whose views are out of step with current values, initially sparked by activism on university campuses, but now including municipalities and other institutions. As the head of the Rhodes Trust, one of many institutions with a complicated historical legacy, Charles had been grappling with these issues.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0045">What Charles observed is a lot of ad hoc approaches to each historical artifact. Under pressure from interest groups and external commentators, institutional decision makers have been lurching from decision to decision, and often reversing course, with no <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="69" id="Page_69" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>clear set of principles to guide their actions. Good moral reasoning requires, well, <i>reasons</i>, and Charles thought that the debate would be improved by developing some principles for how to deal with artifacts of historical characters. This is complicated by the fact that even our favorite historical characters held views that we would find abhorrent today. So the framework had to accommodate heroes, such as Frederick Douglass, Thomas Jefferson, Walt Whitman, and Gandhi, not just historical bad guys.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0046">This turns out to be an important insight. The team began an inductive‐reasoning exercise where we took a large range of historical characters about which there is rich information and even some agreement on how to assess them. For example, we compared Thomas Jefferson with the reputations of other presidents who owned slaves, and we looked at the legacies as varied as John C. Calhoun at Yale, to Aulus Plautius, the Roman general who invaded Britain in 43AD. By working backwards from how people think about individuals, the team began to tease out some general principles of judgment. At first all they had was a list of threshold questions that underpinned the judgments or assessments, but no clear hierarchy of what questions were most important, as seen in <a href="#c03-fig-0011" id="R_c03-fig-0011">Exhibit 3.11</a>.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="70" id="Page_70" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

<h2 id="head-2-18"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Step 3: Prioritization—Pruning Your Logic Trees</span></h2>
<p id="c03-para-0058">Good problem solving is just as much about what you don't do as what you do, and good prioritization in problem solving makes solutions come faster and with less effort. We want our initial trees to be MECE, so that we know we have all the parts. But we don't want to retain elements of the disaggregation that have only a small influence on the problem, or that are difficult or impossible to affect. Before we start to invest significant time and effort into work planning and analysis, we have to prune our trees.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0059">We have found the 2×2 matrix in <a href="#c03-fig-0013" id="R_c03-fig-0013">Exhibit 3.13</a> to be a useful forcing device for prioritization of which levers to work on, here shown for the Pacific salmon case study. The left‐hand axis is whether or not your efforts could have an impact on the problem lever or branch. <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="72" id="Page_72" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The bottom axis is how important that lever is in affecting the overall problem you are trying to solve, in this case the impact on salmon abundance and diversity.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration of the 2×2 matrix for prioritization depicting the potential scale of impact versus the ability to influence." src="images/c03ex013.jpg" class="center" width="650" height="645"/>
 <figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c03-fig-0013" id="c03-fig-0013" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 3.13</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c03-para-0060">As you can see from the matrix, some prioritization decisions are relatively straightforward: Even with the resources of a large foundation, our team couldn't hope to influence climactic conditions, which are the main driver of ocean productivity—providing the food for juvenile salmon at sea. Although this lever has a significant impact on salmon diversity and abundance, we have to lop it off.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0061">Second, the impact of hatcheries and “ocean ranching” (putting artificially raised salmon into the ocean hoping they will return to be <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="73" id="Page_73" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>captured) is not insignificant—these fish compete with wild fish for food, and may cause genetic introgression via inbreeding—but in the initial cut at the problem we left it off our priority actions. While there is little evidence of net supplementation or cost‐effective returns, hatcheries are big job providers and have huge support from indigenous groups and sports and commercial fishers. It is a tough lever to move.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0062">As you will see in <a href="#c03-fig-0013">Exhibit 3.13</a>, the team also did not prioritize investments to repair damaged ecosystems in the southern end of the salmon's range. We agonized over this decision, but the cost of restoration compared to the costs of protection of more pristine northern systems was not favorable. And the growing impact of climate change on water temperatures in these southern systems meant there was no guarantee of durability of any results.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0063">In the spirit of iterating steps, it may also be valuable to revisit the problem context to see if relaxing constraints in the problem statement would make a difference to which branches you prune. As the Pacific salmon project progressed through its 15‐year life, we did make targeted investments in limiting the spread and impact of hatcheries, although it never became a major focus. In general, problem definitions with tight constraints on the solution space yield answers more quickly, but sometimes at the expense of creativity. One approach is to relax each constraint and see if the solution set opens up in a substantial enough way to be worth the extra work, time, and investment required to make those options viable.<a href="#c03-note-0004" id="R_c03-note-0004"><sup>4</sup></a></p> </section> <section>
<span id="c03-sec-0011"></span>
<h2 id="head-2-19"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Advanced Class: Using Cleaving Frames to Take Apart Problems</span></h2>
<p id="c03-para-0064">In the previous sections we explored different types of logic trees, the basic structures for problem disaggregation, and problem prioritization. We addressed cases early on in problem <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="74" id="Page_74" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>solving where we only knew enough to break problems into basic factors or levers, or where we had to work inductively from specific cases to move toward general principles of understanding. And we examined problems where we had enough information to drive from specific hypotheses, where we could use deductive logic trees and decision trees. As we saw, there is no absolute right or wrong way to construct trees—aside from aiming for MECE trees—and tree types often overlap. Hypothesis trees can be deductive in logic, and inductive reasoning can generate effective decision trees.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0065">Now we are going to take the conversation to the next level. Expert practitioners of problem solving often employ existing frameworks or theories to more quickly and elegantly cleave problems into insightful parts. We have seen an example of this already with the hardware company competitive battle case study that employed a particular kind of deductive logic tree, a return on capital tree. In fact many business problems benefit from this particular type of problem disaggregation, because it shows the levers of revenue (price, volume, market share), costs (fixed, variable, overheads), and asset utilization so clearly, and in mathematical relationship to each other. This kind of tree also makes “what if” competitive scenario analysis easy. For example, it is easy to model both niche and broad market product strategies, and for your team to debate how realistic the assumptions are that generate results. We often call this kind of work “what you have to believe” analysis.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0066">Just as return on capital trees are often an incredibly insightful type of problem disaggregation for business problems, other theoretical constructs or frameworks can be powerful cleaving tools for other kinds of problems. <a href="#c03-fig-0014" id="R_c03-fig-0014">Exhibit 3.14</a> shows a toolkit of what we call cleaving frames for different kinds of problem. Good problem solvers have toolkits like this that act as lenses to visualize potential solutions. They try on one or more theoretical frames to see which one is likely to be the best fit for the problem at hand. Often they combine more than one frame to make progress on particular <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="75" id="Page_75" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>problems. Let's spend some time highlighting a few of these to make this notion clearer.</p>
<figure><img alt="Tabular chart displaying a  toolkit of cleaving frames, elements, and examples for different kinds of problems." src="images/c03ex014.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="790"/>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Continuing with the focus on business problems for a moment, many company performance and competition questions benefit from a series of frames that help highlight the likely solution paths quickly. <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="76" id="Page_76" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>This list isn't meant to be exhaustive, as many problems combine elements from more than one frame. Some example frames:</p>
<ul id="c03-list-0005">
<li id="c03-li-0015"><b>Price/Volume</b>: One of the key elements of our return on capital tree is the revenue drivers branch that focuses on product pricing and volume. This frame raises questions about the nature of the competitive game: Are there differentiated products or commodities? Are there competitive markets or oligopoly markets controlled by a few players? Each has different dynamics and good business problem solvers build these into their disaggregation and research plans. The kinds of elements here often include assumptions about market share, new product entry, rate of adoption, and price and income elasticities.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0016"><b>Principal/Agent</b>: Principal/agent problems occur where certain activities are done by agents (think contractors or employees) on behalf of principals (think investors or managers), and are very common in business. At the core of this kind of problem is the need to create incentive structures to align the interest of the principal and the agent, when the principal has incomplete visibility or control over the work of the agent. The best structures provide good, checkable results for the investor and fair incomes for the contractor. It sounds easy but it isn't. This kind of problem appears not just in contracting situations, but also in any second‐hand asset sale and in any insurance problem.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0017"><b>Assets/Options</b>: Every asset a company controls, or could purchase, creates options for future strategic moves that may have substantial value. Rob worked for an Australian mining company that asked his team to evaluate an investment in a particular property. What the team discovered was that the investment in the port and the railway infrastructure to exploit that particular property created hugely valuable options for a whole range of other sites. It made his client the “natural owner” (a powerful asset/option concept developed by Rob and another colleague John Stuckey) for other sites worth billions of dollars in option value. This case is outlined in more detail in <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0018"><b>Collaborate/Compete</b>: Any business strategy needs to take account of the potential reaction by rival firms. Each company <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="77" id="Page_77" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>needs to decide where it is willing to engage in intense competition (say based on pricing or large investments) and other cases where it is not, either because of the nature of the market or the nature of the other competitors. The tools and elements in this frame are those from game theory, and include concepts such as multi‐play games and reputation. Our CSIRO Wifi example, shown later, employs this frame to decide whether to go to court to protect intellectual property.</li></ul>
<p>At the level of societal problem solving, in the policy space, there are many other useful frames, shown here in <a id="R_c03-fig-0015" href="#c03-fig-0015">Exhibit 3.15</a>, most of which will be familiar to you.</p>

<ul id="c03-list-0006">
<li id="c03-li-0019"><b>Regulate/Incent:</b> Policy makers often face the choice of adding legal regulation to address a problem, or using taxation, subsidies, or nudging policies that provide incentives for people or <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="78" id="Page_78" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>firms to adopt the desired behavior. This frame frequently comes into play around pollution and other externalities.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0020"><b>Equality/Liberty:</b> Many policy decisions to address social problems face the fundamental frame choice of encouraging more equality among citizens, versus allowing more individual freedom. All policies that involve taxing/spending have elements of this frame.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0021"><b>Mitigate/Adapt:</b> This frame contrasts policy efforts to reduce harm from some causal factor, with efforts to adapt to the factor. This is often the axis in the climate change debate.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0022"><b>Supply/Demand:</b> This frame addresses questions such as “Can we get more?” versus “How can we use less?” and is often the lens employed for dealing with problems like water supply, health care, and energy.</li></ul> <section>
<span id="c03-sec-0012"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-7"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Case Study: Climate Change Abatement and the Cost Curve</span></h3>
<p id="c03-para-0069">Climate change is a particularly thorny problem and often is cleaved around mitigation and adaptation, or incidence and severity (think of Kiribati less than a meter above the ocean!). The cleave Charles and Rob think is particularly powerful is along demand/supply lines where the returns from, or costs of, abating CO<sub>2</sub> are shown by the type of activity and the tons abated. This is called a cost curve, and it reads from left (lower cost) to right (higher costs).<a href="#c03-note-0005" id="R_c03-note-0005"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p id="c03-para-0070">What you see very quickly in <a href="#c03-fig-0016" id="R_c03-fig-0016">Exhibit 3.16</a> is that there are a large number of abatement activities for which there are positive returns to private companies and individuals. This means that a huge amount of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction can occur with good education efforts and perhaps supporting tax credits for the investment costs. There is a second class of actions, mostly in the agriculture and land use space (reforestation, degraded land recovery, avoided deforestation), where the investment costs are relatively small compared to <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="79" id="Page_79" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction benefits. The third bucket captures actions that are longer term and that will require substantial private and social investment in new technology and markets. In our opinion, this cleaving frame provides a useful counterpoint to the mitigate/adapt lens on the problem. When we look only at individual (see <a href="#c03-fig-0017" id="R_c03-fig-0017">Exhibit 3.17</a>) or corporate carbon footprints, we often miss the opportunity to aggregate actions across players and achieve larger results.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="80" id="Page_80" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Problem solving in the individual or personal space can also benefit from cleaving frames. Many of the frames we employ in businesses around investment decisions work equally well for personal decisions, such as Rob's solar panel decision. Other frames useful for personal problem solving include:</p>
<ul id="c03-list-0007">
<li id="c03-li-0023"><b>Work/Play:</b> How much/how long to work set against non‐work interests (for example, when to retire and whether your savings are adequate).</li>
<li id="c03-li-0024"><b>Near term/Long term:</b> Another related category of personal decisions focuses on trading off relatively certain near term decisions (for example, investing in education) against longer‐term and more uncertain future possibilities (what skills will be required in two decades?).</li>
<li id="c03-li-0025"><b>Financial/Non‐Financial:</b> Another cleaving point around decisions like moving to a new house or changing jobs is those elements of the decision that are financial (how much do houses cost in the new city?) versus those that are non‐financial (are the schools good enough?).</li></ul>
<p id="c03-para-0072"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="81" id="Page_81" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The most powerful way to reach a useful disaggregation of a problem is to start with a particular cleaving frame and then do some back of the envelope calculations to confirm that it would provide insight, as the CO<sub>2</sub> abatement cost curve so clearly does to support a supply/demand split.</p>
<p>In an example of this approach, Rob was arguing to his team at The Nature Conservancy Australia (TNCA) that they should focus on Western Sydney to assess the role of <i>urban green spaces</i> in asthma hospitalizations. His hypothesis, based on some early comparative data, was that parks and other green spaces led to lower incidence and severity of asthma. He decided to use the incidence/severity cleaving initially for no other reason than it was a familiar frame for accident and injury reporting on other boards he has served on. He had to make the case to the team that this cut on the asthma problem would be insightful. With available data he was able to show that Western Sydney warranted attention for the following reasons:<a href="#c03-note-0006" id="R_c03-note-0006"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ol class="decimal" id="c03-list-0008">
<li id="c03-li-0026">The incidence of asthma was 10% higher for Western Sydney than Northern Sydney for adults 16 years and over. Australia has among the highest levels of asthma in the OECD.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0027">The severity of asthma, measured by the hospitalization rate was 65% higher in Western Sydney and the death rate from asthma 54% higher—so incidence is higher, but severity is much higher.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0028">Evidence pointed to a lack of urban green spaces as a potential driver of severity. Tree cover in Western Sydney was estimated at 15–20% compared to 30–40% in Northern Sydney. In addition, particulate matter levels (PM2.5 maximum) are 54% higher in Western Sydney. Tree respiration appears to play a role in absorbing particulate matter, a topic we illustrate in <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> in the case of London's air quality.</li></ol>
<p id="c03-para-0074"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="82" id="Page_82" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>As a result, the team is developing an experimental design to systematically explore the green space issues raised by the incidence/severity cleaving.</p>
<p id="c03-para-0075">Again, the point in all of this discussion of using theoretical frameworks or concepts to aid problem disaggregation is to find a cut through your problem that exposes insight. Different frames often yield different insights, so it makes sense to test several. And you can often try a social frame on a business problem, or vice versa. While it is always impressive to watch experienced problem solvers quickly disaggregate difficult problems into insightful chunks, there is also a risk in assuming “I have seen this one before, it is an <i>X</i> problem.” We often see the world via mental models (another term for frames) that have worked for us before. When we encounter genuinely novel problems, we sometimes persist in using frames that are unhelpful or misleading in the new and different context. For centuries, astronomers thought the sun revolved around the earth, and scratched their heads when important navigation problems weren't easy to solve! The next section addresses team processes that can help speed problem solving while avoiding the potholes of false pattern recognition.</p> </section> </section> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-20"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Team Processes in Problem Disaggregation and Prioritization</span></h2>
<p id="c03-para-0076">These problem solving steps benefit substantially from teamwork, and solo practitioners should consider enlisting family or friends to assist them here. Because it is often difficult to see the structure of the problem, team brainstorming is hugely valuable, especially when trying different lenses or cleaving frames. One technique we have both found valuable is to use large yellow Post‐it notes to capture team member ideas on early logic tree elements, as shown in <a id="R_c03-fig-0018" href="#c03-fig-0018">Exhibit 3.18</a>. These can then be moved around on a whiteboard as the order and hierarchy of trunks, branches, twigs, and leaves becomes clearer.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="83" id="Page_83" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting post-it notes pasted over a board, on team processes capturing team member ideas on early logic tree elements." src="images/c03ex018.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="584"/>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c03-para-0077">While it is a good idea to consult the literature and look for best practices around your problem, it is not uncommon for individuals to get attached to their initial cut through the problem, and as mentioned earlier, reliance on external views creates a risk of applying incorrect frames. This is even—or especially—true of experts. Use of constructive challenging and “what you'd have to believe” questions can help get the process out of ruts, and foster more creativity in solution paths. Team brainstorming sessions can really help avoid attachment in problem prioritization. Another technique we have used is giving every team member 10 sticky notes and let them allocate them in a voting process for priority analyses (see <a href="#c03-fig-0019" id="R_c03-fig-0019">Exhibit 3.19</a>).</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="84" id="Page_84" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

<p id="c03-para-0079">Your creativity is often likely to come from how you cleave a problem. Cleaving brings elements of art and science to your problem solving as we show by way of example. In reflecting on how we chose to cleave a problem in a particular way, we have been able to develop a comprehensive list of ways to cleave business problems and those encountered in life.</p> </section> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="85" id="Page_85" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-21"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Chapter 3 Takeaways</span></h2> <ul id="c03-list-0009">
<li id="c03-li-0029">Problem disaggregation is critical to good problem solving; it gives us manageable chunks to work on and allows us to begin to see the structure of the problem.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0030">Start with simple factor or component trees when you are just starting out and don't know much; later, work toward more complete deductive logic trees and decision trees.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0031">It often helps to solve trees backwards, inductively, when you know more about the detailed issues (think of these as the leaves on the tree) than you do about root causes.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0032">See if you can make your tree structures both mutually exclusive (no overlapping branches) and collectively exhaustive (no missing branches).</li>
<li id="c03-li-0033">For business problems it almost always makes sense to start with a profit lever or return on capital tree.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0034">As you get more experienced, try the broader set of cleaving frames from the later part of the chapter; different slices through the problem yield different insights.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0035">Prioritization is really important once you have a good tree structure; try putting all your twigs and leaves on a matrix of the size of potential impact and whether you can affect it. Focus your early efforts on the big levers that you can pull!</li> </ul> </section> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-22"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Problems to Try on Your Own</span></h2>
<ol class="decimal" id="c03-list-0010">
<li id="c03-li-0036">Take a growth opportunity for your business or nonprofit and prepare a logic tree to make the case, first using inductive logic then deductive logic.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0037">Try creating a logic tree for the growth opportunity expressed in arithmetic relationships.</li>
<li id="c03-li-0038"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="86" id="Page_86" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Set up a priorities matrix for the top half dozen priorities in your business plan. Which ones should you ramp up with resources and slow down or terminate based on your assessment?</li>
<li id="c03-li-0039">How else might you cleave the nursing supply problem?</li>
<li id="c03-li-0040">Would you cleave the airport capacity problem in a more compelling way than outlined in <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>?</li> </ol>
