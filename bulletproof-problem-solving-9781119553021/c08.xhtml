<p id="c08-para-0002">As problem solvers, we shuffle through a deck of strategies when we face high uncertainty. We edge into risk, looking for the opportunities to learn before acting precipitously, hedging our bets where we can, and taking steps that build capabilities and future resilience. We know there is value in being systematic and working through a range of potential strategies when faced with uncertainty and long time frames.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0003">As we have seen, the seven‐steps framework is robust and adaptable in addressing a wide range of personal, work, and societal problems. Many of the examples to date exhibit low to moderate uncertainty, where the cost of error is relatively low, and where time frames are relatively short. But there is a class of problems where time periods are long, complexity and uncertainty are high, and the consequences of error are substantial. The case of protecting Pacific salmon that we have looked at in previous chapters is a good example. Outcomes for salmon depend on many variables, including inherently uncertain ones like climate change. Species success plays out over decades rather than months, and the consequences of bad outcomes are broadly felt in human incomes and ecosystem losses. We believe the seven‐steps model is useful for complex problems with high uncertainty, particularly the emphasis on an iterative approach, but we will add some frameworks to our problem solving kit to manage these more difficult, long‐term problems, some of which involve putting the analytic tools of <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> into practice.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0004">In this chapter we define levels of uncertainty and the implications for problem solving. We provide a problem solving toolkit with escalating actions to address different levels of uncertainty. We demonstrate the tools via a number of cases where we have employed these approaches, from long‐term capital investment in resources, to making career choices, to determining whether you risk outliving your savings, and to developing strategies comprising a portfolio of initiatives.</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c08-sec-0002"></span>
<h2 id="head-2-49"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Levels of Uncertainty</span></h2>
<p id="c08-para-0005">There are many ways to understand and evaluate uncertainty, including statistical measures of variability and conditional probability. Previously, we lacked a way to describe and respond to different <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="197" id="Page_197" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>levels of uncertainty, without having to make spot predictions that could dangerously underestimate the range of uncertainty. Several of our former McKinsey colleagues addressed this need with a five‐level schema for assessing uncertainty.<a href="#c08-note-0001" id="R_c08-note-0001"><sup>1</sup></a> They brought new language into play in tailoring actions to uncertainty, such as “big bets” and “no regrets” moves that are now in widespread use. In this model, uncertainty levels range from level 1, what is a reasonably predictable future, to level 5, the unknown unknowns (<a href="#c08-fig-0001" id="R_c08-fig-0001">Exhibit 8.1</a>). Level 1 uncertainty, such as simple predictions and short‐term forecasts, is discussed in earlier chapters and can be addressed with good team processes. More challenging settings are where the level of uncertainty rises to levels 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting the different levels of uncertainty, their definitions and examples in three columns." src="images/c08ex001.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="342"/>
 <figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a id="c08-fig-0001" href="#R_c08-fig-0001" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 8.1</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure> <ul id="c08-list-0001">
<li id="c08-li-0001">Level 2 are situations in which there are alternative futures that could follow from a legislative change or technology change, where the results will be binary in the sense of who wins/loses. The Brexit decision in the UK is an example. Another is how should auto insurers prepare for driverless cars on the road, where the time frame for adoption is uncertain, and the role of carmakers in providing the insurance is unclear. Both of these examples are likely to have uncertainty resolved in a 5‐ to 10‐year time period.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="198" id="Page_198" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Level 3 is where there is a range of futures that are possible but where it isn't clear which one is more likely. Where fossil fuels fit in the energy mix in 15 years is an example. Scenarios range from similar to today all the way to a very diminished role. Another frequently discussed topic is what jobs will we have in the future with advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning and robotics. This will be clearer in a 10‐ to 20‐year time frame.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0003">Level 4 describes true ambiguity, where it is not possible to conceive of all the potential outcomes or to predict them with confidence. You could put the issue of sea levels in Manhattan in 2050 into that category, although some climate scientists will have different views. In an update of “Strategy Under Uncertainty,” author Hugh Courtney gave the example of early‐stage biotech investments having Level 4 uncertainty.<a href="#c08-note-0002" id="R_c08-note-0002"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li id="c08-li-0004">Level 5 is the nearly absolute uncertainty of events that are unpredictable with current knowledge and technology, sometimes called unknown unknowns.</li> </ul>
<p id="c08-para-0006">Uncertainty levels 1 through 4 are colorfully called “the known unknowns,” in contrast to level 5. We don't put them in a too‐hard basket. Instead we approach them recognizing and quantifying the level and type of uncertainty, and then develop approaches to move toward our desired outcomes by managing the levers that we control. The next and harder step is to identify what actions you can take to deal with a particular level of uncertainty.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0007">It is important to remember this as we dive in to this topic: Uncertainty can be a good thing for strategic problem solvers! Hedge fund and other clever investors hope for uncertain and volatile markets—provided they have an analytic edge. If your problem solving is right you can earn good returns and guard your downside while others are floundering.</p> </section> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="199" id="Page_199" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-50"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Logic Trees to Deal with Uncertainty</span></h2>
<p>The spectrum of actions you can take when faced with level 2 to level 4 uncertainty range from buying time (which you can also call do nothing, wait for more information), all the way through to taking big bets and no regrets moves (<a href="#c08-fig-0002" id="R_c08-fig-0002">Exhibit 8.2</a>). You will typically see actions linked to the level of uncertainty as follows.</p>

<ul id="c08-list-0002">
<li id="c08-li-0005"><b>Buying information,</b> which may involve data gathering and analysis of underlying processes, to clarifying the sources of uncertainty and the motives of protagonists.<a href="#c08-note-0003" id="R_c08-note-0003"><sup>3</sup></a> The information for level 3 and 4 uncertainty may be modeling for distant events <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="200" id="Page_200" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>rather than fact gathering of observable things. There is likely to be a high cost of moving toward perfect information and a point at which it is too costly to acquire more information.<a href="#c08-note-0004" id="R_c08-note-0004"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li id="c08-li-0006"><b>Hedges</b> are a way of dealing with uncertainty that involves making a reasonable cost move or investment that will counter downside events. An example is fossil fuel companies investing in renewable energy. Other examples of hedges involve buying water rights in areas expected to have lower rainfall with climate change. Sometimes these can involve options, futures contracts, or other financial instruments—although few financial hedging mechanisms are as long‐lasting as many difficult problems require.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0007">Acquiring <b>low‐cost strategic options</b> through a portfolio of initiatives, or betting on multiple horses in the race, is another way we deal with uncertainty. Major financial institutions are investing relatively small equity stakes in financial technology (fintech) start‐up companies to be in a position where they can first understand and then capitalize on innovation that challenges established players. We saw how important information gathering is in times of disruptive technologies in our newspaper versus new media example in <a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>. These are typically low‐cost options, and often involve bets on competing technologies. How IBM lost the PC business is put down to a failure to exercise the low‐cost options it held in its key suppliers. “Early on IBM had the financial resources to take a large equity position in both Intel and Microsoft. It did make an investment in Intel in 1982, getting a 20% equity stake and warrants to purchase another 10%. But, ironically, IBM sold out in 1986 and 1987 for $625 million. Ten years later that 20% stake would have been worth $25 billion. As for Microsoft, IBM had an opportunity to buy 30% of Microsoft for under $300 million in mid‐1986. By the end of 1996 that $300 million investment would have been worth $33 billion.”<a href="#c08-note-0005" id="R_c08-note-0005"><sup>5</sup></a> That is just the financial investment loss—the loss in learning value is incalculable.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0008"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="201" id="Page_201" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><b>Buying insurance.</b> The threat of global warming is sometimes framed as an insurance problem, with estimates that a little over 1% of global GDP has to be committed to paying the annual premium to keep CO<sub>2</sub> levels below a 2‐degree centigrade increase. That hasn't happened to date but there is some progress toward international agreements that would move toward this. There are also insurance products for a range of uncertain situations, known as cat bonds or catastrophe bonds, that cover events like typhoons or hurricanes.</li></ul>
<ul id="c08-list-0003">
<li id="c08-li-0009"><b>No regrets moves</b> come into play when you are comfortable with the level of uncertainty, or can edge out into a competitive space with incremental learning moves; this often involves the capability building you'll need no matter what the outcome.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0010"><b>Big bets</b> are taken when you have a level of confidence about an outcome not shared by others. <i>The Big Short</i> book and film, describing the investments in shorting subprime mortgage credit default swaps in the US, is a great example of a big bet when uncertainty remained high.<a href="#c08-note-0006" id="R_c08-note-0006"><sup>6</sup></a> The investors spotlighted in the book felt the mortgage securities were mispriced and took big bets when others weren't prepared to. Of course, big bets can also go bad when uncertainty resolves itself in ways that leave an asset investment stranded. For example the generous feed in tariffs for Spanish solar investment a decade ago looked to be too good to be true. In this case the assumptions made about the behavior of host governments turned out to be incorrect. Where uncertainty sits at level 2 or greater, most decision makers will seek to defer irreversible commitments. That can work in the absence of competition but becomes a more difficult equation where there is the possibility of preemption. Big bets are open only to a few, as Hugh Courtney pointed out—those with business models that generate a lot of cash and have low debt. They can be shaping winning strategies, as a recent book by some of our former colleagues demonstrates.<a href="#c08-note-0007" id="R_c08-note-0007"><sup>7</sup></a></li> </ul>
<p id="c08-para-0009"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="202" id="Page_202" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>When we can estimate the parameters of uncertainty, mathematics can help us calculate what is a fair bet and estimate the value of different options. We can estimate conditional probabilities through experiments and sampling, and we can use joint probabilities to estimate complex risks involved in a decision. All this requires <i>thinking probabilistically</i>, a term a statistics colleague of Rob's uses. In her view, our inherent biases in decision making make us reasonably bad at this without systems and good mathematical discipline. She calls humans “the unintuitive statistician.”<a href="#c08-note-0008" id="R_c08-note-0008"><sup>8</sup></a> As we know from <a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, we can fight these biases with good processes and team norms.</p> </section> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-51"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Case Examples of Long Time Frames and Uncertainty</span></h2>
<p>Now that we have a framework for assessing uncertainty levels and some actions for addressing risky situations, let’s look at a range of individual, business, and societal level cases to see how strategies under uncertainty come together. The cases we cover are as follows:</p>
<ol class="decimal" id="c08-list-0004">
<li id="c08-li-0011"><b>How to make education and career choices when the jobs available in 20 to 30 years' time are uncertain in nature and scope</b>. The impact of automation and advances in human level machine intelligence (HLMI) will have an impact on jobs, both positively and negatively. Some forecasts will prove to be right and others horribly wrong. How do you navigate your way through educational investment and career decisions now to avoid a high cost of error and have a good chance of realizing your career goals? Our team of young Oxford researchers encouraged us to tackle this problem. Career choice has elements of level 3 and even level 4 uncertainty.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0012"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="203" id="Page_203" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><b>How to plan for far horizon events: Will I outlive my savings?</b> This is one of the highest uncertainty events we face as individuals. It's a relatively recent problem as people used to retire at 65 and have a life expectancy of 72. Now they often retire at 60 and live to 85 or more. Probability assessment is a key part of tackling this level 2 issue.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0013"><b>How you make really long‐term investments with growth options</b>. Long time frames for investments like infrastructure call for particular attention to uncertainty and the role of development options. We take a resource company investment example at a level 3 uncertainty to illustrate how our tools are put to work. This is one where Rob can look back and see how it played out over more than two decades.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0014"><b>How you build new businesses with a staircase strategy approach</b>. Where you set out to build new businesses in rapidly changing environments, there is a need for a step‐by‐step approach that simultaneously buys information to reduce uncertainty and builds new capabilities to reduce risk. Charles and Rob developed this approach with colleagues at McKinsey.<a href="#c08-note-0009" id="R_c08-note-0009"><sup>9</sup></a> It has proved valuable to large businesses and start‐ups. It features level 2 uncertainty.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0015"><b>How a complex portfolio of strategies in a highly uncertain environment are constructed</b>. High uncertainty settings often require selecting multiple paths to a long‐term goal and making trade‐offs among strategies as the real world unfolds. Charles used these techniques at the Moore Foundation when managing a large portfolio of grants that employed often‐competing strategies to preserve Pacific salmon. The issues here were mostly level 3 and 4 uncertainty.</li></ol>
<p id="c08-para-0011">Let's look at each of these case studies.</p> </section> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="204" id="Page_204" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <section>
<span id="c08-sec-0005"></span>
<h2 id="head-2-52"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Case Study: How Should I Choose My Career?</span></h2>
<p id="c08-para-0012">As automation’s and artificial intelligence's roles in the workplace expand at ever increasing rates, predictions for the labor market have many facets of uncertainty compared to 25 or 50 years ago.<a href="#c08-note-0010" id="R_c08-note-0010"><sup>10</sup></a> The tailwinds are around mostly non‐routine, cognitive jobs that didn't exist 10 years ago—you may have seen the World Economic Forum new jobs list: app developer, social media manager, driverless car engineer, cloud‐computing specialist, big‐data analyst, sustainability manager, YouTube content creator, drone operator, millennial generation expert. In 10 years the list will be different again.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0013">So as a young person choosing a career, how would you best position yourself in this changing labor landscape? First, we build a tree to capture the economic labor landscape (<a href="#c08-fig-0003" id="R_c08-fig-0003">Exhibit 8.3</a>). It shows clearly that the employment share of non‐routine cognitive jobs is growing, as are non‐routine manual jobs, while routine cognitive and routine manual job shares are shrinking in share of employment.</p>

<p id="c08-para-0014">You can use your inside knowledge about your personal level of ability, interests, and risk tolerance to guide your education and career choice decisions. Jeff Wald, the cofounder and president of WorkMarket asks, “What are you passionate about? Does that map to what skill sets are needed?”<a href="#c08-note-0011" id="R_c08-note-0011"><sup>11</sup></a> To do this, we begin with a simple chart to fill in. Each horizontal row in the chart represents a broad potential field or sector in which you may end up working; there are four vertical columns: The first is the current economic predictions for the field, the next are your personal assessments of your ability, interest, and ability to take risks. The first column can be completed and updated using economic predictions.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0015"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="205" id="Page_205" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>For each potential field, subject area, or employment sector, you fill in your self‐assessed strength, interest, and risk‐tolerance levels in the second, third, and fourth columns. You can choose low, medium, or high, to rank your preferences. <a id="R_c08-fig-0004" href="#c08-fig-0004">Exhibit 8.4</a> shows a filled‐in matrix for one of our research team members.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="206" id="Page_206" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

<p>Now how does this information help lead you to a decision? You can start by eliminating or pruning sectors in which you have low strength or abilities and low interest. Beginning with the most promising sector, the sectors for which you have the highest interest and ability, you can use this tree to guide your next step or action. We define three potential strategies or actions:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0005">
<li id="c08-li-0016">Make a <b>big bet</b> and embark on a path with considerable risk.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0017">Make a <b>no regrets move</b> and gain a base level of education or training in a safe field that safeguards you from risk.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0018"><b>Hedge your bet</b> by investing time and energy in education or training for two or more fields or positions.</li></ul> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="207" id="Page_207" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>
<p id="c08-para-0017"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="208" id="Page_208" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Within these strategies you can see two broad paths: one entrepreneurial and the other educational. When faced with high ability, high interest, high risk tolerance, and high economic opportunity, entrepreneurship may be calling out your name. However, it is often more likely that all your stars may not be in perfect alignment; in this case, you may need to make a no regrets move and obtain a base of education, or choose to hedge your bets across two fields with strategies such as double majoring or continued education while working.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0018"><a id="R_c08-fig-0005" href="#c08-fig-0005">Exhibit 8.5</a> illustrates these strategic choices.</p>

<span id="c08-sec-0006"></span>
<h2 id="head-2-53"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Case Study: Will My Retirement Savings Last?</span></h2>
<p>At the other end of life planning, we also find uncertainty. In the past, retirement savings typically only needed to last 10–15 years. Now the need for retirement income is often stretching out to 25–35 years, where early retirement is taken and longevity is improving. Many retirees now face the question “Will my retirement savings last?” The answer to this question depends on the longevity runway you're on <i>and</i> the income pool you can generate, as well as your risk preferences (see <a id="R_c08-fig-0006" href="#c08-fig-0006">Exhibit 8.6</a>). As life expectancy increases, and returns on conventional savings remain modest, an increasing number of people risk outliving their savings. On the minds of people approaching retirement are these questions:</p>
<figure> <img alt="A timeline illustration of financial planning as to how long retirement savings last as a case study." src="images/c08ex006.jpg" class="center" width="272" height="625"/><figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c08-fig-0006" id="c08-fig-0006" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 8.6</b></a></span></p>

</section> <section>
<ul id="c08-list-0006">
<li id="c08-li-0019">How should I plan for this uncertainty?</li>
<li id="c08-li-0020">Are there actions to take now to mitigate this risk?</li>
<li id="c08-li-0021"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="209" id="Page_209" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Are there decisions that can be deferred to a later point in time?</li>
<li id="c08-li-0022">Do I need to go beyond my financial planner or accountant for advice?</li></ul>
<p id="c08-para-0021">We admit this isn't the kind of issue you want to deal with every day, but there is a way to do it simply and comprehensively. It requires you to estimate your longevity runway, adjust for bias, and take a view on your risk preferences in investment strategy.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0022">We start with a first‐cut calculation to solve this problem. In order to work out whether you face a risk, you can simply calculate how <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="210" id="Page_210" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>far your retirement nest egg will go, measured in years of target income, and compare that to how long you can expect to live given your age. This can be as simple as dividing your retirement savings by your target retirement income less expenses, adjusting for any defined benefit pensions. That is your years of retirement runway.<a href="#c08-note-0012" id="R_c08-note-0012"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p id="c08-para-0023">This heuristic is a good starting point to understanding your situation but doesn't provide the whole answer. Why? By definition, not everyone is going to reach average life expectancy and individuals have different risk tolerance. Also, your nest egg can be invested in different assets that earn more or less, and that have more or less volatility. The analysis needs to be taken further than the heuristic in order to account for these factors.</p> <section>
<span id="c08-sec-0007"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-22"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Sketch Out Your Longevity Runway</span></h3>
<p id="c08-para-0024">Let's look at your longevity runway more closely. If you are a healthy 35‐year‐old, your life expectancy is 80 years, but if you make it to 60, the average life expectancy increases to 82.8 years.<a href="#c08-note-0013" id="R_c08-note-0013"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>At age 60, there is a 50% chance of:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0007">
<li id="c08-li-0023">A male exceeding 85</li>
<li id="c08-li-0024">A female exceeding 88</li>
<li id="c08-li-0025">At least one of a male and female couple together exceeding 91<a href="#c08-note-0014" id="R_c08-note-0014"><sup>14</sup></a></li></ul>
<p id="c08-para-0026"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="211" id="Page_211" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Planning is typically done for couples, and what is relevant is the age at death of the surviving partner. It is another case where the <i>joint probability</i> is the relevant calculation, and you can find tables online for this joint‐longevity question. In this case, the likelihood of one or the other living to over 90 is 50%, a 30‐year planning runway, almost as long as a working life that starts at 22 and finishes at 60! The irony is that people tend to underestimate their life expectancy by upward of 4 years.<a href="#c08-note-0015" id="R_c08-note-0015"><sup>15</sup></a> If you have grandparents who are in their 90s, your life expectancy increases. If you have a healthy lifestyle, it is higher again. If you live in a town with high environmental quality, it reduces respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses and other diseases. If your runway has all the positives, you need to be planning to live longer.</p> </section> <section>

<h3 id="head-3-23"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Consider Your Risk Tolerance</span></h3>
<p id="c08-para-0027">Volatility around investment returns for your retirement account movements creates income uncertainty. Different individuals will have different risk tolerance for how to handle this uncertainty. If you believe you will have high longevity and you have low risk tolerance for depleting your savings, then you could consider buying an annuity that covers your lifetime and making adjustments to your budget to balance spending to income. Buying an annuity is a classic insurance policy to handle uncertainty. You get peace of mind around having savings that last a lifetime with an annuity, but trade that certainty off with lower returns. On the other hand, if you anticipate living a long life and have a tolerance for risk, you should consider holding a growth portfolio for investing, rather than what is termed a balanced fund.</p> </section> <section>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c08-para-0029">There is a surprising conclusion here that we need to explain. It has to do with longevity and compounding. Most financial planners we know recommend balanced funds for clients approaching retirement that provide a measure of safety against stock market volatility to provide stable current income, typically for investors with a 10‐ to 20‐year investment horizon. But what if that investment horizon at age 60 is 25 years or even 35 years? The simple table below helps to show why the duration period of an investment and the power of compounding returns are so important.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0030">The returns from a growth fund are 34% higher for the 25‐year period and a staggering 51% higher if the investment period is 35 years (<a href="#c08-fig-0008" id="R_c08-fig-0008">Exhibit 8.8</a>). But you have to have some tolerance for greater annual variability in income after retirement. The point is we have uncovered a different way to think about the problem of the adequacy of retirement savings, one that may feel counterintuitive. Moreover, starting down this problem solving path allows a retiree at 60 to switch funds if their circumstances change, such as having a need for income earlier. On the other hand, you're unlikely to make <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="213" id="Page_213" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>a switch from a balanced fund at 80+, when the longevity runway is shortening.</p>

<p id="c08-para-0031">We have reached a conclusion here that you won't hear from many financial planners, to consider investing for growth as you enter retirement if you expect a long life for yourself or your partner. When we add risk tolerance, a different strategy emerges than hedging by buying annuities. Heuristics like a longevity runway and compound growth get us to a rich solution set to an all too real problem. There is also the need for many to increase their savings rate to extend the runway. That should be addressed along with asset allocation to avoid outliving your savings.</p> </section> </section> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-54"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Case Study: How to Make Really Long‐Term Investments</span></h2>
<p id="c08-para-0032">Investments like bridges, mines, roads, and infrastructure have long lives. There is uncertainty over the future operating environment that has to be factored in to the problem solving up front. There is the need to deal with a range of possible outcomes, which <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="214" id="Page_214" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>often requires flexibility to address the value of future development options that are either enabled or blocked by the decision today (another kind of conditional probability). We have chosen to illustrate how to address these issues with a real example of how the giant Australian company BHP approached making a long‐term investment in a mining venture in the past.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0033">Resource companies seek to find or acquire reserves that are low on the cost curve (a tool we introduced in <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> with the climate change abatement cost curve), high quality, and have long lives. This is easy to say but hard to do in practice. Low‐cost suppliers like BHP expect to be able to sell their output in good times and bad. And they usually have to plan on real prices declining, as they have for the past century. Rob led a team advising BHP on the acquisition of a major mining asset that was low cost, high grade, and that had more than 50 years of life. The problem solving approach had two distinctive features to deal with long time frames and the associated uncertainty. One was to define the key uncertainties related to drivers of value of the mine, such as price and volume. The other involved the use of scenarios to model the range of possibilities.</p> <section>
<span id="c08-sec-0011"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-25"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Value Including Development Options</span></h3>
<p id="c08-para-0034">The team developed a typical valuation tree for BHP by estimating net cash flows from the existing mine and discounting them at the cost of capital.<a href="#c08-note-0016" id="R_c08-note-0016"><sup>16</sup></a> You will note that this tree is similar to the return on investment trees we developed for Truckgear and Hechinger in earlier chapters. The math is straightforward and you can find online net present value (NPV) spreadsheets in Excel and other software tools. The cost of capital was based on the risk profile of the project, the cost of raising capital for BHP, and assumptions made about terminal value for a declining resource.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="215" id="Page_215" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>
<p id="c08-para-0035">The tree Rob's team used for this analysis has an additional branch that we termed the <i>value of development options</i> (<a href="#c08-fig-0009" id="R_c08-fig-0009">Exhibit 8.9</a>). We added it because we cleaved the problem around existing assets <i>and</i> future growth or development options. What made the development options so important in this instance was that they could be brought “into the money” at a relatively low exercise price. Why was this the case? It was because they were able to piggyback the infrastructure of rail and port facilities already in place for the existing mine. Whenever you are valuing long‐lived assets in uncertain situations, think about what future projects are made easier or harder by the moves you make today—sometimes these can have more value than the immediate decision at hand.</p>

</figure>
<p id="c08-para-0036"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="216" id="Page_216" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Four major uncertainties had to be addressed to estimate the net present value in this case: the world price for the mineral, the Australian exchange rate versus the US dollar, the volume of ore production, and the value of development options. The volume of ore is in a much smaller range of variation than the other factors, so received less attention in the analysis. There is a range of future outcomes that make it level 3 uncertainty.</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c08-sec-0012"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-26"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Scenarios for Major Uncertainties</span></h3>
<p id="c08-para-0037">The use of scenarios in commodity forecasting and resource investment has a long history and predates the study Rob led. Nowadays large‐scale computing has made it easier to run large Monte Carlo simulations, and to more accurately measure the value of options using Black–Scholes and other valuation approaches.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0038">Our approach was simpler. We had time pressure from the competitive auction for the asset, and we were confident we could address the uncertainties without the need for a large‐scale simulation model. We looked at the demand/supply balance on the world ore market 10 years out in order to generate a range of price forecasts. These were based on how the industry cost curve (supply curve) would look in the future based on current and expected cost positions, reserves coming on stream, and opportunities to reduce costs. A range of demand estimates for the commodity 10 years forward was overlaid against the cost curve to generate a likely pricing band. We also considered extreme cases, such as a price level two standard deviations lower and two standard deviations higher, cases that have 95% confidence intervals.<a href="#c08-note-0017" id="R_c08-note-0017"><sup>17</sup></a> We overlaid a range of foreign exchange rate assumptions, as financial hedging wasn't possible 10 years out. We were then able to put together a matrix of net present value calculations for the price, volume, and exchange rate assumptions (see <a id="R_c08-fig-0010" href="#c08-fig-0010">Exhibit 8.10</a>).</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="217" id="Page_217" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c08-para-0039">Displaying the results of our analysis in the payoff table allowed discussion with the client of how they felt about the assumptions, particularly where we ended up in the best‐guess range. Importantly, it put on the table for consideration the possibility that there was a truly worst‐case disaster, where price fell precipitously and the real exchange rate appreciated strongly. This combination was considered highly unlikely but not impossible. The disaster case is another joint probability instance—what is the likelihood of prices plummeting <i>and</i> the exchange rate being extremely unfavorable. If each has a 10% chance of occurring, the joint probability of both events is only 1%. The same is true of what we called the bonanza case. This is a case where the price is two standard deviations above the mean and where the exchange rate is highly competitive.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0040"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="218" id="Page_218" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>You might say why only look at 10 years out with a 50+ year life asset? We felt it was a conservative approach to valuation in an uncertain and cash‐constrained environment. We incorporated a terminal‐value estimate by discounting the cash flows after year 10 at a much higher cost of capital (20%), compared to 10% for the first 10 years. We ended up being comfortable in recommending the acquisition, as the NPV of the initial asset purchase was higher than the purchase price under all likely scenarios.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0041">We have discussed biases to good problem solving at length. Large‐scale investments, such as company or major asset acquisition, are ones where biases can creep in, particularly confirmation bias. People get excited in auction situations and want to win the bidding contest. Besides the analytic efforts to use scenarios, good problem structuring, and sensitivity analysis, we had a team environment where the client was genuinely seeking a dispassionate external view as input to a board of directors' decision. On the team, we had analytical strength with proponents, and a divergent view from one team member who took the antithesis perspective. These were our efforts to address confirmation bias and realistic worst cases, similar to what we suggest in <a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0042"><i>Look backs</i> are a tool corporations use to assess how robust their capital‐investment processes are. Our team did an informal look back on this proposal 20 years later from public sources and concluded that Rob's original team had been very conservative. We didn't anticipate the China resource boom that came 20 years later. The resource boom changed both the price and volume received for the commodity dramatically. This made the value of the development options attached to the acquisition of enormous value, such that something close to a bonanza scenario was the actual outcome.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0043">In this case, the value of further development options is an important way to ameliorate the risks of uncertainty. In BHP's case, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="219" id="Page_219" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>development options were estimated to be 22% of the NPV of the acquisition, an important component but one that our look back showed was far too conservative (<a href="#c08-fig-0011" id="R_c08-fig-0011">Exhibit 8.11</a>). In hindsight, we estimate the value created was in the order of billions of dollars above the value of the core mining asset BHP acquired.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="220" id="Page_220" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

<p id="c08-para-0044">There are many ways to develop company strategies, depending on the industry context and company characteristics. Michael Porter's 5‐Forces map or the McKinsey Structure‐Conduct‐Performance model looks at industry dynamics to evaluate entry.<a href="#c08-note-0018" id="R_c08-note-0018"><sup>18</sup></a> Dixit and Nalebuff focus on mapping competitive game evolution,<a href="#c08-note-0019" id="R_c08-note-0019"><sup>19</sup></a> like our CSIRO example from <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>. The framework we introduce here, which we call <i>growth staircases</i> (or <i>horizons,</i> in some publications), is directed at determining the steps that allow successful companies to edge out into new businesses in uncertain environments, and emphasizes learning, buying options, and building capabilities.</p>
<p>The origins of the staircases and horizons framework were when Charles, Rob, and McKinsey colleagues were trying to come to grips with a new business growth aspiration for an energy client.<a href="#c08-note-0020" id="R_c08-note-0020"><sup>20</sup></a> We marshaled a number of cases of how companies had built valuable new businesses in a little over a decade. We started drawing out the initiatives they took to enter markets, hire skilled people in unfamiliar areas, and make acquisitions, as steps on a staircase. We analyzed what steps were taken in what order to build capabilities, add assets, and reduce uncertainty. The staircase approach we visually set out involves:</p>
<ul id="c08-list-0008">
<li id="c08-li-0026">Working backward from a planned outcome, thinking through the capabilities, assets, and business learning required to be successful.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0027">Taking a step‐by‐step approach to strategic moves, allied to the uncertainty level, expanding commitment as uncertainty is reduced.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0028">Framing in time the staircase steps, knowledge captured, and capabilities that are being built.</li></ul>
<p id="c08-para-0046"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="221" id="Page_221" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>To illustrate, one of our favorite examples of staircase strategies is the way J&amp;J built a global contact lens business in a little over a decade.

<p id="c08-para-0047">It's one thing to see a staircase in hindsight like J&amp;J's, but how do you go about building one from scratch? How do you deal with uncertainty about the success of staircase steps and competitor action? <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="222" id="Page_222" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>We outline the approach with a discussion of staircase architecture and an example of a staircase under construction.</p> <section>
<span id="c08-sec-0014"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-27"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Staircase Architecture</span></h3>
<p>There are three considerations in staircase architecture:</p>
<ol class="decimal" id="c08-list-0009">
<li id="c08-li-0029"><b>Stretch:</b> The distance of the step‐out from the established platform, the complexity of new capabilities targeted by a step‐out including the degree of integration required. Whether the stretch is too great is a balance between the ability to absorb new skills and the competitive demand for speed to establish market presence.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0030"><b>Momentum:</b> The positive effect of early success, often based on small moves, on the learning and confidence of the organization. Momentum becomes a critical factor in markets that feature increasing returns to scale, involve de facto standard setting, or where winners take all.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0031"><b>Flexibility:</b> Maintaining fluidity in the face of uncertainty has several features, including picking step‐outs that generate the greatest option value for follow‐on initiatives and being prepared to run more than one horse in the race, as we discussed in the Pacific salmon strategy example. Part of maintaining flexibility is avoiding creating sunk assets that could later become stranded. This can be achieved by variable cost structures like contracting and outsourcing.</li></ol>
<p id="c08-para-0049">Staircase architecture involves bringing these three considerations together to work through choices about staircase steps and how they are sequenced (<a href="#c08-fig-0013" id="R_c08-fig-0013">Exhibit 8.13</a>). Teams have to debate the trade‐offs between smaller versus larger steps, option‐laden moves versus focused commitments (that may be better at blocking competitors), and the speed of moves that can create momentum—but may be challenging to integrate with the existing business. The usual techniques of role‐playing and competitor assignment enrich the team discussion of the planning of staircase steps to be taken. Google has investments in hundreds of new ventures. <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="223" id="Page_223" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>That's an approach where they place many small and medium bets in interesting spaces, and often multiple horses in the same race. By contrast, a start‐up may have one route to market with no more than a couple of options, a focused commitment necessitated by available venture funding.</p>

<h3 id="head-3-28"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Staircase Under Construction: Ripper Group Example</span></h3>
<p id="c08-para-0050">Staircases can be used by start‐ups to map the business goals and to show the desired strategic path to get there with learning steps and capability building. The value of working backward then forward is to gain agreement on what capabilities need to be built, and in what order. Consistent with having one‐day answers and iterating in the seven steps the aim is to agree in detail on the staircase steps for the next 12–18 months, take stock, and then plan the next 12–18 months as new information on the market and the capability <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="224" id="Page_224" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>trajectory come to hand. The end goal or its timing is then altered to reflect the market and competitive realities. Agile development, failing fast, and sprints are the hallmarks of this approach to strategic problem solving.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0051">The Ripper Group shark‐spotting algorithm was discussed in <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>. Ripper is an Australia‐based company started by Kevin Weldon, who was president of International Surf Life Saving, and Paul Scully‐Power, the first Australian to journey into space. Ripper's goal is to be a global leader in emergency services employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones, building from their current competence in beach life saving toward flood rescue and damage assessment, and bushfire fire detection and response. National security events and other natural disasters fall within their scope.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0052">Their initial staircase steps for Ripper are similar to those faced by most new ventures—start with a paying customer and seek to bootstrap its way to building operational capability (see <a id="R_c08-fig-0014" href="#c08-fig-0014">Exhibit 8.14</a>). Make some early judgments about the ecosystem you are in and how you plan to compete. In this case they chose to have a customer focus around emergency services, based on having distinctive operational capability, and to have a software rather than hardware focus.</p>
<figure> <img alt="Illustration of ripper group staircase from the years 2016 to 2020 on a platform of capabilities and assets." src="images/c08ex014.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="584"/>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c08-para-0053">The Ripper Group views itself as a player in an ecosystem of early‐stage customers, regulators, hardware suppliers, and software and data analytics. This has taken them down a path of collaboration with the principal regulator to address issues of safety and performance, such as operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) and night flights. In order to fulfill their mission of saving lives on beaches, they collaborated with machine‐learning scientists to develop the world's first shark‐spotter algorithm, software that distinguishes drone data streaming between a person, a dolphin, and a shark, a visual of which we showed in <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0054">Their staircase shows the foundations and capabilities they have built in a couple of years and the major moves they plan to reach <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="225" id="Page_225" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>the goal set by 2020. In an arena where entry barriers are currently low, they are focused on building a reputation as trusted operators who are able to take on the most difficult assignments. This requires that they continue to build capabilities related to flight operations, payloads, and data analytics. They are responding to opportunities in related vertical markets such as the risks mines face with tailings dams, asset inspections for utilities where flood or fire damage has occurred, and agriculture use of drones for weed control. Uncertainty is level 2 or 3, as regulation on drone use could encourage or curtail market potential.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0055">Further out on the Ripper Group staircase are measured steps, incomplete at this point as you might expect, to achieve global sales and distribution. Other steps are to deepen cloud and analytics skills so they have distinctive technology capabilities. The Ripper <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="226" id="Page_226" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Group is invited regularly to go to other countries and replicate what they are doing in Australia. At this point they have neither the resources nor the time to do that without local partners. One idea is to follow the lead of other software suppliers and provide a package of software and operational capability that they call <i>drone in a box</i> for emergency services. International customers have the opportunity to visit their training academy to test out payloads for different applications and be trained in innovations such as BVLOS, LIDAR, non‐GPS flights, and the use of ML algorithms in emergency services.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0056">Staircases allow visualization of a growth plan, with active debate about the size and scope of staircase steps. They are planned in line with reducing uncertainty over time of the market evolution and regulatory environment so that the enterprise doesn't get ahead of itself. Flexibility is built‐in: As new information comes to light, for example, on regulation like BVLOS or night flights, the staircase is redrawn. Similarly, early success with international sales may lead to accelerating global rollout of products like the beach of the future we described in <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</p> </section> </section> <section>

<p id="c08-para-0057">The longest term and most uncertain problems to solve are those in the social and environmental space. Our Pacific salmon case, which Charles worked on for a dozen years, is a great example. The scale of the problem was literally oceanic (covering four countries and the entire North Pacific ocean) and multidecadal, and affected whole ecosystems—for which Pacific salmon are an apex or foundational species—and huge numbers of people, both in livelihoods and culture. This is a big one!</p>
<p id="c08-para-0058">The tools we introduced in earlier chapters are entirely applicable here, and the team made frequent iterative use of them over the fifteen‐year project. But some other tools, particularly related to managing portfolios of strategies, were also important to cracking a problem of this scale.

<h3 id="head-3-29"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Theory of Change Map</span></h3>
<p id="c08-para-0059">For large, multiyear problems it is important to have an overall theory of change (TOC)—the strategic map for visualizing social or environmental change at this scale. In the case of the Pacific salmon team Charles worked with, that TOC map was an evolved variant of the logic tree introduced in <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="228" id="Page_228" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>
<p id="c08-para-0060">As you can see in <a id="R_c08-fig-0015" href="#c08-fig-0015">Exhibit 8.15</a>, this map summarized the team's overall strategy for preserving salmon and salmon ecosystem function at the North Pacific scale. This included strategies for (1) preserving habitat integrity, (2) neutralizing the threat from open‐net pen aquaculture, (3) mitigating the impact of hatchery propagation, and (4) ensuring sustainable fisheries management. Those high‐level strategies led to more than 300 grants to nearly 100 organizations over a decade and a half—a lot of detail to manage.</p> </section> <section>

<p id="c08-para-0061">One of the ways the team managed and communicated about the large portfolio of strategies and investments was to visualize them in a matrix that captures both the stage of investment and the level of aspiration, expressed as incremental or transformational change (see <a id="R_c08-fig-0016" href="#c08-fig-0016">Exhibit 8.16</a>).</p>

<p>The team wanted to balance the investments it was making in Pacific salmon ecosystems across the logical stages of change:</p>
<ol class="decimal" id="c08-list-0010">
<li id="c08-li-0032"><b>Seed:</b> Those strategies designed to create early conditions for change, which included some fundamental science investments to build understanding among government management agencies, early‐stage habitat protection investments based on land planning and First Nations' ownership rights, and mobilizing a base of support for other long‐term change efforts.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0033"><b>Cultivation:</b> Those strategies where interest groups had come to the table and were willing to work together on solutions for both ecosystems and economic users. These are mostly investments in multi‐stakeholder negotiations to change older status quo resource harvest regimes.</li>
<li id="c08-li-0034"><b>Harvest:</b> Those investments to cement conservation gains and solidify institutional support for new conservation centered resource management processes.</li></ol>
<p id="c08-para-0063"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="229" id="Page_229" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>And the team wanted balance between those initiatives that had transformational aspirations—expensive and risky—and those that aimed for incremental but important change.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0064">This visualization of a complex portfolio made it easy to see if the balance was off relative to the Foundation's values, which would have been true for a set of only high‐investment, high‐risk strategies, on the one hand, or a set of sensible workaday approaches that would only lead to incremental change, on the other. It was an effective picture for trading off the risks of individual strategies against others, and for communicating the overall risk and return profile to the Foundation's trustees and senior decision makers.</p> </section> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="230" id="Page_230" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <section>

<h3 id="head-3-31"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Managing Regional and Topical Strategies</span></h3>
<p id="c08-para-0065">With a problem at this large scale, each of the individual regional or topical strategies required its own logical disaggregation, prioritization, and strategy mapping. To give a concrete example, one of the regional Pacific salmon strategies that Charles worked on was in Northern British Columbia, centered on the massive Skeena River watershed.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0066">The Skeena has a very long history of sustainable aboriginal fisheries before European fishers turned up—and a very contested one since then, with different types of fishers fighting for share, and also conflict between federal and provincial fisheries management agencies. In recent decades, this conflict has been set against a backdrop of declining salmon runs and difficult economic conditions for resource users. The federal government had developed a science‐based management policy for salmon fisheries, but failed to implement it. Conflict grew as access to salmon and the salmon economy was constrained for fishers, and as environmental groups ramped up pressure on managers. No one liked the status quo, but finding incremental pathways to change was challenging.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0067">In complex situations of this nature, where many things are broken but stakeholders don't agree on fixes, it can help to set out a vision for change that nearly everyone can agree on. This helps warring parties to see what element of a vision they have in common, which can lead to collaborative problem solving. <a id="R_c08-fig-0017" href="#c08-fig-0017">Exhibit 8.17</a> shows the vision for change in the Skeena watershed that was developed by a number of the groups involved.</p>
<figure> <img alt="A chart depicting the managing of a long-term strategy portfolio of Pacific salmon with setting a vision for change." src="images/c08ex017.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="794"/><figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c08-fig-0017" id="c08-fig-0017" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 8.17</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c08-para-0068">While this vision didn't lead to an immediate détente, it did help bridge the parties to an agreement to conduct an independent science review (ISRP) of conditions in the Skeena watershed. The findings of that ISRP helped generate stronger, science‐based management plans and multi‐stakeholder governance conversations that led to improvements that are ongoing.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0069"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="231" id="Page_231" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>For the Foundation team Charles worked with and its allies in the Skeena region, it was useful to visualize the map toward change as a set of strategies, some of which were competing (that is, one or the other was likely to succeed, but not both) and some of which were mutually supportive. <a id="R_c08-fig-0018" href="#c08-fig-0018">Exhibit 8.18</a> is what that picture looked like.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="232" id="Page_232" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c08-para-0070">As you can see, the map is based on a logic‐tree disaggregation of the big levers for change in the watershed, but it shows the different supporting actions and policies and institutions that were critical to drive change. With complex social problems, it is helpful to develop detailed strategic maps that help you manage problem solving on multiple levels. Game theory trees are also useful here.</p>
<p id="c08-para-0071"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="233" id="Page_233" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Uncertainty will remain one of problem solving's biggest challenges. But there is a toolkit for working through your own long time frame and complex problems: Frame the uncertainty and then iterate through the analysis to decide which actions to take to address the uncertainty. Uncertainty is about probability, subjective and objective, that brings into play how you pursue options, take fair bets, take out insurance policies and hedges and make no regrets moves.</p> </section> </section> <section>

Government practices vary widely in allowing personal assets to be held in addition to a pension.
