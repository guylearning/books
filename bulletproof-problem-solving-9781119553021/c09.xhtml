<p id="c09-para-0002">“Wicked problems” is the name given to describe a class of problems that seem to defy problem definition and solution because they are impossibly linked to complex systems.<a href="#c09-note-0001" id="R_c09-note-0001"><sup>1</sup></a> These problems typically involve multiple causes, major values disagreements <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="236" id="Page_236" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>among stakeholders, unintended consequences, or substantial behavior change in order for the problem to be solved. Terrorism, environmental degradation, and poverty are often proffered as examples of wicked problems. Wicked problems <i>are</i> different, and we won't pretend they are easy to crack. But we believe the seven‐steps approach sheds light on even these most difficult conundrums. As citizens, we have to have tools to help us understand and evaluate the solutions proposed by politicians and policy makers.</p>
<p id="c09-para-0003">In this chapter we explore the range of problems that have been termed wicked problems. These are typically at a societal or even global scale. In particular, we take on the “wickedness” involved in two case examples, obesity and overfishing of the commons.</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c09-sec-0002"></span>
<h2 id="head-2-60"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Obesity as a Wicked Problem</span></h2>
<p id="c09-para-0004">Obesity is a global phenomenon with huge economic, social, and personal costs. The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated obesity to have a similar social burden ($2 trillion) as smoking, armed violence, and terrorism. As the authors put it, “Obesity is a complex, systemic issue with no single or simple solution. The global discord surrounding how to move forward on this growing problem underscores the need for integrated assessments of potential solutions.”<a href="#c09-note-0002" id="R_c09-note-0002"><sup>2</sup></a> Obesity has dozens of contributing causes and has all the elements of a wicked problem with its complexity and interdependencies.<a href="#c09-note-0003" id="R_c09-note-0003"><sup>3</sup></a> There are genetic, environmental, behavioral, cultural, societal, and income and education dimensions involved. How then do you look to solve such a problem?</p>
<p id="c09-para-0005">The MGI report allows us to see how the McKinsey team approached the obesity problem in a way similar to the way we have outlined through the book, by defining the problem scope and constraints on solutions, disaggregating the problem along familiar demand/<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="237" id="Page_237" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>supply lines, undertaking comprehensive analysis of intervention options using a well‐known public health framework, and concluding with a synthesis and call to action. We explore these elements of problem solving in more detail to illustrate how you can make progress tackling wicked problems with the seven steps.</p> <section>
<span id="c09-sec-0003"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-32"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Problem Definition</span></h3>
<p>The MGI report sets out the dimensions of the problem as follows:</p>
<ul id="c09-list-0001">
<li id="c09-li-0001">Overweight and obese people are estimated to comprise 30% of the UK adult population, and the percentage continues to rise.</li>
<li id="c09-li-0002">The economic burden in the UK is estimated at $73 billion per annum in 2012, behind smoking at $90 billion.</li>
<li id="c09-li-0003">The direct medical costs of conditions related to being overweight or obese costs the UK Government $6 billion per annum.</li>
<li id="c09-li-0004">Healthcare costs rise with BMI levels (body mass index): Obese classes incur 58–86% higher medical costs than individuals with normal weight levels.</li></ul>
<p id="c09-para-0007">The MGI problem definition posited the UK government as the decision maker. Government agencies, clinicians, and researchers were consulted in the process. Few constraints were placed on solving the problem. Regulatory interventions, such as taxes on high‐sugar drinks and public health programs, were considered. The main requirements were for them to be judged cost effective, to have impact, and to have an evidence basis to warrant the intervention. Healthcare payers were excluded in this report because of the NHS role in the UK as a universal care provider. The MGI study in 2014 proposed a goal of a 20% share of overweight and obese individuals to be brought to normal weight category within five years, a demanding target.</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c09-sec-0004"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-33"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Cleaving the Problem</span></h3>
<p id="c09-para-0008"><a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> gave examples of a number of ways to cleave societal problems. We can cleave the problem around incidence and severity, behavioral and clinical perspectives, even financial and <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="238" id="Page_238" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>non‐financial considerations. MGI chose to cleave the problem around demand and supply, employing a cost curve, similar to the approach used for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in our earlier climate change example. The value of this cleaving perspective is that it provides a menu of opportunities in descending order of cost and size of impact.</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c09-sec-0005"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-34"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Analysis</span></h3>
<p id="c09-para-0009">The MGI team categorized interventions in 18 groups, such as high‐calorie food and drink availability, weight management programs, portion control, and public health education. In all, they looked at 74 interventions. For each intervention, they estimated cost and impact in terms of dollars per disability‐affected life years (DALY), a World Health Organization measure of disease impact. They selected 44 interventions deemed highly cost‐effective, coupled with an evidence rating, that could achieve the 20% target reduction in five years. The cost to the UK was estimated at $40 billion to implement the interventions. <a href="#c09-fig-0001" id="R_c09-fig-0001">Exhibit 9.1</a> shows the MGI cost curve.</p>
<figure><img alt="Graph depicting the cost curves for obesity interventions with the estimated average cost per DALY versus the estimated impact across full population." src="images/c09ex001.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="687"/>
<figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c09-fig-0001" id="c09-fig-0001" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 9.1</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="c09-para-0010">The cost curve shown helps policy makers in several ways, the most important being setting priorities. Typically, you will seek to implement the low‐cost, high‐impact initiatives first, particularly those considered small wins, before tackling the more divisive and costly ones. On <a href="#c09-fig-0001">Exhibit 9.1</a> those are the widest bars toward the left‐hand side. Over time, the ordering of initiatives will change on the cost curve as information is gathered on cost and impact, making it a dynamic tool for policy makers. And as we explain below on walkability, the cost‐effectiveness can change for an intervention: For example, active transport gets easier to implement if higher property values reduce the net cost of redesign of cities for walking and cycling (via property tax funding).</p>
<p id="c09-para-0011">We would like to have seen some interventions that had negative cost, meaning it pays to do them, at the bottom of the cost curve, much as we saw with the carbon‐abatement curve. The MGI analysis points to higher health costs of $750–$1,100 per annum for obese people compared to those in the normal weight range. <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="239" id="Page_239" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Where these costs are largely borne by a national health system, individual incentives are blunted in effecting savings. Nonetheless, individuals who can see a way to improve employment opportunities and extend longevity may choose to invest in weight loss and fitness programs without regulation. We return to the question of incentives shortly.</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c09-sec-0006"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-35"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Synthesis and Call to Action</span></h3>
<p id="c09-para-0012">The MGI team expressed a guiding purpose to reverse the trend of obesity and reduce its personal and societal cost. In an arena with multiple players and interests, it was incisive in proposing <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="240" id="Page_240" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>interventions that were cost effective and, for the most, part had a strong evidence base. Having explored a range of choices in terms of cost and impact, the report set out a call to action to urge decision makers to act now on the portfolio of interventions, rather than waiting for an unlikely silver bullet solution. The MGI report emphasized government interventions over other types of action given their problem cleaving. Changing human behavior is really tricky, but we see a mix of rigor and pragmatism here that is consistent with the approach we have set out in the book, one that is useful for simple and wicked problems alike.</p> <section>
<span id="c09-sec-0007"></span>
<h4 id="head-4-10"><span style="color: #d9272e;"><i>Brainstorming Further Ideas on Obesity</i></span></h4>
<p id="c09-para-0013">Throughout the book we have emphasized iterations between analysis and action. Wicked problems like obesity exemplify the need for iteration. When the next iteration of the MGI report comes along, we see an opportunity to include additional interventions, and particularly <i>behavioral interventions</i>. Here are five proposals that emerged from our brainstorming, analysis, and interviews with experts in the field. We have selected them because in problem solving we look for holistic approaches, incentives to change behavior, and high‐leverage initiatives.</p>
<p id="c09-para-0014">1. <b>Including income and education as policy variables in obesity</b>. In the United States, there is evidence reported in a recent Robert Wood Johnson Foundation analysis that adult obesity rates are “showing signs of leveling off.” This better news is tempered by findings that “obesity rates are around 30% higher among adults without a college education and with incomes below $15,000 compared with other adults.”<a href="#c09-note-0004" id="R_c09-note-0004"><sup>4</sup></a> These findings are similar to ones that came out of the US city‐based regression analysis in <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, where income and education, along with walkability and comfort, explained 82% of the differences in obesity for the population of 68 US cities. These findings argue for taking a holistic view and linking income, education, and prevention and treatment programs.</p>
<p id="c09-para-0015"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="241" id="Page_241" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>2. <b>Making more use of incentives for individual action</b>. For some time, life insurers have added loadings to policy costs related to obesity. Why wouldn't a health insurer be prepared to share savings of obesity costs with individuals? We are thinking of an incentive payment where half the savings are shared with individuals based on obesity reductions. The insurer could invite participants, who were deemed suitable for significant weight reduction, to enter an agreement with each person who brings BMI back to the acceptable range in a 12‐month period and retains it for 12 months. Bundles of incentives could be tested in focus groups before launch of an incentive program. Employers could support this idea as well: Some Japanese employers provide vouchers and subsidies for public transport use, unlike American employers that typically provide parking spaces as an employee incentive. Many employers subsidize gym membership in both countries.</p>
<p id="c09-para-0016">3. <b>Could social networks be a key to unwind obesity?</b> A large‐ scale study of obesity in the United States noted the increase in the obesity rate from 23 to 31% over a 32‐year period. Their conclusion was dramatic: “Obesity may spread in social networks in a quantifiable and discernible pattern that depends on the nature of social ties.”<a href="#c09-note-0005" id="R_c09-note-0005"><sup>5</sup></a> Their findings were that if one person became obese the likelihood of a spouse becoming obese was 37% higher, 40% for siblings, and 57% for friends. They drew on this connectedness to argue that “medical and public health interventions might be more cost effective than initially supposed, since health improvements in one might spread to others.” Could this insight lead to the great social unwinding project? And who better to involve than the UK Behavioral Insights Team, the so‐called nudge unit. Where would they start? In the same way that one person becoming obese impacted others, one person as a spouse, friend, or sibling could take the lead and be supported by committing to regaining normal weight. We now know a lot more than we did a decade ago <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="242" id="Page_242" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>about social networks; tackling obesity with this knowledge seems a sensible avenue to explore.</p>
<p id="c09-para-0017">4. <b>Supporting high‐leverage programs such as reducing weight gain in pregnancy and early childhood</b>. The ramifications of excessive weight gain in pregnancy act like a chain reaction over three decades or more. For the 40% of pregnant women in the UK who enter pregnancy overweight or obese, there is a 33% increased risk of obesity in the child at birth and at six years,<a href="#c09-note-0006" id="R_c09-note-0006"><sup>6</sup></a> 40% of overweight children continue to be overweight in adolescence, and 75–80% of obese adolescents will become obese adults.<a href="#c09-note-0007" id="R_c09-note-0007"><sup>7</sup></a> The cumulative effects over a lifetime are huge. There is research under way to explore whether interventions for expectant mothers can reduce weight gain in the gestation period (6–20 weeks). If this can be demonstrated in randomized control trials, we have another especially high‐leverage opportunity, and likely low‐cost intervention.</p>
<p id="c09-para-0018">Professor Louise Baur, a researcher who was a member of the WHO Commission on Early Childhood Obesity, cites a review of 17 studies where infants who experienced rapid weight gain from zero to two years were almost four times more likely to be overweight or obese later in life. She recommends specific strategies for providing nutrition advice to parents, promoting breastfeeding for the first 12 months, and having a monthly visit to a doctor to monitor weight gain.<a href="#c09-note-0008" id="R_c09-note-0008"><sup>8</sup></a> There may be extraordinary leverage that can come from simple, straightforward actions to address the issue of child obesity and its knock‐on effects.</p>
<p id="c09-para-0019">5. <b>Walkability or Active Transport.</b> Cities like New York or Tokyo are good examples of walkable cities. We decided to look at walkability <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="243" id="Page_243" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>in 68 US cities: it is a statistically significant variable in explaining obesity differences. The relationship is that a 10% increase in walkability reduces obesity by 0.3%. For the UK, this would have impact similar to a 10% tax on high‐sugar, high‐fat products. While it is on the margin of highly cost‐effective interventions in the MGI report, it is possible that if it included higher property tax levies it could improve benefit/cost ratios. For example, in the top 30 metro areas in the United States, “walkable urban places (walkUPs) rent at a 74% higher premium/sq. ft. over drivable suburban areas,”<a href="#c09-note-0009" id="R_c09-note-0009"><sup>9</sup></a> suggesting that future property taxes could help fund the conversion to walkable cities. This isn't an impossible goal: The average Japanese citizen walks double the distance daily of their American counterpart.</p>
<p id="c09-para-0020">Overweight and obese populations pose huge issues for policymakers around the world. While there may be multiple causes—cultural, behavioral, socio‐economic, and biological—this doesn't imply that the problem should be declared wicked and left to one side. We favor the reverse approach: setting ambitious targets and employing good problem solving approaches at the societal level with multiple intervention paths. Our look at obesity has made us more confident that we can find solutions than we were when our team first discussed this wicked problem. We don't claim the problem is solved. But this work shows a large number of promising avenues to fight obesity that have a strong evidence base, and reasonable costs relative to the economic burdens this epidemic imposes on society.</p> </section> </section> </section> <section>
<span id="c09-sec-0008"></span>
<h2 id="head-2-61"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Overfishing: The Quintessential Wicked Problem</span></h2>
<p id="c09-para-0021">Environmental degradation is one of the most pervasive wicked problems. The famous article by Garrett Hardin, “The Tragedy of the Commons,” written in 1968,<a href="#c09-note-0010" id="R_c09-note-0010"><sup>10</sup></a> influenced many to reach the <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="244" id="Page_244" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>view that so‐called common‐pool resources, such as public land, water, or fisheries, required either government intervention or private ownership to avoid overuse. Elinor Ostrom, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, showed that there are solutions available to the problems of the commons, some of which are long‐standing arrangements among resource users that have elements of community management via norms, and elements that mimic private ownership via certain kinds of harvest rights.<a href="#c09-note-0011" id="R_c09-note-0011"><sup>11</sup></a> Let's look at an example of fisheries reform that employed clever problem solving to achieve much better outcomes.</p> <section>
<span id="c09-sec-0009"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-36"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Problem Definition</span></h3>
<p id="c09-para-0022">The fishery we want to highlight is the US West Coast Groundfish fishery off the coast of California, a portion of a vast fishery extending from the coast to 200 nautical miles between the US–Canadian border and the US–Mexico border. The fishery had been in decline for some time, from a catch valued at $110 million in 1987 to a catch of only $35 million in 2003. In 2001 a Federal judge ordered the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) to examine the impact of trawl fishing, in effect sweeping the bottom of the ocean, on marine habitats. The review confirmed trawling was having a substantial negative impact on habitat and species diversity. All of the players could assume that Federal regulation was on the way after this report—even though most government interventions on gear type and fishing access have had limited success in slowing resource decline. The California coastal fishery had all the classic elements of a common‐resource problem: too much access and fishing capacity, no safe zones for fish reproduction, gear types that damaged productive seafloor habitats, declining populations of fish, and increasingly difficult economics for fishers.</p> </section> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="245" id="Page_245" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <section>
<span id="c09-sec-0010"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-37"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Conventional Solutions</span></h3>
<p id="c09-para-0023">While the problem was identified in the PFMC report, the solutions to reduce the negative effects of bottom trawling were difficult to implement. Three strategies had been adopted elsewhere with little success: trawl closure areas, trawl effort reduction via permit buybacks, and proposals to modify fishing gear to lower impact on species and by‐catch. The typical consequences or outcomes of each strategy employed in a one‐off way are shown in <a href="#c09-fig-0002" id="R_c09-fig-0002">Exhibit 9.2</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting the conventional solutions to overfishing by reducing the negative effects of bottom trawling." src="images/c09ex002.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="419"/>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="c09-para-0024">Something had to change. Conventional top‐down regulatory approaches had poor success and the economics of remaining fisheries participants were fragile and getting worse. Enter Chuck Cook and the Nature Conservancy (TNC). Chuck Cook, a veteran TNC staff member and now Senior Fisheries Advisor, was instrumental in much of the restructuring of the California fishery.<a href="#c09-note-0012" id="R_c09-note-0012"><sup>12</sup></a> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="246" id="Page_246" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>He and Charles worked together earlier on the conservation of Palmyra Atoll in the mid‐Pacific. Chuck has deep experience in working with local communities, government, and partners to find common ground and find viable solutions to sustainable‐catch issues. Chuck saw a potential solution path in applying an analogy from land‐conservation easements and market transactions in the marine environment.</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c09-sec-0011"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-38"><span style="color: #d9272e;">New Approach to Restructuring</span></h3>
<p id="c09-para-0025">A better solution emerged from TNC working closely with fishers in a process that started in 2004.<a href="#c09-note-0013" id="R_c09-note-0013"><sup>13</sup></a> When Chuck met with the owners of 22 trawl permits, he expressed TNC's interest in purchasing trawl permits on the condition that they support the establishment of a marine protected zone prohibiting bottom trawling of 3.8 million acres. The discussions progressed between fishers and TNC, and in 2006 TNC bought over 50% of the permits for $7 million, making it the second largest holder of groundfish harvest rights on the West Coast. TNC then proceeded to lease the permits back to fishermen with conservation restrictions.</p>
<p id="c09-para-0026">An additional obstacle had to be overcome to encourage fishers to use less‐damaging gear than trawling in the form of hooks and traps. In Phase 2 of this project, led by long time TNC staffer Michael Bell, TNC entered into voluntary private agreements with fishermen that specified where fishing could take place, strict limits on catch by species and by‐catch, and gear type restrictions by area. Cooperative fishing, as opposed to highly competitive fishing between individuals, became the norm in California's central coast, resulting in improving the economic and environmental performance of this fishery. In 2011 the National Marine Fisheries Service introduced a full catch share and individual transferable quota system. Catch shares allocate a total catch by species <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="247" id="Page_247" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>to each permit‐holder, with limits on both the target and by‐catch species harvested. This was the last critical element of the restructuring of the coastal groundfish fishery.</p>
<p id="c09-para-0027">This innovative conservation fishing agreement has been likened to an easement on land, conferring limited property rights in the form of permits and quotas that can be bought and sold with conditions on use. These agreements were struck between the Pacific Fishery Management Council, fishermen, and TNC. They are based on principles relating to sustainable catch, the science of fish stocks, and a collaborative approach between conservationists, scientists, fishermen, and government. They incorporate many of the ingredients cited by Elinor Ostrom in her analysis of successful arrangements for managing common‐pool resources (CPR).</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c09-sec-0012"></span>
<h3 id="head-3-39"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Morro Bay Case Study</span></h3>
<p id="c09-para-0028">In response to these changes, a community quota fund (CQF) was established in Morro Bay, one of the California regional ports, as a local non‐profit, with a board comprising the fishing community, the city of Morro Bay, scientists, and economists.<a href="#c09-note-0014" id="R_c09-note-0014"><sup>14</sup></a> TNC has sold most of its permits and harvest rights to this body and others like it along California's central coast that hold them as community assets, leased out to individual fishers. The structure is shown in <a href="#c09-fig-0003" id="R_c09-fig-0003">Exhibit 9.3</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting the structure of the ownership of community fisheries comprising of a board of community partners handling the financial and nonfinancial flows." src="images/c09ex003.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="644"/>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="c09-para-0029">The catch in Morro Bay, one of the four principal locations along California's central coast participating in the Pacific groundfish fishery, was valued at $10 million in 1995, but fell to $2 million in 2003, reflecting the loss of fish stocks. Following the new arrangements described above, the value recovered to $4 million in 2010 and $8.3 million in 2014. These improvements are partly due to recovery of fish numbers, but derive also from higher price per pound <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="248" id="Page_248" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>earned in quota fisheries, where catch volume is spread out over time and fishers can access higher value markets. <a href="#c09-fig-0004" id="R_c09-fig-0004">Exhibit 9.4</a> shows a near‐death experience for a fishery that a combination of regulation and a market solution via collective action has, so far, been able to address.</p>
<figure><img alt="Bar chart depicting the catch value of Morro Bay, the ex-vessel value in dollars spread over the years 1990 to 2014." src="images/c09ex004.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="543"/>

</figure>
<p id="c09-para-0030">According to the Morro Bay 2015 Commercial Fisheries Economic Impact Report, “Morro Bay has successfully transitioned from a larger fleet reliant on trawl and large volumes of landings to a smaller fleet profile with a wide diversity of species and gear types. This is evidenced by the growth in earnings from a 25‐year low in 2007. <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="249" id="Page_249" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>2015 is the strongest year in the last 20.”<a href="#c09-note-0015" id="R_c09-note-0015"><sup>15</sup></a> Beyond these economic measures is one of species diversity and the re‐emergence of species, such as lingcod, factors that augur well to sustain the fishery into the future. The commercial fishing industry accounts for 195 jobs for fishermen, dockworkers, and seafood processing in Morro Bay. In addition there is tourism that attracts two million visitors each year, many of which come to Morro Bay to see a working port and to purchase or be served fresh seafood.</p>
<p id="c09-para-0031">Overfishing may have been addressed at Morro Bay and other ports on the California coast, but it remains a huge issue around <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="250" id="Page_250" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>the world. The examples of common‐pool solutions and collective action provide encouragement that the problem doesn't have to be left in the too‐hard basket. An innovative debt‐for‐nature swap in the Seychelles in 2016, again led by TNC and its NatureVest unit, has seen the creation of a marine‐protected area (MPA) of 98.9 million acres, an area the size of Germany. What we see at work in California, the Seychelles, and other collective‐action settings is problem definition, problem disaggregation, and analysis that lead to new solutions that work better than conventional regulatory interventions. Externalities, one of the defining characteristics of wicked problems, can be internalized and neutralized through the innovative mechanisms developed by systematic problem solving approaches.</p> </section> </section> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-62"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p id="c09-para-0032">We have explored several wicked problems and ways to develop innovative solutions. The solutions range from relaxing assumptions for what can be part of the solution, being prepared to revise incentives to internalize externalities, to cleaving problems differently to reveal new insights into interventions. These problems are more difficult, with more causes and difficult social issues to overcome. But they are just as amenable to systematic problem solving as the simpler problems of <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p>Are there other wicked problems where there are limitations to our problem solving approach? Some of the extreme dimensions of wicked problems present particular challenges, but we don't believe that makes them outside the scope of problem solving. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul id="c09-list-0002">
<li id="c09-li-0005"><b>Where the problem changes shape as a result of an intervention</b>. Social problems, such as addressing welfare payments, are often of this nature, where the intervention may lead to dependency and undermine positive behaviors. Theories of change, such as we used in <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, are needed to map feedback loops that may be negative and seek to get incentives right.</li>
<li id="c09-li-0006"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="251" id="Page_251" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><b>Where there is no such thing as a single right answer to the problem</b>. For example, determining whether nuclear power has a role in a country's energy mix: We accept that there may not be a right answer to a problem, given sharply conflicting opinions. If that is the case, we then explore trade‐offs between reasonably right answers or in some cases least‐bad outcomes. We are comfortable addressing these issues with more sophisticated versions of Charles's preference map for deciding where to live, or using game theory to achieve minmax solutions where you minimize the maximum loss involved.</li>
<li id="c09-li-0007"><b>Where values play an important role</b>. Gun control in the US is an issue where values play an important role in shaping the debate about the issue. Sometimes these look intractable. Nonetheless, common ground is most likely to emerge from good problem solving about the sources of accidental and homicide deaths from gun ownership, and the potential for addressing some of these causes with relatively simple interventions (mental health and criminal record background checks, waiting periods, closing sales loopholes). Death‐penalty regulation may be a similar issue, where values are bridged when confronted with high error rates in death‐penalty convictions. We have found that getting groups holding different values to participate in problem disaggregation and fact gathering, can create bridges to common ground.</li>
<li id="c09-li-0008"><b>Where the real problem is nested inside other, more apparent problems</b>. An example is homelessness, now an issue in many cities around the world. Few organizations addressing homelessness see shelter as the core issue, even though it has to be addressed. In addition to providing shelter, their efforts are directed at the underlying social, financial, and mental‐health concerns and how they might be addressed. For example, a significant portion of women seeking shelter or refuge is related to domestic violence. The root cause of this mainly male behavior is complex to understand and address but is the key to long‐term solutions. We are confident that the approach and tools we set out in the obesity case to arrive at cost‐effective solutions are just as appropriate to addressing the issue of homelessness.</li></ul>
<p id="c09-para-0034"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="252" id="Page_252" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Our look at wicked problems gives us confidence that you can employ the seven‐steps process to good effect and insight on even the most challenging problems. There is no reason to put problems in the too‐hard basket. To be informed citizens and voters, we all need to be willing to put our problem solving creativity to work on these toughest societal problems.</p> </section> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-63"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Chapter 9 Takeaways</span></h2> <ul id="c09-list-0003">
<li id="c09-li-0009">Some problems are particularly difficult because they are part of complex systems, with multiple causes, many stakeholders, involve externalities, and require difficult behavioral change to affect—these have been labeled wicked problems in the policy literature over the past 40 years and include terrorism, climate change, homelessness, and obesity.</li>
<li id="c09-li-0010">While these problems <i>are</i> harder to solve, we believe the same seven‐steps framework can unlock insights into solutions.</li>
<li id="c09-li-0011">Often the leverage on these most difficult problems comes from systems rather than partial solutions, from making externalities endogenous to the problem, and from novel ways of cleaving the problem.</li> </ul> </section> <section>

<li id="c09-li-0012">List all the problems you can think of that are complex systems with many actors and multiple causes.</li>
<li id="c09-li-0013">Build a tree for understanding the causes of homelessness; take one branch and see if you can think of ways to make the externalities internal to the problem.</li>
<li id="c09-li-0014">Build a tree for drivers of terrorism in Western countries; can you think of new ways to take this problem apart that uncover novel solution paths?</li> </ul>
