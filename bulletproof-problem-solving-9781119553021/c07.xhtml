<h2 id="head-2-42"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p id="c07-para-0002">The final elements in the seven steps process, synthesizing your findings and telling a compelling story, can be the most fun. It is the culmination of all your hard work, and, with luck, answers the difficult <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="180" id="Page_180" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>question you set out to solve. Done right, your conclusions are an engaging story, supported with facts, analyses, and arguments that convince your audience of the merits of your recommended path. This can attract volunteers to your social causes, funding for your social organization or start‐up company, build harmony in your family, or boost confidence in your own career path. Good problem solving and the story telling that goes along with it make our lives better—for problem solving done well translates into action that improves our circumstances.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0003">Of course it doesn't always work out like this. Most readers will have experienced a project at work or in a volunteer organization that got through the analysis stage, and then fizzled. Failures at the later stages of problem solving have a number of causes: where giant models are not quite finished, reams of data produced without a clear point of view, conflicting interview or market survey data, or team members at odds over the right way forward. As young consultants, we dreaded the nervous presentation of detailed results that never jelled into a real story; in McKinsey this was called the <i>anxious parade of knowledge</i>, or APK.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0004">If you follow the straightforward seven‐steps process we have described, you should never succumb to deadlocked teams, confused findings, or empty APK. You will have been driving your logic trees from component disaggregation to strong and testable hypotheses, you will have followed good team processes to surface alternative hypotheses early on and avoid confirmation bias and other problem solving mistakes, and you will have practiced one‐day answers that summarize your best understanding at any point in the process, supported with synthesis of your best evidence at that juncture.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0005">This chapter addresses the transition from one‐day answers to more complete story telling. It addresses approaches to synthesis of data and analysis, using pyramid structuring of your overall case, inductive and deductive support for your argument, and compelling story telling, including to challenging audiences.</p> </section> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="181" id="Page_181" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-43"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Synthesis of Findings</span></h2>
<blockquote style="color: #d9272e;">
<p id="c07-para-0006">The quality of your synthesis will determine the quality of your decision making. This is why it pays to triangulate your views with people who you know synthesize well.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0007" class="right">—<i>Ray Dalio</i><a href="#c07-note-0001" id="R_c07-note-0001"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="c07-para-0008">The first step toward compelling story telling is to synthesize the findings from your data gathering, interviews, analysis, and modeling. If you have been following the seven‐steps approach we outlined in <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, this should be relatively straightforward. Charles learned the power of this approach on his first McKinsey project. He got on a plane to Calgary for the first meeting with the client and found himself sitting next to the senior partner on the project, who nodded a greeting and went back to his work. He was furiously scribbling on a pad of paper and ripping off the sheets. When Charles worked up the courage to ask what he was doing, his colleague answered, “I am writing the final presentation.” Final presentation? How could that be? They hadn't even met the client. He answered, “Look, I know my hypotheses are early stage and some will be wrong, but if I guess at the answers now, I'll know what questions to ask the client when we meet their team.” And he was right. Imagining a set of hypotheses allowed the team to begin focused data gathering from the first meeting.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0009">Our recommended process is iterative at each stage and driven by the interaction of the strong hypotheses of your one‐day answers with the analyses of your workplan. Alternative hypotheses should already have been tested and embraced or rejected, and dead‐end analyses pruned off. Regular team meetings (even if you have to press family and neighbors into service in makeshift teams) should have already begun to link analysis and emerging findings in a convincing way.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0010"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="182" id="Page_182" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>As you move to final synthesis, you draw together the individual findings of the work on each branch and twig of your logic tree into an overall picture. Humans are mostly visual learners, so it is often useful to represent each of your findings in the form of pictures or graphics that highlight the insights that emerged from your work. Where possible, the most powerful visualization is to show each graphic as branches on your revised tree structure. <a href="#c07-fig-0001" id="R_c07-fig-0001">Exhibit 7.1</a> is an example from the battle of the hardware company giants we introduced in <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting a tree of graphs analyzing the return on invested capital analysis of Hechinger versus Home Depot." src="images/c07ex001.jpg" class="center" width="800" height="1035"/>
<figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c07-fig-0001" id="c07-fig-0001" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 7.1</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="c07-para-0011">This kind of visualization of findings illuminates the overall problem. It allows for insights to emerge that cut across and combine the different branches of analysis. We can see the overall story begin to emerge from individual branches on revenue, costs, and asset productivity. Looking at the relative sales growth curves, we know that one business (Home Depot) far outstripped the other (Hechinger); examining the selling price data, purchasing costs, logistics expenses, overheads, store design, and inventory turns starts to paint a fuller picture of what drove the different revenue growth results. Lower prices drove higher sales growth; sales volume, along with better store design and logistics systems, allowed higher asset and inventory turnover and lower costs per unit sold in every part of the business. The synthesis in pictures in <a href="#c07-fig-0001">Exhibit 7.1</a> begins to tell a visual narrative of competing business models.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0012">We encourage you to draw pictures from the analysis that synthesize your findings. There are good primers on how to do this from the methods we learned at McKinsey such as Gene Zelazny's <i>Say It with Charts</i> to Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic's <i>Storytelling with Data</i>.<a href="#c07-note-0002" id="R_c07-note-0002"><sup>2</sup></a> As a young consultant in New York, Rob would take his pack of findings to Gene Zelazny, only to have Gene say, “Now what are you saying here Rob? These charts don't really support what you just told me you've concluded so let's ditch them. I'm really interested in that point you made about declining market share of the client <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="183" id="Page_183" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="184" id="Page_184" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>but you don't have a chart on that. Let's get that in the pack to support your findings.” This sometimes bruising process, despite Gene's positive and encouraging style, became the boot camp for consultants to learn how to synthesize findings and support them with graphics.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0013">Good team process is important here as in the other steps. We like to bring the whole team together for synthesis sessions and have each team member present their analyses and results to the assembled group. This gives another checkpoint to pressure test alternative hypotheses, and it provides the foundation for moving from the simple situation‐observation‐resolution story summary to a more complete and supported argument.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0014">This is often the stage where a big insight emerges that wasn't obvious in the branch‐level analysis. In our BHP mining example in <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> the analysis of the viability of the single mineral deposit absorbed the team right up to the point that synthesis showed the huge potential value in other nearby deposits that were unlocked by the transportation infrastructure required to develop the first mineral deposit.</p> </section> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-44"><span style="color: #d9272e;">From One‐Day Answers to Pyramid Structure</span></h2>
<p id="c07-para-0015">As we move from the early days of problem definition to work planning and completing analyses, our reasoning is sharpened. Here is a graphical way of showing this (<a href="#c07-fig-0002" id="R_c07-fig-0002">Exhibit 7.2</a>).</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting the evolution of the mode of reasoning from one-day answers to pyramid structure." src="images/c07ex002.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="382"/>
 <figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a id="c07-fig-0002" href="#R_c07-fig-0002" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 7.2</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c07-para-0016">In the early stages, our porpoising into data with well‐designed analyses is a process of <i>reasoning toward implications</i>. We hypothesize a one‐day answer using a situation‐observation‐resolution structure and we constantly pressure test this with our analyses under the structure of our workplan and team processes. As we discussed in <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, these one‐day answers are critical to the process. Summarizing the situation allows us to update our best <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="185" id="Page_185" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>understanding of the problem; observation or complication provides the tension in the problem, what isn't working, and our best insights into ways to unpick it; resolution is your best understanding of the solution path that moves us toward the answer.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0017">As the workplan is executed and our critical path analyses begin to yield fruit, our reasoning mode shifts from understanding toward marshaling <i>reasons to drive action</i>. We move from simply stating the implications of analyses toward how those results can motivate a plan for change. The seven steps approach is always oriented toward evidence‐based action—it aims to answer “What should we do and how should we do it”?</p> </section> <section>
<span id="c07-sec-0005"></span>
<h2 id="head-2-45"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Telling Compelling Stories</span></h2>
<p>Once you have synthesized your findings into a series of pressure‐tested and convincing graphics, you can move to the final step of structuring a compelling communication for your audience. <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="186" id="Page_186" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The starting point for this is to return to your problem definition worksheet and remind yourself:</p>
<ul id="c07-list-0001">
<li id="c07-li-0001">What problem are we trying to solve? How has this evolved?</li>
<li id="c07-li-0002">What are the key criteria for success that our decision maker (which may be yourself) set out in advance? It is important to reflect these explicitly in your story.</li>
<li id="c07-li-0003">Did you honor the boundaries of the problem set by the decision maker? If not—which may be for good reasons around creativity or deciding to relax a constraint to open up new possibilities—you need to make the case here.</li></ul>
<p id="c07-para-0019">The visual structure we use to represent our story structure is traditionally a pyramid—which is really just one of our logic trees turned on its side (<a href="#c07-fig-0003" id="R_c07-fig-0003">Exhibit 7.3</a>). This is the standard organizing structure taught to journalists and consultants, and was popularized in the problem solving literature by our former McKinsey colleague Barbara Minto.<a href="#c07-note-0003" id="R_c07-note-0003"><sup>3</sup></a> This visual helps show clearly how each element of our argument is supported by data, interviews, and analyses.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="187" id="Page_187" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting a basic pyramid structure representing that our story structure is traditionally a pyramid." src="images/c07ex003.jpg" class="center" width="633" height="441"/>
 <figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a id="c07-fig-0003" href="#R_c07-fig-0003" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 7.3</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c07-para-0020">At the very top level is our lead or governing statement of the problem. Not surprisingly, your latest situation–observation–resolution statement is usually the best governing statement. Depending on the audience, you can vary the order of these three statement elements. As we will show below, sometimes it is best to carefully lead the audience from situation to observation to resolution, which are your recommended actions. But our bias in most circumstances is to lead by answering the question “What Should I Do?” and then summarize the situation and key observations that support action.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0021">Using the insights from your synthesis stage, you then begin to fill in supporting arguments that back up your top‐level answer. There are a number of different ways to do this depending on the nature of your answer and your audience. <a href="#c07-fig-0004" id="R_c07-fig-0004">Exhibit 7.4</a> shows two structures that we often use.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="188" id="Page_188" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="c07-para-0022">As you have likely already recognized, our basic deductive logic (from general principles to individual cases) and inductive logic (from individual observation to general conclusions) approaches to generating answers introduced back in <a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> underpin these two structures (<a href="#c07-fig-0005" id="R_c07-fig-0005">Exhibit 7.5</a>). You can use both inductive and deductive structures in the same tree.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting two pyramid structures for the two argument types: Deductive and inductive arguments." src="images/c07ex005.jpg" class="center" width="800" height="407"/>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c07-para-0023">There is no general preference for inductive or deductive reasoning in your pyramid structure, though Minto argues that constant reference to deductive arguments can feel labored or pedantic.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0024">To complete this section, let’s look at the complete narrative of our battle of the hardware companies case in <a href="#c07-fig-0006" id="R_c07-fig-0006">Exhibit 7.6</a>. This draws together the evidence from our analysis phase into a synthesis of the findings, and then tells the story: Hechinger needed to change its business model quickly to address the competitive threat of Home Depot.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="189" id="Page_189" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="190" id="Page_190" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c07-para-0025">Here you can see the whole story on one page, with the governing thought and call to action at the top (provided by our concise situation–observation–resolution structure), the three major arguments made that underpin the governing thought, and supporting arguments and data that provide the proof for the need for action and the formula for change. The next stage from this storyline summary is to storyboard out your entire presentation. We usually divide our paper into nine boxes and cartoon or dummy each exhibit, with the storyline leads across the top of each cell. This is what Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic calls developing and checking the horizontal logic of the narrative.<a href="#c07-note-0004" id="R_c07-note-0004"><sup>4</sup></a> Humans are storytelling creatures, not logical robots. Remember that as you craft your messages.</p> <section>

<h3 id="head-3-21"><span style="color: #d9272e;">How to Deal with Difficult Audiences</span></h3>
<p id="c07-para-0026">A number of years ago Rob and Charles were working with a refinery company in a remote island location, owned by a larger company based in Australia. It was a difficult situation. The local management team resented the foreign owner meddling in their business, and they were resistant to change. The consulting team worked as best we could, employing the problem solving process we have introduced here, and came up with a final answer that looked like <a href="#c07-fig-0007" id="R_c07-fig-0007">Exhibit 7.7</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting a decision tree final storyline structure employing the problem solving process to come up with a final answer." src="images/c07ex007.jpg" class="center" width="797" height="629"/>
<figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c07-fig-0007" id="c07-fig-0007" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 7.7</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="c07-para-0027">As you can see, the recommendation was for the refinery business to cut costs substantially and become a modest growth, niche operator. While this conclusion, based on comparative analysis of competitors, was rock solid, it was not one that the local management team wanted to hear. In circumstances like this, it can make sense to use a revealed approach to your arguments, employing a decision tree structure rather than the traditional pyramid. <a href="#c07-fig-0008" id="R_c07-fig-0008">Exhibit 7.8</a> is an example of what that might look like.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration depicting an example of the decision tree argument structure using a revealed approach to various arguments." src="images/c07ex008.jpg" class="center" width="675" height="651"/>
<figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c07-fig-0008" id="c07-fig-0008" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 7.8</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="c07-para-0028">With a decision tree final storyline structure, you provide evidence for each yes/no branch in your tree, slowly working the <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="191" id="Page_191" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>decision maker toward your conclusion. You <i>reveal</i> the answer rather than leading with it. In the Oilco case the team carefully revealed compelling competitor data, layer by layer, that helped the local management team get comfortable with the difficult conclusions.</p>
<p id="c07-para-0029">In summary, the final stages of good problem solving are to synthesize the findings of your analysis in a way that highlights your insights. You are then prepared to revisit your original problem definition and answer your decision maker’s question, “What should I do?” in compelling way that motivates action. The pyramid structure helps to structure arguments and support into a powerful story.</p> </section> </section> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="192" id="Page_192" role="doc-pagebreak"></span> <section>
