<p id="c02-para-0002">Getting a crystal‐clear definition of the problem you are solving is the critical starting point to bulletproof problem solving. And it should be relatively straightforward. But a surprising number of failures in problem solving originate in poor problem definition. Teams and individuals surge off into data gathering or expert interviews <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="32" id="Page_32" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>without being very clear about the boundaries of the problem, the criteria for success, the time frame, or level of accuracy required.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0003">This is bound to lead to disappointment. A scattergun approach to data gathering and initial analysis always leads to far more effort than is necessary. And the answers often miss the mark with decision makers whose values and boundaries need to be taken explicitly into account in problem solving planning.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0004">Charles saw this kind of mistake first‐hand in the 1990s when he was running Citysearch, an Internet city guide company that sometimes collaborated with local newspapers and sometimes competed with them. Newspaper companies were the kings of local advertising then and had been for 100 years, despite the earlier advent of first radio and then television. Surely, the little Internet company entrants would be no different?</p>
<p id="c02-para-0005">Charles met with many senior leaders in the newspaper trade during those years and witnessed a kind of arrogance rooted in inaccurate problem diagnosis. These managers believed that the problem statement around new competition was: “Do the new Internet entrants have better content (news and other writing) that would win over readers?” They concluded that their newspapers had editorial content that the entrants couldn't match and therefore they didn't need to worry too much. When Charles was invited to give a keynote presentation to the 1997 Newspaper Association of America annual meeting and suggested that the competitive attack would instead come <i>from behind</i>, from erosion of near monopoly positions in classified advertising in segments like autos, real estate, employment, and personals, the room was entirely silent. This upstart was telling them about <i>their</i> market in a way that made no sense to their worldview. At the end no one clapped—it was awkward!</p>
<p id="c02-para-0006">Over the next few years it played out as predicted. New vertical players in online classified advertising sprang up and slowly cannibalized the long‐held newspaper dominance in these categories. Consumers still wanted newspaper editorial content, but they began to find their jobs, cars, homes, and dates online, stripping <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="33" id="Page_33" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>away the key source of revenue for old‐line media companies. Failure or consolidation of many great newspaper names followed. This turns out to be common in cases of disruptive technology or business model innovation. The existing players literally cannot see the threat from new entrants because their mindset, their problem boundary definition, makes them blind to it.<a href="#c02-note-0001" id="R_c02-note-0001"><sup>1</sup></a> The takeaway point here is clear: Getting problem definition right, including boundaries, is essential to good problem solving and can be an essential competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Good problem statements have a number of characteristics. They are:</p>
<ul id="c02-list-0001">
<li id="c02-li-0001">Outcomes focused: A clear statement of the problem to be solved, expressed in outcomes, not activities or intermediate outputs.</li>
<li id="c02-li-0002">Specific and measurable wherever possible.</li>
<li id="c02-li-0003">Clearly time‐bound.</li>
<li id="c02-li-0004">Designed to explicitly address decision‐maker values and boundaries, including the accuracy needed and the scale of aspirations.</li>
<li id="c02-li-0005">Structured to allow sufficient scope for creativity and unexpected results—too narrowly scoped problems can artificially constrain solutions.</li>
<li id="c02-li-0006">Solved at the highest level possible, meaning for the organization as a whole, not just optimized for a part or a partial solution.</li></ul>
<p id="c02-para-0008">Teams we worked with sometimes used a mnemonic—SMART—to remember these characteristics: whether the problem statement was specific, measurable, action oriented, relevant, and timely. SMART covers most but not all of these factors—make sure to have an outcomes focus and work at the highest level.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0009"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="34" id="Page_34" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Usually you can't fit all those characteristics into a single statement, so we like to use a problem statement worksheet that captures the whole context, as in <a href="#c02-fig-0001" id="R_c02-fig-0001">Exhibit 2.1</a>.</p>

<h3 id="head-3-1"><span style="color: #d9272e;">How a Problem Statement Is Refined: The Case of Pacific Salmon</span></h3>
<p id="c02-para-0010">Let's illustrate how this works with a specific example. Charles was asked by a newly formed charitable foundation, the Gordon &amp; Betty Moore Foundation, to look into the question of how to preserve wild Pacific salmon, a hugely important species in the north Pacific rainforest ecosystem. The iconic salmon species in the Atlantic Ocean had seen huge declines from mismanagement that caused large‐scale ecosystem harm and community economic losses, and the foundation's founder wanted to ensure that this didn't occur in the Pacific. As you can see, this is a much larger and more complicated problem than our more narrowly bounded problems of <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="35" id="Page_35" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>. But you'll see the same principles apply in solving harder problems—you just need to put a bit more work into each of the seven steps.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0011">Here is what the team knew: Pacific salmon are a critical element in northern rainforest ecosystems, sometimes called an apex species for the role they play in these systems. Nearly half a billion Pacific salmon are a substantial biomass in their own right, and have massive impact on both freshwater and marine ecosystems. They provide nutrition for many animal species, jobs for commercial fishers, food and cultural meaning for indigenous people, recreation for sport anglers, a huge boost to local economies, and are a conduit for marine nutrients to help forests thrive. It is hard to overestimate their importance in the environment, economy, culture, and food webs of this huge region. And they are in trouble, at least in many parts of their historic range, pressured by human development in land use and fisheries management approaches that affect both habitat and salmon numbers.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0012">The team wanted to help reverse these declines, but frankly weren't sure where to start. The foundation was new, but it was already committed to a long‐term model of philanthropy, whereby it would only focus on a few initiatives and would fund them for substantial periods. The founder is a world‐famous engineer, and his personal values were core in developing the foundation's four filters for the work it agreed to take on, one of which was to only work on projects with <i>measurable outcomes</i>. The other three filters were <i>importance</i> (working on things that really mattered); only working on initiatives where the foundation could make a <i>difference</i> (working on things where the foundation's unique contribution mattered); and, working on initiatives that over time would contribute to a <i>portfolio effect</i>. This means that the grants it made would invest in capabilities and outcomes that would build off and support each other. Based on this, an initial problem worksheet looked something like <a href="#c02-fig-0002" id="R_c02-fig-0002">Exhibit 2.2</a>.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="36" id="Page_36" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>
<figure><img alt="Illustration of a problem statement worksheet discussing how to substantially increase the number of Wild Pacific Salmon." src="images/c02ex002.jpg" class="center" width="674" height="732"/>
<figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c02-fig-0002" id="c02-fig-0002" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 2.2</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="c02-para-0013">The team found this sharply defined problem context extremely valuable. They knew they had up to 15 years to work on the problem and very substantial financial resources to invest if progress remained good. But the team had some real constraints it had to work within. It had to demonstrate that it was making traction on the problem quickly in frequent top‐level reviews, and it had to develop strategies that would yield <i>measurable</i> ecosystem‐level outcome improvements over time. It had to build portfolio effects of capabilities and connections that would benefit other foundation environment work. And, as the first team, it was important to <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="37" id="Page_37" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>show to the broader grant‐making and conservation communities that the focused portfolio approach to environmental grant making would really work. These are high bars, but it is really useful to know what the threshold for success is in advance.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0014">It is also critical to know what is <i>off limits</i> and to understand the implications of the boundaries to the solution set. In the salmon case, we knew that grassroots advocacy campaigns could not be a primary strategy, with a similar conclusion for large‐scale direct policy efforts, given the foundation's lower level of comfort with these approaches.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0015">Let's turn to the problem statement itself. One of the reasons the foundation selected saving Pacific salmon as one of its first granting programs was the apparent fit with the foundation's filter of measurability, a deeply held core value. After all, you can count fish, right? You can see this coming: It turns out it is a little harder than it looks.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0016">There are five different Pacific salmon species spread around the Pacific Rim from California through British Columbia, Alaska, Russia's Kamchatka and Sakhalin regions, all the way to Japan. Some species are doing well in some places, many not so well. And overall numbers go up and down each year due to a number of factors. One of the biggest of these are ocean conditions that lead to more or less of the smaller creatures that salmon eat; these follow a rough temporal pattern related to ocean temperatures called the <i>Pacific Decadal Oscillation</i>. While that sounds like a fancy bit of climatology, in fact it meant that it was very difficult to separate and account for the causes of interannual variation in salmon numbers. In short, salmon aren't easy to count, and it isn't easy to determine in strict numerical terms what the positive or negative impact is of a new policy or fisheries management program, or a new bit of protected habitat. For the team, that meant measurement would have to be over longer periods of time, making estimates of the impact of uncontrollable factors like ocean productivity.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0017">As the team understanding of the issues grew via early analysis and work with potential grantees, the problem statement evolved <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="38" id="Page_38" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>and improved. Most importantly, the team added more emphasis on maintaining salmon stock diversity and full functioning of all the elements of the ecosystem. Stock diversity means all the different ways smaller populations of the same kind of salmon use the rivers and oceans, eating different food and migrating at different times and on different routes. Diversity in the structure of the different sub‐stocks helps the overall population weather environmental shocks better, and so contributes to long‐run abundance. <a href="#c02-fig-0003" id="R_c02-fig-0003">Exhibit 2.3</a> gives <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="39" id="Page_39" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>a flavor of that evolution and an assessment of the quality of these problem statements. As you can see, one of the ways of addressing the challenges of counting salmon is to introduce the notion of sufficient populations to make use of available ocean‐carrying capacity, a measure driven by food availability and habitat. This sets a bar for healthy salmon numbers as the abundance and diversity of subspecies to utilize all of the available ocean capacity, and is a much more useful concept than plain numbers in any one year.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration of a problem statement worksheet presenting the first, second, and third cuts of the availability of healthy salmon numbers." src="images/c02ex003.jpg" class="center" width="673" height="791"/>
 <figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a href="#R_c02-fig-0003" id="c02-fig-0003" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 2.3</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c02-para-0018">Each of these problem statements reflects the foundation salmon team's greater and greater understanding of the problem as it iterated the process with salmon management agencies, tribal groups, commercial fishing organizations, sport angler groups, salmon scientists and the conservation community. Constant iteration allows the team to hone its understanding and therefore to sharpen its strategies to achieve the desired outcome—at the same time keeping all the stakeholders onside as the process runs through time.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0019">This evolution also points to a discussion within the foundation on the right level of aspiration to aim for. A narrower <i>regional</i> program focused primarily on salmon <i>management</i> might have been quicker to gain progress compared to a full north Pacific ecosystem level program, but also would have had less impact on the overall environment and human and ecosystem well‐being. A narrower framing might also have made it more difficult to generate fundamental shifts in public attitudes toward conservation, and more challenging to attract funding from other foundations. On the other hand, any of these frames still bears the risk of being overwhelmed by bigger global environmental threats, such as climate change.</p> </section> <section>

<h3 id="head-3-2"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Defining the Highest‐Level Problem: Steel Company Investments</span></h3>
<p id="c02-para-0020">The point of this is to find the right <i>scale and scope</i> in problem definition for your organization. When we worked for McKinsey, <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="40" id="Page_40" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>we often saw problems that benefited from redefinition to a higher level. For example, in one instance Rob's team was asked to review a $6 billion capital equipment investment plan for a large steel company. It looked straightforward: Evaluate the costs and benefits of each investment over time. But when they dug into the data, they discovered that the larger issue was one of an inability to generate cash because of an uncompetitive cost position, a much more pressing issue than the planned investments in new plant and machinery. The team's findings convinced the client to first address costs and attack the lack of cash generation by the business. They needed to lower overhead costs substantially and select only a fraction of the projects slated for investment to be successful. With these changes, the business was able to generate cash to survive.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0021">When possible, it is advantageous to allow flexibility in the scope or width of your problem solving project. This gives rooms for the kind of discovery described in Rob's Australian steel client. But just as important, it also provides room for creative and novel solutions. Narrowly scoped projects make for fast problem solving, but they often lead to keeping the blinders on by employing conventional conceptions of the problem space. Breakthrough ideas are unlikely to emerge with old models and framing. People often wonder at the idea that newly minted MBAs employed by consulting firms can add value to organizations with veteran management teams. The answer lies in the fresh perspectives that new eyes and new analytic approaches can bring to old problems.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0022">One of the other important principles in problem definition is to solve the problem at the <i>highest level</i> possible. The insight here is that the most granular and local solutions are often not optimal for the larger organization. In business, you often find this issue in doing capital allocation and investment decisions at the business unit level. You find what makes sense for a single unit is not what makes sense for the company overall. Wherever you can, target <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="41" id="Page_41" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>your problem solving efforts at the highest level at which you can work, rather than solving for the interests only of smaller units. In Rob's steel example the client wanted to solve for the right capital budget, but the higher‐level problem definition was their ability to generate free cash flow to convince shareholders to reinvest in the business.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0023">Similarly, Charles's salmon team learned that smaller regional approaches didn't work very well because salmon migrate through other regions and congregate in common far ocean feeding grounds. Solutions to reduce commercial fishing or choose more selective gear types in one area could be undone by increased fishing pressure in others. The north Pacific scale was the right scale to work this problem.</p> </section> <section>

<h3 id="head-3-3"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Widening the Aperture on the Problem: The Avahan HIV Project in India</span></h3>
<p id="c02-para-0024">Good problem definition or framing can have a huge positive impact as we have shown in our examples. The success of the Avahan HIV program in India was only achieved after a substantial reframing and rescoping. We describe in the sidebar below just how important improving the lens of problem definition can be—it ended up reducing HIV infections by a staggering 600,000 over a decade. The team followed the traditional public health (or supply side) approach at first, which led to some insights, but balanced it with what became a breakthrough effort on the demand or consumer side, in this case by involving sex workers in developing the solution. As a result of early testing of a hypothesis, the team was able to agree on a toolkit for replication across India, one that built in processes for community engagement and included the voices of sex workers that were often not heard. <a href="#c02-fig-0004" id="R_c02-fig-0004">Exhibit 2.4</a> shows another example of “porpoising” between the problem statement, hypotheses, and the data, to arrive at the most accurate problem statement.</p> <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="42" id="Page_42" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>

<h3 id="head-3-4"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Porpoising to Get the Problem Statement Right</span></h3>
<p>Problem statements keep on getting better when facts are brought to bear to sharpen the problem definition. We find that setting up a dialogue with questions that have to be answered is key to getting the required sharpness in problem definition. As an example, Rob <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="43" id="Page_43" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>was asked to help a team look at the issue of underinvestment in capacity building by nonprofits, a key finding of an enquiry by the Australian Government Productivity Commission. He asked the following questions:</p>
<ol class="decimal" id="c02-list-0002">
<li id="c02-li-0007">Is it true of all or some nonprofits?</li>
<li id="c02-li-0008">Is it true of large or small organizations?</li>
<li id="c02-li-0009">Is it likely due to funding available or priorities?</li>
<li id="c02-li-0010">Is it true for all nonprofit sectors or some?</li>
<li id="c02-li-0011">Is the underinvestment in operations effectiveness or managing complex systems?</li></ol>
<p id="c02-para-0026">Some of these questions could be answered with known data but others required a perspective gained from interviewing sector leaders. The team was able to conclude that the issue of underinvestment was true for most but not all nonprofits; it was particularly the case for small organizations with less than fifty employees; it was due to the fact that nonprofits had little discretionary funding for capacity building; it was more acute in sectors where the service delivery model was in question; and, finally, underinvestment was especially the case in managing complex systems, even if capacity building for operations effectiveness was also underfunded. The resulting reworded problem statement went from a very broad statement to one that targeted nonprofits that had resourcing difficulties to fund capacity building, and a specific need to update delivery models for a complex systems environment. Efforts to sharpen problem statements can pay off handsomely. In the next chapter we show the link between good problem statements and good hypotheses to test. You won't be surprised to learn that sharp problem statements lead to better and more testable hypotheses.</p> </section> </section> <section>

<h2 id="head-2-12"><span style="color: #d9272e;">Design Thinking and Seven Steps</span></h2>
<p id="c02-para-0027">One of the most common problem statements we come across relates to the <i>user experience</i>. Design thinking has developed as a powerful tool for problem solvers tackling consumer needs and <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="44" id="Page_44" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>the user experience, often in product or service design situations, but also outside those areas where creativity in problem solving is important to good outcomes. We are often asked where design thinking sits in relation to our seven‐steps analytic problem solving process. We believe it is both consistent and complementary, especially in cases where an understanding of the user experience is essential. We present cases in the book where the user experience is at the core of problem solving and lends itself to design thinking, such as our cases on where to live, HIV in India, and whether to have knee arthroscopy surgery.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0028">Design thinking is typically presented as a process, much like the seven steps, but with slightly different stages: empathize, define, ideate, build, test, and deliver. These six steps are illustrated in <a href="#c02-fig-0005" id="R_c02-fig-0005">Exhibit 2.5</a> below as an iterative and fluid process. While the methodology is laid out in what seems like a gated, sequential process, the steps are usually not linear—they can happen in parallel and steps can be iterated and repeated as insight grows.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustration of the seven-steps approach of design thinking, depicting interactions over time, including interviewing, observing, and researching." src="images/c02ex005.jpg" class="center" width="663" height="589"/>
<figcaption><p><span class="figureLabel"><a id="c02-fig-0005" href="#R_c02-fig-0005" role="doc-backlink"><b>EXHIBIT 2.5</b></a></span></p>
</figcaption></figure>
<p id="c02-para-0029">There are clear parallels between our steps and design thinking: The <i>empathize</i> and <i>define</i> steps correspond closely to the problem statement approach; the ideate step is akin to our process to break down a problem around hypotheses and then test; and the build and deliver steps correspond to our work planning and analysis steps. As in our approach, design thinking is highly iterative, revisiting earlier stages as knowledge accumulates.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0030">By formalizing the methodology and values of designers, design thinking allows teams to use the creative problem solving process to find innovative solutions. A <i>user‐centered approach</i> is fundamental to this kind of problem solving, where a significant amount of time is spent empathizing with and understanding the user and their “pain points.” This is done through patient, sustained interactions over time, including interviewing, observing, and researching. We like the idea of integrating design thinking into the seven‐steps approach, especially when novel and creative ideas are critical to the solution.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0031"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="45" id="Page_45" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Design thinking usually starts with understanding the potential user's needs. Thus, the first step of the design thinking methodology is empathizing with the people you want to serve, learning what their needs are, recognizing why the product or solution could be relevant, and how it will be used within their everyday life. The cycle to empathize and then build‐test‐redefine, and build‐test‐redefine again, is based on an idea that you don't have to make decisions based on historical data and instinct. Rather, decisions can evolve, based on evidence from users' reactions to successful or failed prototypes. Design thinking methodology that focuses on user understanding, research, and iterating with prototypes, is a powerful tool to use in conjunction with the seven‐steps problem solving approach, especially in the consumer/product space.</p>
<p id="c02-para-0032"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="46" id="Page_46" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Putting effort into problem definition pays off. It gives you a smart start and an efficient process. Iterative re‐cuts of the problem definition are highly valuable. And finding ways to challenge problem framing and scope will give you greater creativity in your solutions.</p> </section> <section>
