<p class="C2056"><strong>Financial Transparency: Our Ultimate Goal</strong></p>
<p class="P68">Financial training is valuable, both to the people who receive it and to the company that sponsors it. But these days, even that may not go far enough.</p>
<p class="P41">The reason? People may not have learned a lot about finance in recent years, but they have certainly learned that they can’t take their employer’s financial stability for granted. Too many large companies have gone out of business or have been snapped up by an acquirer at bargain prices (usually with a huge loss of jobs). Too many companies have been shown to be cooking the books, typically with devastating consequences for the people who worked there. People all over the country have learned the lesson: for very practical reasons, they should understand something about the finances of the company they work for. Like investors, they need to know how it’s doing.</p>
<p class="P41">So think what could be gained by a true culture of financial transparency and intelligence—a culture in which people everywhere actually saw and learned to understand the financial statements. No, we don’t expect everyone to become Wall Street analysts or accountants. We just think that if the financials are out there and the key concepts repeatedly explained, every employee in the place will be more trusting and more loyal, and the company will be stronger for it. To be sure, publicly traded companies can’t <span id="page_258">show </span>consolidated financials to employees except once a quarter, when the information is released to the public. But they can certainly make a point of explaining those financials when they are released. In the meantime, they can make sure that employees see operating numbers for the department or facility they work in.</p>
<p class="P41">You can see that we believe passionately in the power of knowledge—and when it comes to business, we believe most of all in the power of financial knowledge and the financial intelligence necessary to put it to work. Financial information is the nervous system of any business. It contains the data that show how the business is faring—where its strengths are, where its weaknesses are, where its opportunities and threats are as well. For too long, a relative handful of people in each company are the only ones who have understood what the financial data was telling them. We think more people should understand it—starting with managers but ultimately extending out into the entire workforce. People will be better off for gaining that understanding, and so will companies.</p>
