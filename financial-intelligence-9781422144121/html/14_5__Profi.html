<p class="C2056"><strong>Profit Is an Estimate</strong></p>
<p class="P68">In a familiar phrase generally attributed to Peter Drucker, profit is the sovereign criterion of the enterprise. The use of the word <em>sovereign </em>is right on the money. A profitable company charts its own course. Its managers can run it the way they wish to. When a company stops being profitable, other people begin to poke their noses into the business. Profitability is also how you as a manager are likely to be judged. Are you contributing to the company’s profitability or detracting from it? Are you figuring out ways to increase profitability every day, or are you just doing your job and hoping everything will work out?</p>
<p class="P41">Another familiar saying, this one variously attributed to Laurence J. Peter of <em>The Peter Principle </em>and to Yogi Berra, tells us that if we don’t know where we’re going we’ll probably wind up somewhere else. If you don’t know <em>how </em>to contribute to profitability, you’re unlikely to do so effectively.</p>
<p class="P41">In fact, too many people in business don’t understand what profit really <em>is</em>, let alone how it is calculated. Nor do they understand that a company’s profit in any given period reflects a whole host of estimates and assumptions. The art of finance might just as easily be termed the art of making a profit—or, in some cases, the art of making profits look better than they really are. We’ll see in this part of the book how companies can do this, both legally and illegally. Most companies play it pretty straight, though there are always a few that end up pushing the limits.</p>
<p class="P41"><span id="page_44">We’ll </span>focus on the basics of understanding an income statement, because “profit” is no more and no less than what shows up there. Learn to decipher this document, and you will be able to understand and evaluate your company’s profitability. Learn to manage the lines on the income statement that you can affect, and you will know how to contribute to that profitability. Learn the art involved in determining profit, and you will definitely increase your financial intelligence. You might even get where you are going.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>A (VERY) LITTLE ACCOUNTING</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">We promised in the previous chapter to include only a smattering of accounting procedures in this book. There is one accounting idea, however, that we will explain in this chapter, because once you understand it, you will grasp exactly what the income statement is and what it is trying to tell you. First, though, we want to back up one step and make sure there isn’t a major misconception lurking in your mind.</p>
<p class="P41">You know that the income statement is supposed to show a company’s profit for a given period—usually a month, a quarter, or a year. It’s only a short leap of imagination to conclude that the income statement shows how much cash the company took in during that period, how much it spent, and how much was left over. That “left over” amount would then be the company’s profit, right?</p>
<p class="P41">Alas, no. Except for some very small businesses that do their accounting this way—it’s called <em>cash-based accounting</em>—that notion of an income statement and profit is based on a fundamental misconception. In fact, an income statement measures something quite different from cash in the door, cash out the door, and cash left over. It measures <em>sales </em>or <em>revenues, costs </em>or <em>expenses</em>, and <em>profit </em>or <em>income</em>.</p>
<p class="P41">Any income statement begins with sales. When a business delivers a product or a service to a customer, accountants say it has made a sale. Never mind if the customer hasn’t paid for the product or service yet—the business may count the amount of the sale on the top line of its income statement for the period in question. No money at all may have changed hands. Of course, for cash-based businesses such as retailers and restaurants, sales and cash coming in are pretty much the same. But most businesses have to <span id="page_45">wait </span>thirty days or more to collect on their sales, and manufacturers of big products such as airplanes may have to wait many months. (You can see that managing a company such as Boeing would entail having a lot of cash on hand to cover payroll and operating costs until the company is paid for its work. We’ll get to a concept known as working capital, which helps you assess such matters, in <a href="46_PART_SEV.html#page_223">part 7 </a>of the book.)</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>The Matching Principle</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">The matching principle is a fundamental accounting rule for preparing an income statement. It simply states, “Match the cost with its associated revenue to determine profits in a given period of time—usually a month, quarter, or year.” In other words, one of the accountants’ primary jobs is to figure out and properly record all the costs incurred in generating sales.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">And the “cost” lines of the income statement? Well, the costs and expenses a company reports are not necessarily the ones it wrote checks for during that period. The <em>costs and expenses on the income statement are those it incurred in generating the sales recorded during that time period</em>. Accountants call this the <em>matching principle</em>—all costs should be <em>matched </em>to the associated revenue for the period represented in the income statement—and it’s the key to understanding how profit is determined.</p>
<p class="C1974">The matching principle is the little bit of accounting you need to learn. For example:</p>
<p class="C1980">• If an ink-and-toner supplier buys a truckload of cartridges in June to resell to customers over the next several months, it does <em>not </em>record the cost of all those cartridges in June. Rather, it records the cost of each cartridge when the cartridge is sold. The reason is the matching principle.</p>
<p class="C1980">• And if a delivery company buys a truck in January that it plans to use over the next three years, the cost of the truck doesn’t show up on the income statement for January. Rather, the truck is depreciated over the whole three years, with one-thirty-sixth of the truck’s cost appearing as an expense on the income statement each month (assuming <span id="page_46">simple </span>straight-line methods of depreciation). Why? The matching principle. The truck is one of the many costs associated with the work performed during each of the thirty-six months—the work that shows up in that month’s income statement.</p>
<p class="C1980">• The matching principle even extends to items like taxes. A company may pay its tax bill once a quarter—but every month the accountants will tuck into the income statement a figure reflecting the taxes owed on that month’s profits.</p>
<p class="C1981">• The matching principle applies to service companies as well as product companies. A consulting firm, for example, sells billable hours, meaning the time each consultant is working with a client. Accountants still need to match all the expenses associated with the time—marketing costs, materials costs, research costs, and so on—to the associated revenue.</p>
<p class="C2051">You can see how far we are from cash in and cash out. Tracking the flow of cash in and out the door is the job of another financial document, namely the cash flow statement (<a href="27_PART_FOU.html#page_123">part 4</a>). You can also see how far we are from simple objective reality. Accountants can’t just tote up the flow of dollars; they have to <em>decide </em>which costs are associated with the sales. They have to make assumptions and come up with estimates. In the process, they may introduce bias into the numbers.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>THE PURPOSE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">In principle, the income statement tries to measure whether the products or services that a company provides are profitable when everything is added up. It’s the accountants’ best effort to show the sales the company generated during a given time period, the costs incurred in making those sales (including the costs of operating the business for that span of time), and the profit, if any, that is left over. Possible bias aside, this is a critically important endeavor for nearly every manager in a business. A sales manager needs to know what kind of profits she and her team are generating so that she can make decisions about discounts, terms, which customers to pursue, and so on. A marketing manager needs to know which products <span id="page_47">are </span>most profitable so that those can be emphasized in any marketing campaigns. A human resources manager should know the profitability of products so that he knows where the company’s strategic priorities are likely to lie when he is recruiting new people.</p>
<p class="P41">Over time, the income statement and the cash flow statement in a well-run company will track one another. <em>Profit </em>will be turned into <em>cash</em>. As we saw in <a href="10_3__Why_I.html#page_17">chapter 3</a>, however, just because a company is making a profit in any given time period doesn’t mean it will have the cash to pay its bills. Profit is always an estimate—and you can’t spend estimates.</p>
<p class="P41">With that lesson under our belts, let’s turn to the business of decoding the income statement.</p>
