<p class="C2056"><strong>The Rules Accountants Follow—and Why You Don’t Always Have To</strong></p>
<p class="P68">We don’t plan to include more than a smattering of accounting procedures in this book. But we do think it’s a good idea to have a broad grasp of the rules accountants are supposed to follow. That will help you understand why they choose to rely on certain estimates and assumptions and not others. Besides, some companies prepare financials for their own use that do <em>not </em>follow these rules—and those documents can be valuable, too.</p>
<p class="P41">So let’s begin at the beginning. Accountants in the United States rely on a set of guidelines known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP (pronounced <em>gap</em>) for short. GAAP includes all the rules, standards, and procedures that companies use when preparing their financial statements. GAAP rules are established and administered by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB (pronounced <em>fasby</em>) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA, pronounced <em>A-I-C-P-A</em>). The Securities and Exchange Commission requires publicly traded companies to adhere to GAAP standards. Most privately held companies, nonprofits, and governments also use GAAP. Strictly speaking, we should use <span id="page_27">the </span>phrase US GAAP, because these rules apply only to American companies. (We’ll have more to say in a moment on international standards.)</p>
<p class="P41">If you were to lay out all the GAAP pronouncements on paper, page by page, some people estimate they would run to more than 100,000 pages. Accountants who use GAAP to prepare financial statements typically are experts in one area of the rules, such as depreciation. We haven’t yet met anyone who has read and is an expert on the entire code.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>RULES THAT AREN’T REALLY RULES</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">The purpose of GAAP is to make financial information useful to investors, creditors, and others who make decisions based on a company’s financial reporting. GAAP reporting is also supposed to provide helpful information to company executives and managers—information that will lead to improving the business’s performance and will be useful in maintaining company records.</p>
<p class="P41">But GAAP rules are not what most people might think of as “rules.” They don’t take the form of imperatives, such as “Count this expense exactly this way” or “Count this revenue exactly that way.” They are guidelines and principles, and so are open to interpretation and judgment calls. A company’s accountants must figure out how a given principle applies to their business. This is a big part of the art of finance. Remember, the accountants and finance professionals are attempting to create a picture of reality through the numbers. It will never be exact or perfect, but it does need to be tailored to their own individual situation. GAAP allows that.</p>
<p class="C1974">If you look at the footnotes of public company’s financials, you’ll often see that some of the notes explain how the company’s accountants interpreted GAAP guidelines. For example, one of the footnotes on Ford’s 2010 financials reads as follows:</p>
<p class="C2115"><em>We are required by US GAAP to aggregate the assets and liabilities of all held-for-sale disposal groups on the balance sheet for the period in which the disposal group is held for sale. To provide comparative balance sheets, we also aggregate the assets and liabilities for significant held-for-sale disposal groups on the prior-period balance sheet.</em></p>
<p class="C2051"><span id="page_28">Wow. </span>How’s that for financial jargon? But at least the accountants are explaining their GAAP-related practices in terms other financial professionals can understand.</p>
<p class="C1974">Sometimes it happens that the accountants have to restate their financials. Maybe they identified new information, or perhaps they discovered an error. Maybe the GAAP rules changed. Apple, for example, restated its 2009 results, as announced in a press release on January 5, 2010:</p>
<p class="C2181"><em><strong>*Retrospective Adoption of Amended Accounting Standards</strong></em></p>
<p class="C2115"><em>The new accounting principles result in the Company’s recognition of substantially all of the revenue and product cost for iPhone and Apple TV when those products are delivered to customers. Under historical accounting principles, the Company was required to account for sales of both iPhone and Apple TV using subscription accounting because the Company indicated it might from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. Under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales for iPhone and Apple TV were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each product’s estimated economic life. This resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue and cost of sales related to iPhone and Apple TV.</em></p>
<p class="C2183"><em>Because Apple began selling both iPhone and Apple TV in fiscal 2007, the Company retrospectively adopted the new accounting principles as if the new accounting principles had been applied in all prior periods</em> . . .</p>
<p class="C2051">Again, this is more than any nonfinancial person probably wants to know. But if you’re an investor trying to assess Apple’s performance from year to year, you need to understand exactly why and how the company restated its financials. Otherwise you’re comparing pears to peaches.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>WHY GAAP MATTERS</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">A common set of accounting rules provides several benefits. It gives investors and others a reliable way to compare financial results between companies, between industries, and from one year to another. If every company <span id="page_29">assembled </span>its financials differently, using whatever rules it felt were appropriate, the results would be like the United Nations without translators. Nobody could understand anybody else, and nobody could compare Ford with GM or Microsoft with Apple. You wouldn’t know, for example, if the companies counted sales and costs the same way, and you could never really know which was more profitable.</p>
<p class="C1974">GAAP also attempts to ensure that everything is on the up-and-up. To be sure, people are always figuring out ways to get around the rules. And Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, is famous for the warnings he has issued, such as this classic one from his 1988 letter to his shareholders:</p>
<p class="C2115"><em>There are managers who actively use GAAP to deceive and defraud. They know that many investors and creditors accept GAAP results as gospel. So these charlatans interpret the rules “imaginatively” and record business transactions in ways that technically comply with GAAP but actually display an economic illusion to the world. As long as investors—including supposedly sophisticated institutions—place fancy valuations on reported “earnings” that march steadily upward, you can be sure that some managers and promoters will exploit GAAP to produce such numbers, no matter what the truth may be. Over the years, [my partner] Charlie Munger and I have observed many accounting-based frauds of staggering size. Few of the perpetrators have been punished; many have not even been [c]ensured. It has been far safer to steal large sums with a pen than small sums with a gun.</em></p>
<p class="C2051">Despite such malfeasance, GAAP provides a touchstone, a body of guidelines that most companies, if not all, follow closely. FASB and the AICPA continually revise and update the rules to reflect new issues and concerns, so GAAP is a living entity that evolves with the times.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>THE KEY PRINCIPLES</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">There are several principles that form the foundation of GAAP and GAAP-based financial statements. Knowing these principles will help you understand what can and cannot be found in the financials.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong><span id="page_30">Monetary </span>Units and Historical Cost</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">This principle states that all items in financial statements are expressed in monetary units, such as dollars, euros, or whatever. It also says that the price a company paid for an asset, which accountants call <em>historical cost</em>, is the basis for determining its value. (Assets are what a company owns.) We’re getting into some art-of-finance issues here. For example, a building may be worth far more today than when it was built, yet its valuation on the books will be what it originally cost the company. However, companies do not typically value financial assets such as stocks and bonds at historical cost. The accountants are required to value financial assets at their current market value. This is known as <em>mark-to-market accounting</em>, and we discuss it in the <a href="26_Part_Thr.html#page_119">toolbox</a> following part 3.</p>
<p class="P41">You can see why the footnotes to the financial statements often come in handy. The footnotes tell you how assets are valued, and you may be able to see whether the company’s assets might be worth more or less than indicated on the financials.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Conservatism</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">GAAP requires accountants to be <em>conservative</em>. No, we don’t mean in their politics or their lifestyle, only in their accounting—although maybe that explains why the stereotypical accountant <em>is </em>conservative in other areas of life. Conservatism in accounting means, for example, that when a company expects a loss, the loss must show up in the financial statements as soon as it can be quantified—that is, as soon as the amounts involved are known. Accountants call this <em>recognizing </em>a loss.</p>
<p class="C1974">It’s the opposite with gains. When a company expects a gain, the accountants can’t record it until they know for sure that the gain actually happened. Let’s imagine, for instance, that a company makes a sale. Can the accountants put it in the books? Only, says GAAP, if they are satisfied that at least four conditions hold:</p>
<p class="C1980">• <em>There is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists</em>. This just means the company is confident that a sale really did happen.</p>
<p class="C1980">• <em>Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered</em>. What was sold is somehow delivered to the customer.</p>
<p class="C1980"><span id="page_31">• </span><em>The seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable</em>. The price must be known.</p>
<p class="C1981">• <em>Collectability is reasonably assured</em>. You can’t count it as a sale if you don’t think you can collect.</p>
<p class="C2051">In most cases, of course, all these conditions are easily met. Accountants have to make judgment calls only on the margins.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">GAAP offers guidelines rather than rules, so companies can make choices about the accounting methods and assumptions they use. Once a company selects a particular method or assumption, however, it should continue to use that method or assumption unless something in the business warrants a change. In other words, you can’t alter your methods or assumptions every year without good reason. If the accountants decided on different assumptions every year, nobody could compare results year to year, and you as a manager wouldn’t know what the numbers were really telling you. Then, too, companies might change methods and assumptions just to make the numbers look better each year.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Full Disclosure</strong></p>
<p class="C2118">Full disclosure relates to the previous guideline, consistency. If a company changes an accounting method or assumption and the change has a material impact (more on “material” in a minute), then it must disclose both the change and the financial effects of that change. You can see the logic. Those of us reading the reports need to know about changes and their impact to fully understand what the numbers mean. Companies take this requirement seriously. In the example below, Ford disclosed a change in its 2010 financials even though it did <em>not </em>have a material impact—an appropriately conservative approach.</p>
<p class="C2115">Transfers of Financial Assets. <em>During the first quarter of 2010, we adopted the new accounting standard related to transfers of financial assets. The standard requires greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a company’s continuing involvement in the transferred financial assets. The standard also removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose <span id="page_32">entity </span>from US GAAP and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets. The new accounting standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or financial statement disclosures.</em></p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Materiality</strong></p>
<p class="C2118"><em>Material </em>in accountant-speak means something significant—something that would affect the judgment of an informed investor about the company’s financial situation. Every material event or piece of information must be disclosed, typically in the footnotes of financial statements. For example, Apple’s financials for fiscal year 2011 include the following caveat:</p>
<p class="C2115"><em>As of September 24, 2011, the end of the annual period covered by this report, the Company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below, as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.</em></p>
<p class="C2051">In other words, we don’t expect any losses from lawsuits, but we might be wrong.</p>
<p class="P41">These five principles aren’t the only ones in GAAP, but in our view they are among the most important.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">The rest of the world—more than one hundred countries—uses standards that are different from GAAP. They are called International Financial Reporting <span id="page_33"></span>Standards, or IFRS. Like GAAP, IFRS lays down guidelines and rules that organizations follow when putting together their financial statements. The goal of IFRS is to make company comparisons from one country to another as easy as possible. The IFRS rules are generally somewhat simpler than GAAP’s.</p>
<p class="P41">And as this book goes to press—guess what?—the United States may join IFRS. The AICPA has recommended that it do so, and the SEC is promising a decision soon. However, it is likely to be several years before US companies are required to abide by IFRS rules. Meanwhile, companies themselves disagree about the proposed changeover. For instance, in July 2011, a <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article reported a clash between big and small companies. Larger companies, which often do business internationally, generally want the IFRS implementation; smaller companies, often with no business outside of the United States, don’t see any value.<sup><a id="id_102" href="57_Notes.html#id_285">1 </a></sup>From our perspective, moving to IFRS would mean that every financial statement used the same language, something we always think is a good thing.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>NON-GAAP REPORTING</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Remember we said at the beginning of this chapter that some companies prepare not only their regular GAAP financials but another set of statements that do not follow GAAP rules? Well, it’s true. Many companies report numbers that do not fall under the rules and guidelines of GAAP. These are called—hold your breath—non-GAAP numbers. Companies often use them for internal management purposes.</p>
<p class="P41">Does this mean that the companies are keeping the proverbial two sets of books? Not really. They use non-GAAP numbers to understand their business, without worrying about matters such as onetime events or changes in GAAP guidelines that are irrelevant to running the company. Many companies even report non-GAAP numbers (along with their GAAP numbers) to Wall Street analysts and the public. They may believe that the non-GAAP numbers more accurately portray the company’s performance, or that certain non-GAAP numbers are important measures of performance. Or they may just want to present the company’s financial situation without certain numbers that are irrelevant to the long-term prospects of the business. In general, they present the non-GAAP results because they <span id="page_34">believe </span>those numbers enhance outsiders’ understanding of the company’s performance and facilitate year-to-year comparisons.</p>
<p class="C1974">Here, for example, is what Starbucks had to say in its press release announcing its results for the third quarter of 2011:</p>
<p class="C1980">• Consolidated operating margin was 13.7%, up 120 basis points over prior-year period’s GAAP results and 40 basis points over prior-year period’s non-GAAP results.</p>
<p class="C1980">• US operating margin improved 300 basis points to 18.8% on a GAAP basis and 210 basis points over the prior-year period’s non-GAAP results.</p>
<p class="C1981">• International operating margin improved 200 basis points to 12.2% on a GAAP basis and 140 basis points over the prior-year period’s non-GAAP results.</p>
<p class="C2051">A “basis point,” incidentally, is one one-hundredth of a percentage point. So 100 basis points equals 1 percent. As for operating margin, you’ll learn about it later in <a href="36_21__Prof.html#page_164">chapter 21</a>; for now, understand that it is a measure of profit. So Starbucks is reporting profit in both GAAP and non-GAAP terms.</p>
<p class="C1974">Later in the press release, Starbucks explains how it calculated its non-GAAP numbers:</p>
<p class="C2115"><em>The non-GAAP financial measures provided in this release exclude 2010 restructuring charges, primarily related to previously announced company-operated store closures. The company’s management believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures better enables investors to understand and evaluate the company’s historical and prospective operating performance. More specifically, for historical non-GAAP financial measures, management excludes restructuring charges because it believes that these costs do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company’s future operating performance or comparisons to the company’s past operating performance.</em></p>
<p class="C2051">Ironically, GAAP rules have a requirement that governs the reporting of non-GAAP numbers. Companies usually show how they got, mathematically, <span id="page_35"></span>from the GAAP number to the non-GAAP number. This is often called a bridge statement. We aren’t going to get into that here—too many details!—but feel free to look into companies’ financial statement notes or supplemental documents if you’re interested.</p>
<p class="P41">OK, enough on GAAP. Now let’s plunge into the nitty-gritty of financial intelligence, beginning with the three financial statements.</p>
