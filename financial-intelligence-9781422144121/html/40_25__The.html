<p class="C2056"><strong>The Investor’s Perspective</strong></p>
<p class="C2264"><strong>The “Big Five” Numbers and Shareholder Value</strong></p>
<p class="P68">As we’ve mentioned before, we wrote this book for people who work in organizations, not for investors. But the investor’s perspective always informs managerial decisions, because every company must do its best to keep shareholders and bondholders happy. Even the owners and employees of privately held companies can benefit from understanding this perspective, since it provides some good indicators of the financial health of their company. So this chapter addresses the question: which ratios and other indicators does the typical investor or bondholder care most about?</p>
<p class="P41">In our view, Wall Street and other outside investors are really looking at five key metrics when they assess a company’s financial performance or its attractiveness as an investment. You can think of these measures as the Big Five. When all five are moving in the right direction, it’s a safe bet that investors will favor the company’s prospects.</p>
<p class="C1974">The Big Five are:</p>
<p class="C1980">• Revenue growth from one year to the next</p>
<p class="C1980">• Earnings per share (EPS)</p>
<p class="C1980">• Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)</p>
<p class="C1980"><span id="page_186">• </span>Free cash flow (FCF)</p>
<p class="C1981">• Return on total capital (ROTC) or return on equity (ROE). ROE is the right metric for financial businesses such as banks and insurance companies.</p>
<p class="C2051">Let’s briefly look at each one.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>REVENUE GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Not every company grows. Most small businesses reach a certain size and stay there because the opportunities for growth are limited. Some privately held companies have terrific growth prospects, but the owners decide that they prefer to keep the business relatively small. (A great book called <em>Small Giants</em>, by Bo Burlingham, tells the story of many such companies.<sup><a id="id_216" href="57_Notes.html#id_291">1</a></sup>) But when a business “goes public”—sells stock to outside investors—it has no choice about whether to pursue growth. Investors won’t buy the stock unless they expect the value of their investment to increase over time. They want to see a growing dividend, an appreciating stock price, or both. To provide either one, the company must expand its business.</p>
<p class="P41">How much growth is reasonable? It depends on the company, the industry, and the economic situation. Some high-tech companies—Google is an example—go through periods of explosive growth. Most growth-oriented companies expand far more slowly; a growth rate of 10 percent a year, sustained over time, is remarkably good. (According to research by Bain &amp; Company, only about 10 percent of global companies sustain an annual growth rate in revenue and earnings of at least 5.5 percent over ten years while also earning their cost of capital.<sup><a id="id_217" href="57_Notes.html#id_292">2</a></sup>) Some large companies peg their goals to the growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in the countries where they operate. General Electric, for instance, typically plans to expand its business by two or three times the rate of GDP growth. If GDP is increasing at 1 percent and GE grows at 2 or 3 percent, the company can declare victory.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong><span id="page_187">EARNINGS </span>PER SHARE</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">EPS is often the first number companies report to investors in their quarterly earnings calls. It is simply the company’s net income for the quarter or year divided by the average number of shares outstanding during the period.</p>
<p class="P41">Investors expect increases in EPS over time, just as they do with revenue. Other things being equal, a growing EPS presages an increasing stock price. During an economic slowdown, revenues might fall, but most companies try hard to keep EPS up by reducing costs. Shareholders can accept revenue declines during a slump, but they don’t like to see a drop in EPS.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">We’ve already mentioned EBITDA a few times in this book. It’s an important measure because investors and bankers view it as a good indicator of future operating cash flow. Lenders like it because it can help them assess a company’s ability to repay its loans. Shareholders like it because it is a measure of cash earnings before the accountants have added in noncash expenses such as depreciation. EBITDA can be manipulated by accounting tricks, as we noted earlier, but it isn’t as easily manipulated as net profit. A strong, healthy company should experience growth in EBITDA over time.</p>
<p class="P41">Incidentally, EBITDA is often used in valuing businesses. Many companies are bought and sold at a price that is an agreed-upon multiple of EBITDA.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>FREE CASH FLOW</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">We discussed free cash flow in the <a href="33_Part_Fou.html#page_152">toolbox</a> for part 4. It’s a key part of any investor’s measurement kit. If a company’s free cash flow is healthy and growing, investors can be pretty sure that it is doing well and that its stock price will rise over time. Moreover, a company with a healthy free cash flow can finance its own growth even when investment or debt capital is hard to come by.</p>
<p class="P41"><span id="page_188">Here’s </span>one more wrinkle on these two indicators: many investors are now looking at free cash flow <em>divided </em>by EBITDA. When that ratio is low, it may indicate that the company is trying to make its EBITDA look strong through accounting gimmickry even though its cash flow is relatively weak. Some people call this ratio the <em>cash conversion metric</em>. Another formula that’s sometimes used is operating cash flow divided by EBIT (rather than by EBITDA). Either way, the metric shows how well the company is converting profit to cash.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>RETURN ON TOTAL CAPITAL OR RETURN ON EQUITY</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">ROTC, discussed in <a href="37_22__Leve.html#page_172">chapter 21</a>, tells investors whether the business is generating a return high enough to justify their investment. ROE is most commonly used in evaluating financial businesses. A bank, for instance, makes money by borrowing money in the form of deposits and then lending those deposits out. ROTC isn’t a good indicator of its performance because a bank’s debt to its depositors is part of its business, not part of its capital. ROE is a far better gauge of performance.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>MARKET CAP, PRICE-TO-EARNINGS, AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Along with the Big Five, investors also examine many other ratios and indicators. Three of the most common are market capitalization, the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), and what is often called <em>shareholder value</em>.</p>
<p class="P41">A company’s <em>market cap </em>is simply the current stock price of a company multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. It represents the total value of the business on any given day. If a company has 10 million shares outstanding and its market price on Tuesday is $20, its market cap that day is $200 million. Many large companies have market caps well over $100 billion. At the end of 2011, Apple’s was about $375 billion, IBM’s close to $220 billion.</p>
<p class="P41">While the market cap shows what a company is worth to investors, the book value of the company is simply the value of the equity of the business as shown on the balance sheet. Most companies’ market caps are significantly higher than their book values. Some investors—Warren Buffett, for example—like to look at the “market to book” ratio. Buffett often tries to <span id="page_189">fi</span>nd companies that are trading at a market cap close to or even below their book value.</p>
<p class="P41">The <em>price-to-earnings ratio </em>or P/E is the current stock price divided by the prior year’s earning per share. Historically, most businesses have traded in public markets at P/E ratios of roughly 16 to 18. Companies with higher ratios are considered to have high growth potential; those with lower ratios are considered slow-growth businesses. Investors often try to find companies with P/E ratios lower than the investor believes appropriate. At the end of 2011 both Apple and IBM had a P/E of about 14.6.</p>
<p class="P41">In a sense, all these measures are indicators of a company’s shareholder value. But the term “shareholder value” crops up in a number of different contexts and has a variety of meanings. Sometimes it just means market cap; sometimes it refers to the expected future cash flows of a company (which, after all, is what investors are buying when they purchase a share of stock); sometimes it refers to the increase in dividends, share price, or both that investors hope to realize over time. A CEO might write in his annual letter, “Our goal is to increase shareholder value.” It hardly matters what definition he is using, because increases in any one of them would redound to investors’ advantage.</p>
<p class="P41">Increasing shareholder value is important to everyone who works for a company, not just to shareholders. A higher shareholder value compared with the past or compared with competitors bespeaks relative financial strength. Lenders like to lend to strong companies. Investors like to invest in them. Strong companies are more likely than weaker ones to survive tough economic times and to prosper in good ones. They are more likely to offer their employees job security and opportunities for advancement, to say nothing of steady paychecks and annual raises. Customers like strong companies as well. Strong companies have more pricing flexibility than weak ones, and they are likely to be around next month and next year.</p>
<p class="P41">What determines shareholder value? It isn’t just current financial performance. A well-regarded biotech company, for instance, may have a high market cap even though it has no earnings, just because investors expect it to create a lot of value in the future through the products it brings to market. Conversely, a solidly profitable company with poor growth prospects may be worth considerably less than a company with lower current profits and better hopes for the future.</p>
<p class="C1974"><span id="page_190">In </span>general, shareholder value depends on market perceptions, which in turn are driven by:</p>
<p class="C1980">• The company’s current financial performance</p>
<p class="C1980">• The company’s prospects for growth in the future</p>
<p class="C1980">• The company’s anticipated cash flows in the future</p>
<p class="C1980">• The predictability of its performance—that is, the degree of risk involved</p>
<p class="C1981">• Investors’ assessments of the expertise of a company’s management and the skills of its employees . . .</p>
<p class="C2084">. . . and of course a lot of other factors, such as the overall state of the economy, the condition of the stock market in general, the level of speculative fervor, and so on. At any given point in time, investors will disagree about a company’s “true” value, which is why some are willing to buy shares at a particular price and some are willing to sell them.</p>
<p class="P41">Sophisticated investors always look at the kinds of accounting measures we describe in this book: sales, cost of sales, operating margin, and so on. They look at a company’s physical assets, its inventories, its receivables, its level of overhead, and many other indicators. But they also understand that investment is a game of psychology as well as of economics. As the economist John Maynard Keynes once pointed out, buying stocks is like trying to anticipate who will win a beauty contest. You want to choose not the person who you think is the most beautiful but the person you think <em>everyone else </em>will see as most beautiful. So it is with stocks: prices rise not just when a company turns in great performance but when a lot of investors believe that the future will bring even better performance</p>
<p class="C2609">We hope that you now see the importance of ratios, from both a manager’s and an investor’s perspective. Although understanding the financial statements is important, it is just a start on the journey to financial intelligence. Ratios take you to the next level; they give you a way to read between (or maybe underneath) the lines, so you can really understand what is going on. They are a useful tool for analyzing your company or any other company, and for telling its financial story.</p>
