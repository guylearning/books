<p class="C2056"><strong>Spotting Assumptions, Estimates, and Biases</strong></p>
<p class="C2133">So let’s plunge a little deeper into this element of financial intelligence—understanding the “artistic” aspects of finance. Even though you’re just at the beginning of the book, this will give you a valuable perspective on the concepts and practices that you’ll learn later on. We’ll look at three examples and ask some simple but critical questions:</p>
<p class="C1980">• What were the assumptions in this number?</p>
<p class="C1980">• Are there any estimates in the numbers?</p>
<p class="C1980">• What is the bias those assumptions and estimates lead to?</p>
<p class="C1981">• What are the implications?</p>
<p class="C2051">The examples we’ll look at are accruals, depreciation, and valuation. If these words sound like part of that strange language the financial folks speak, don’t worry. You’ll be surprised how quickly you can pick up enough to get around.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong><span id="page_11">ACCRUALS </span>AND ALLOCATIONS: LOTS OF ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">At a certain time every month, you know that your company’s controller is busy “closing the books.” Here, too, is a financial puzzle: Why on earth does it take as long as it does? If you haven’t worked in finance, you might think it could take a day to add up all the end-of-the-month figures. But two or three <em>weeks</em>?</p>
<p class="P41">Well, one step that takes a lot of time is figuring out all the <em>accruals </em>and <em>allocations</em>. There’s no need to understand the details now—we’ll get to that in <a href="22_11__Asse.html#page_95">chapters 11 </a>and <a href="23_12__On_t.html#page_106">12</a>. For the moment, read the definitions in the boxes and focus on the fact that the accountants use accruals and allocations to try to create an accurate picture of the business for the month. After all, it doesn’t help anybody if the financial reports don’t tell us how much it cost us to produce the products and services we sold last month. That is what the controller’s staff is trying so hard to do, and that is one reason why it takes as long as it does.</p>
<p class="P41">Determining accruals and allocations nearly always entails making assumptions and estimates. Take your salary as an example. Say that you worked in June on a new product line and that the new line was introduced in July. Now the accountant determining the allocations has to estimate how much of your salary should be matched to the product cost (because you spent much of your time on those initial products) and how much should be charged to development costs (because you also worked on the original development of the product). She must also decide how to accrue for June versus July. Depending on how she answers questions <span id="page_12">such </span>as these, she can dramatically change the appearance of the income statement. Product cost goes into cost of goods sold. If product costs go up, gross profit goes down—and gross profit is a key measure for assessing product profitability. Development costs, however, go into R&amp;D, which is included in the operating expense section of the income statement and doesn’t affect gross profit at all.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Accruals</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">An accrual is the portion of a revenue or expense item that is recorded in a particular time span. Product development costs, for instance, are likely to be spread out over several accounting periods, and so a portion of the total cost will be <em>accrued </em>each month. The purpose of accruals is to match costs to revenues in a given time period as accurately as possible.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Allocations</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Allocations are apportionments of costs to different departments or activities within a company. For instance, overhead costs such as the CEO’s salary are often allocated to the company’s operating units.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C1984">So let’s say the accountant determined that all of your salary should go into the development cost in June, rather than the product cost in July. Her assumption is that your work wasn’t directly related to the manufacturing of the product and therefore shouldn’t be categorized as product cost. But there’s a twofold bias that results:</p>
<p class="C1980">• First, development costs are larger than they otherwise would be. An executive who analyzes those costs later on may decide that product development is too expensive and that the company shouldn’t take that risk again. If that’s what happens, the company might do less product development, thereby jeopardizing its future.</p>
<p class="C1981">• Second, the product cost is smaller than it otherwise would be. That, in turn, will affect key decisions such as pricing and hiring. Maybe the product will be priced too low. Maybe more people will be hired to put out what looks like a profitable product—even though the profit reflects some dubious assumptions.</p>
<p class="C2051">Of course, any individual’s salary won’t make much of a difference in most companies. But the assumptions that govern one person are likely to be applied across the board. To paraphrase a familiar saying in Washington, DC, a salary here and a salary there and pretty soon you’re talking real money. At any rate, this case is simple enough that you can easily see the <span id="page_13">answers </span>to the questions we posed earlier. The assumptions in the numbers? Your time was spent in development and didn’t really have much to do with the production of the product that was sold in July. The estimates? How your salary should be split, if at all, between development and product cost. The bias? Higher development costs and lower product costs. And the implications? Concern about the high cost of development; product pricing that may be too low.</p>
<p class="P41">Whoever said there is no poignancy or subtlety in finance? The accountant and finance professional labor to give the most accurate picture possible of the company’s performance. All the while they know that they will never, ever capture the exact numbers.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>DISCRETION ABOUT DEPRECIATION</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">A second example is the use of <em>depreciation</em>. The notion of depreciation isn’t complicated. Say a company buys some expensive machinery or vehicles that it expects to use for several years. Accountants think about such an event like this: rather than subtract the entire cost from one month’s revenues—perhaps plunging the company or business unit into the red for that month—we should spread the cost out over the equipment’s useful life. If we think a machine will last three years, for instance, we can record (“depreciate”) one-third of the cost per year, or one-thirty-sixth per month, using a simple method of depreciation. That’s a better way of estimating the company’s true costs in any given month or year than if we <span id="page_14">recorded </span>it all at once. Furthermore, it better matches the expenses of the equipment to the revenue that it is used to generate—an important idea that we will explore at length in <a href="14_5__Profi.html#page_43">chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Depreciation</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Depreciation is the method accountants use to allocate the cost of equipment and other assets to the total cost of products and services as shown on the income statement. It is based on the same idea as accruals: we want to match as closely as possible the costs of our products and services with what was sold. Most capital investments other than land are depreciated. Accountants attempt to spread the cost of the expenditure over the useful life of the item. There’s more about depreciation in <a href="13_PART_TWO.html#page_41">parts 2 </a>and <a href="20_PART_THR.html#page_87">3</a>.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">The theory makes perfect sense. In practice, however, accountants have a good deal of discretion as to exactly how a piece of equipment is depreciated. And that discretion can have a considerable impact. Take the airline industry. Some years back, airlines realized that their planes were lasting longer than anticipated. So the industry’s accountants changed their depreciation schedules to reflect that longer life. As a result, they subtracted less depreciation from revenue each month. And guess what? The industry’s profits rose significantly, reflecting the fact that the airlines wouldn’t have to be buying planes as soon as they had thought. But note that the accountants had to assume that they could predict how long a plane would be useful. On that judgment—and a judgment it is—hung the resulting upward bias in the profit numbers. On that judgment, too, hung all the implications: investors deciding to buy more stock, airline executives figuring they could afford to give out better raises, and so on.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>THE MANY METHODS OF VALUATION</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">A final example of the art of finance has to do with the <em>valuation </em>of a company—that is, figuring out how much a company is worth. Publicly traded companies, of course, are valued every day by the stock market. They are worth whatever their stock price is times the number of shares outstanding, a figure known as their <em>market capitalization</em>, or just market cap. But even that doesn’t necessarily capture their value in certain circumstances. A competitor bent on takeover, for instance, might decide to pay a premium for the company’s shares, because the target company is worth more to that competitor than it is on the open market. And of course, the millions of companies that are privately held aren’t valued at all on the market. When they are bought or sold, the buyers and sellers must rely on other methods of valuation.</p>
<p class="P41">Talk about the art of finance: much of the art here lies in choosing the valuation method. Different methods produce different results—which, of course, means that each method injects a bias into the numbers.</p>
<p class="P41"><span id="page_15">Suppose, </span>for example, your company proposes to acquire a closely held manufacturer of industrial valves. It’s a good fit with your business—it’s a “strategic” acquisition—but how much should your company pay? Well, you could look at the valve company’s earnings (another word for profits), then go to the public markets and see how the market values similar companies in relation to their earnings. (This is known as the <em>price-to-earnings ratio method</em>.) Or you could look at how much cash the valve company generates each year, and figure that you are, in effect, buying that stream of cash. Then you would use some interest rate to determine what that stream of future cash is worth today. (This is the <em>discounted cash flow method</em>.) Alternatively, you could simply look at the company’s assets—its plant, equipment, inventory, and so on, along with intangibles such as its reputation and customer list—and make estimates about what those assets are worth (the <em>asset valuation method</em>).</p>
<p class="P41">Needless to say, each method entails a whole passel of assumptions and estimates. The price-to-earnings method, for example, assumes that the stock market is somehow rational and that the prices it sets are therefore accurate. But of course the market isn’t wholly rational; if the market is high, the value of your target company will be higher than when the market is low. And besides, that “earnings” number, as we’ll see in <a href="13_PART_TWO.html#page_41">part 2</a>, is <em>itself </em>an estimate. So maybe, you might think, we should use the discounted cash flow method. The question with this method is, What is the right interest or “discount” rate to use when we’re calculating the value of that stream of cash? Depending on how we set it, the price could vary enormously. And of course, the asset valuation method itself is merely a collection of guesses as to what each asset might be worth.</p>
<p class="P41">As if these uncertainties weren’t enough, think back to that delightful, outrageous, nervous-making period, known as the <em>dot-com boom</em>, at the end of the twentieth century. Ambitious young Internet companies were springing up all over, fed and watered by a torrent of enthusiastic venture capital. But when investors such as venture capitalists (VCs) put their money into something, they like to know what their investment—and hence what the company—is worth. When a company is just starting up, that’s tough to know. Earnings? Zero. Operating cash flow? Also zero. Assets? Negligible. In ordinary times, that’s one reason VCs shy away from <span id="page_16">early-stage </span>investments. But in the dot-com era, they were throwing caution to the winds and so were relying on what we can only call unusual methods of valuation. They looked at the number of engineers on a company’s payroll. They counted the number of hits (“eyeballs”) a company got every month on its website. One energetic young CEO of our acquaintance raised millions of dollars based almost entirely on the fact that he had hired a large staff of software engineers. Unfortunately, we observed a “For Lease” sign in front of this company’s office less than a year later.</p>
<p class="P41">The dot-com methods of valuation look foolish now, even though back then they didn’t seem so bad, given how little we knew about what the future held. But the other methods described earlier are all reasonable. Trouble is, each has a bias that leads to different results. And the implications are far-reaching. Companies are bought and sold on the basis of these valuations. They get loans based on them. If you hold stock in your company, the value of that stock is dependent on an appropriate valuation. It seems reasonable to us that your financial intelligence should include an understanding of how those numbers are calculated.</p>
