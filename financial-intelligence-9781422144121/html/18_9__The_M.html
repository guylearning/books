<p class="C2056"><strong>The Many Forms of Profit</strong></p>
<p class="P68">So far we have covered sales or revenue—the top line—and costs and expenses. Revenue minus costs and expenses equals profit.</p>
<p class="P41">Of course, it might also equal <em>earnings, income, </em>or even <em>margin</em>. Amazingly enough, some companies use all these different terms for <em>profit</em>, sometimes in the same document. An income statement might have items labeled “gross margin,” “operating income,” “net profit,” and “earnings per share.” All these are the different types of profit typically seen on an income statement—and the company could just as easily have said “gross profit,” “operating profit,” “net profit,” and “profit per share.” When they use different words right there in the same statement, it looks as if they are talking about different concepts. But they aren’t.</p>
<p class="P41">So let’s always use the term <em>profit </em>here, and look at its various incarnations.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>GROSS PROFIT: HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH?</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Gross profit—revenue minus COGS or COS—is a key number for most companies. It tells you the basic profitability of your product or service. If that part of your business is not profitable, your company is probably not going to survive long. After all, how can you expect to pay below-the-line expenses, including management salaries, if you aren’t generating a healthy gross profit?</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong><span id="page_76">Profi</span>t</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Profit is the amount left over after expenses are subtracted from revenue. There are three basic types of profit: gross profit, operating profit, and net profit. Each one is determined by subtracting certain categories of expenses from revenue.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">But what does <em>healthy </em>mean? How much gross profit is enough? That varies substantially by industry, and it’s likely to vary from one company to another even in the same industry. In the grocery business, gross profit is typically a small percentage of sales. In the jewelry business, it’s typically a much larger percentage. Other things being equal, a company with larger revenues can thrive with a lower gross profit percentage than a smaller one. (That’s one reason why Walmart can charge such low prices.) To gauge your company’s gross profit, you can compare it with industry standards, particularly for companies of a similar size in your industry. You can also look at year-to-year trends, examining whether your gross profit is headed up or headed down. If it’s headed down, you can ask why. Are production costs rising? Is your company discounting its sales? Understanding why gross profit is changing, if it is, helps managers figure out where to focus their attention.</p>
<p class="P41">Incidentally, though most income statements follow the format we described, a small but significant number of income statements put COGS or COS under a subhead called <em>operating expenses</em>. These income statements don’t show a gross profit line at all. Microsoft is one company that uses this format. The lesson here? Pay close attention to the line items, and use <span id="page_77">your </span>own financial intelligence to assess how a company has organized its expenses, and therefore how you should assess the profit lines.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Gross Profit</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Gross profit is sales minus cost of goods sold or cost of services. It is what is left over after a company has paid the direct costs incurred in making the product or delivering the service. Gross profit must be sufficient to cover a business’s operating expenses, taxes, financing costs, and net profit.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">Here too, however, you need to keep a sharp eye out for possible bias in the numbers. <em>Gross profit can be greatly affected by decisions about when to recognize revenue and by decisions about what to include in COGS</em>. Suppose you are HR director for a market research firm and you find that gross profit is headed downward. You look into the numbers, and at first it appears that service costs have gone up. So you and your team begin anticipating cuts in service costs, perhaps even including some layoffs. But when you do some more digging, you find that salaries that were previously in operating expenses have been moved into COGS. So service costs did not go up, and laying off people would be a mistake. Now you have to talk with the people in accounting. Why did they move those salaries? Why didn’t they tell you? If those salaries are to remain in COGS, then maybe the firm’s gross profit targets need to be reduced. But nothing else needs to change.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>OPERATING PROFIT IS A KEY TO HEALTH</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Operating profit—gross profit minus operating expenses or SG&amp;A, including depreciation and amortization—is also known by the peculiar acronym EBIT (pronounced <em>EE-bit</em>). EBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes. (Remember, <em>earnings </em>is just another name for profit). What has <em>not </em>yet been subtracted from revenue is interest and taxes. Why not? Because <em>operating profit is the profit a company earns from the business it is in</em>—from operations. Taxes don’t really have anything to do with how well you are running your business. And interest expenses depend on whether the company is financed with debt or equity (we’ll explain this difference <span id="page_78">in </span><a href="23_12__On_t.html#page_106">chapter 12</a>). But the financial structure of the company doesn’t say anything about how well it is run from an operational perspective.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Operating Profit, or EBIT</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Operating profit is gross profit minus operating expenses, which include depreciation and amortization. In other words, it shows the profit made from running the business.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">So operating profit, or EBIT, is a good gauge of how well a company is being managed. It’s watched closely by all stakeholders because it measures both overall demand for the company’s products or services (sales) and the company’s efficiency in delivering those products or services (costs). Bankers and investors look at operating profit to see whether the company will be able to pay its debts and earn money for its shareholders. Vendors look at it to see if the company will be able to pay its bills. (As we’ll see later, however, operating profit is not always the best gauge of this.) Large customers examine operating profit to ascertain whether the company is doing an efficient job and is likely to be around for a while. Even savvy employees check out the operating profit figures. A healthy and growing operating profit suggests that the employees are going to be able to keep their jobs and may have opportunities for advancement.</p>
<p class="P41">However, remember that potential biases in the numbers can impact operating profit as well. Are there any one-time charges? What is the depreciation line? As we have seen, depreciation can be altered to affect profits one way or another. For a while, Wall Street analysts were watching companies’ operating profit, or EBIT, closely. But some companies that were later revealed to have committed fraud turned out to be playing games with depreciation (remember Waste Management), so their EBIT numbers were suspect. Before long, Wall Street began focusing on another number—EBITDA (pronounced <em>EE-bid-dah</em>), or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Some people feel EBITDA is a better measure of a company’s operating efficiency, because it ignores noncash charges such as depreciation altogether. (More recently, another number—free cash flow—has become the darling of Wall Street. You’ll learn about it in the <a href="33_Part_Fou.html#page_152">toolbox</a> following part 4.)</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>NET PROFIT AND HOW TO FIX IT</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Now, finally, let’s get to the bottom line. Net profit. It is usually the last line on the income statement. Net profit is what is left over after everything is subtracted—cost of goods sold or cost of services, operating expenses, one-time charges, noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, <span id="page_79"></span>interest, and taxes. When someone asks, “What’s the bottom line?” he or she is almost always referring to net profit. Some of the key numbers used to measure a company, such as earnings per share and price/earnings ratio, are based on net profit. Yes, it is strange that they don’t just call them profit per share and price/profit ratio. But they don’t.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Net Profit</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Net profit is the bottom line of the income statement: what’s left after <em>all </em>costs and expenses are subtracted from revenue. It’s operating profit minus interest expenses, taxes, one-time charges, and any other costs not included in operating profit.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">What if a company’s net profit is lower than it ought to be? This can be a big issue, particularly because executives’ bonuses may be tied to profit targets. On occasion, some decide to skirt accounting rules to improve the profit picture. Fannie Mae, for instance—the government-sponsored enterprise that plays a significant role in the US mortgage market—was charged with “extensive financial fraud” over the six-year period from 1998 to 2004. The goal of the fraud was to make it look as if earnings were right on target so that its executives would receive incentive payouts worth millions of dollars.<sup><a id="id_143" href="57_Notes.html#id_289">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="P41">Aside from monkeying with the books, there are only three possible fixes for low profitability. One, the company can increase profitable sales. This solution almost always requires a good deal of time. You have to find new markets or new prospects, work through the sales cycle, and so on. Two, it can figure out how to lower production costs and run more efficiently—that is, reduce COGS. This, too, takes time: you need to study the production process, find the inefficiencies, and implement changes. Three, it can cut operating expenses, which almost always means reducing the headcount. This is usually the only short-term solution available. That’s why so many CEOs taking over troubled companies start by cutting the payroll in the overhead expense areas. It makes earnings look better fast.</p>
<p class="P41">Of course, layoffs can backfire. Morale suffers. Good people whom the new CEO wants to keep may begin looking for jobs elsewhere. And that’s <span id="page_80">not </span>the only danger. For example, “Chainsaw Al” Dunlap used the laypeople-off strategy a number of times to pump up the earnings of companies he took over, and Wall Street usually rewarded him for it. But the strategy didn’t work when he got to Sunbeam. Yes, he slashed headcount, and yes, earnings rose. In fact, Wall Street was so enthusiastic about the company’s pumped-up profitability that it bid Sunbeam’s shares way up. But Dunlap’s strategy all along had been to sell the company at a profit—and now, with its shares selling at a premium, the company was too expensive for prospective buyers to consider. Without a buyer, Sunbeam was forced to limp along until its problems became apparent and Chainsaw Al was forced out by the board.</p>
<p class="P41">The moral? For most companies, it’s better to manage for the long haul and to focus on increasing profitable sales and reducing costs. Sure, operating expenses may have to be trimmed. But if that’s your only focus, you’re probably only postponing the day of reckoning.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>CONTRIBUTION MARGIN—A DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT PROFIT</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">So far we have examined three different levels of profit—gross profit, operating profit, and net profit. All reflect the fact that an income statement is organized in a certain sequence: you begin with revenue, subtract COGS to get gross profit, subtract operating expenses to get operating profit, subtract taxes and interest and everything else to get net profit. If you categorized expenses differently, however, you would come up with a different measure of profit, and perhaps you could learn more about how well you are managing. That’s the thinking behind a particular form of profit known as <em>contribution margin</em>.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Contribution Margin</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Contribution margin indicates how much profit you are earning on the goods or services you sell, without accounting for your company’s fixed costs. To calculate it, just subtract variable costs from sales.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051"><span id="page_81">Contribution </span>margin is sales minus variable costs. It shows the profit you are earning on what you sell before you account for fixed costs. Remember what we discussed in <a href="17_8__Costs.html#page_63">chapter 8</a>: variable costs are not the same as COGS or COS. So contribution margin is not the same as gross profit.</p>
<p class="P41" style="margin-bottom:8px;">Here is what an income statement used for contribution margin analysis looks like:</p>
<p class="C2343" style="margin-top:8px;"><strong>CONTRIBUTION MARGIN ANALYSIS INCOME STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p class="P41">Revenue</p>
<p class="P41"><span class="Underline">Variable costs</span></p>
<p class="P41"><strong>Contribution margin</strong></p>
<p class="P41"><span class="Underline">Fixed costs</span></p>
<p class="P41"><strong>Operating profit</strong></p>
<p class="P41"><span class="Underline">Interest/taxes</span></p>
<p class="P41"><span class="Underline1"><span class="Underline"><strong>Net profit (loss)</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="C2051">Contribution margin shows you the aggregate amount of margin available after variable costs to cover fixed expenses and provide profit to the company. In effect, it shows you how much you must produce to cover your fixed costs.</p>
<p class="P41">Contribution margin analysis also helps managers compare products, make decisions about whether to add or subtract a product line, decide how to price a product or service, and even how to structure sales commissions. For example, a company should probably keep a product line with a positive contribution margin even if its conventionally calculated profit is negative. The contribution margin it generates helps pay for fixed costs. If its contribution margin is negative, however, the company loses money with each unit it produces. Since it can’t make up that kind of loss with volume, it should either drop the product line or increase prices.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATES ON PROFITABILITY</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Sometimes operating managers have no control over factors that affect profit. An example is exchange rates—which, in our global economy, loom ever larger in many companies’ calculations.</p>
<p class="P41">An exchange rate is just the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency. An American visiting Hong Kong in autumn 2011, for <span id="page_82">example, </span>could have bought about 7.8 Hong Kong dollars (HKD) for one US dollar. The price of those 7.8 HKD, in other words, is $1.00. However, exchange rates vary significantly over time. The fluctuations depend on trade flows, government budgets, relative interest rates, and a host of other variables.</p>
<p class="P41">Whenever a company from one country does business in another, the profitability of its operations will be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. In the simplest case, imagine that a US manufacturer sells machines in Hong Kong for 780,000 HKD, or about $100,000 (in late 2011). Then suppose that the US dollar declines in value relative to the HKD—that is, you now need more than $1.00 to buy 7.8 HKD. Let’s say the new rate is 6.8 HKD to the dollar. The manufacturer receives the same 780,000 HKD for its machines, but that money is now worth $114,706. Other things equal, those sales are 14.7 percent more profitable than they used to be. The manufacturer can pocket the difference, or it can decide to reduce prices to increase demand. The opposite will hold true, of course, if the US dollar increases in value relative to the HKD. In that case, people and companies who buy from Hong Kong will gain, and those who sell there will lose.</p>
<p class="P41">Many companies, of course, have highly complex overseas operations. They produce some products at home and some in foreign countries. They ship goods in both directions, and from one foreign country to another. Every international transaction involves some risk that exchange rates will fluctuate in the wrong direction, and that profits on the transaction will be less than expected.</p>
<p class="P41">Though operating managers can’t do much about exchange rates themselves, the financial folks can and do take action to protect themselves against these risks, For example, they can purchase financial instruments that allow them to buy or sell certain currencies at predetermined prices, thus locking in exchange rates. This kind of hedge, as it is known in the financial world, helps protect against unexpected rate changes. Of course, hedges cost money, and they don’t always work perfectly. So while a company can reduce the effects of exchange rates on profitability, it can rarely eliminate them.</p>
