<p class="C2056"><strong>Revenue</strong></p>
<p class="C2264"><strong>The Issue Is Recognition</strong></p>
<p class="P68">We’ll begin at the top. We already noted that <em>sales</em>—the top line of an income statement—is also often called <em>revenue</em>. So far so good: only two words for the same thing isn’t too bad, and we’ll use both, just because they’re so common. But watch out: some companies (and many people) call that top line “income.” In fact, the popular accounting software QuickBooks labels it income. Most banks and financial institutions also call it income. That’s <em>really </em>confusing because “income” more often means “profit,” which is the <em>bottom </em>line. (Obviously, we have an uphill battle here. Where are the language police when you need them?)</p>
<p class="P41">A company can <em>record </em>or <em>recognize </em>a sale when it delivers a product or service to a customer. That’s a simple principle. But as we suggested earlier in the book, when you put it into practice, you immediately run into complexity. In fact, the issue of when a sale can be recorded is one of the more artful aspects of the income statement. It’s the one where accountants have the most discretion and that managers therefore must understand most closely. So this is one place where your skills as an educated consumer of the financials will come in handy. If things don’t seem right, ask questions—and if you can’t get satisfactory answers, it might be time to be concerned. Revenue recognition is a common arena for financial fraud.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong><span id="page_57">Sales</span></strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Sales or revenue is the dollar value of all the products or services a company provided to its customers during a given period of time.</p>
<p class="C2809b">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>MURKY GUIDELINES</strong></p>
<p class="C2118">The most important GAAP guideline that accountants rely on for recording or recognizing a sale is that the revenue must have been <em>earned</em>. A products company must have shipped the product. A service company must have performed the work. Fair enough—but what would you do about these situations?</p>
<p class="C1980">• Your company does systems integration for large customers. A typical project requires six months to design and be approved by the customer, then another twelve months to implement. The customer gets no real value from the project until the whole thing is complete. When have you earned the revenue that the project generates?</p>
<p class="C1980">• Your company sells to retailers. Using a practice known as bill-and-hold, you allow your customers to buy product (say, a popular Christmas item) well in advance of the time they will actually need it. You warehouse it for them and ship it out later. When have you earned the revenue?</p>
<p class="C1981">• You work for an architectural firm. The firm provides clients with plans for buildings, deals with the local building authorities, and supervises the construction or reconstruction. All these services are included in the firm’s fee, which is generally figured as a percentage of construction costs. How do you determine when the firm has earned its revenue?</p>
<p class="C2051">We can’t provide exact answers to these questions, because accounting practices differ from one company to another. But that’s precisely the point: there are no hard-and-fast answers. Project-based companies <span id="page_58">typically </span>have rules allowing partial revenue recognition when a project reaches certain milestones. But the rules can vary. The “sales” figure on a company’s top line always reflects the accountants’ judgments about when they should recognize revenue. And where there is judgment, there is room for dispute—not to say manipulation.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>POSSIBILITIES FOR MANIPULATION</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">In fact, the pressures for manipulation can be intense. Let’s take a software company, for example. And let’s say that it sells software along with maintenance-and-upgrade contracts extending over a period of five years. So it has to make a judgment about when to recognize revenue from a sale.</p>
<p class="P41">Now suppose this software company is actually a division of a large corporation, one that makes earnings predictions to Wall Street. The folks in the corporate office want to keep Wall Street happy. This quarter, alas, it looks as if the parent company is going to miss its earnings per share forecast by just a little bit. If it does, Wall Street will not be happy. And when Wall Street isn’t happy, the company’s stock gets hammered.</p>
<p class="P41">Aha! (You can hear the folks in the corporate office thinking.) Here is this software division. Suppose we change how its revenue is recognized? Suppose we recognize 75 percent up front instead of 50 percent? The logic might be that a sale in this business takes a lot of initial work, so they should recognize the cost and effort of making the sale as well as the cost of providing the product and delivering the service. Make the change—recognize the extra revenue—and suddenly earnings per share are nudged up to where Wall Street expects them to be.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Earnings per Share</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Earnings per share (EPS) is a company’s net profit divided by the number of shares outstanding. It’s one of the numbers that Wall Street watches most closely. Wall Street has “expectations” for many companies’ EPS, and if the expectations aren’t met, the share price is likely to drop.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C1984"><span id="page_59">Interestingly, </span>such a change is not illegal. An explanation might appear in a footnote to the financial statements, but then again it might not. Maybe you noticed in <a href="15_6__Crack.html#page_48">chapter 6 </a>that the Hewlett-Packard footnote regarding revenue recognition policy mentioned 2009 and 2010. That’s because later in that same section the company describes what it did differently in 2008:</p>
<p class="C2115"><em>For fiscal 2008 . . . HP allocated revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, or for software, based on VSOE of fair value. In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, HP first allocated revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements . . .</em></p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2084">. . . And so on, for many more lines.</p>
<p class="P41">As we mentioned in <a href="11_4__The_R.html#page_26">chapter 4</a>, any accounting change that is “material” to the bottom line must be footnoted in this manner. But who decides what is material and what isn’t? You guessed it: the accountants. In fact, it could very well be that recognizing 75 percent up front presents a more accurate picture of the software division’s reality. But was the change in accounting method due to good financial analysis, or did it reflect the need to make the earnings forecast? Could there be a bias lurking in here? Remember, accounting is the art of using limited data to come as close as possible to an accurate description of how well a company is performing. Revenue on the income statement is an estimate, a best guess. This example shows how estimates can introduce bias.</p>
<p class="P41">It isn’t just investors who have to be careful about bias; managers, too, need to be aware of it because it can directly affect their jobs. Say you’re a sales manager, and you and your staff focus on the revenue numbers every month. You manage your people based on those numbers. You talk with them about their performance. You make decisions about hiring and firing, and you hand out rewards and recognition, all according to the numbers. Now your company does what the software company did: it changes the way it recognizes revenue in order to achieve some corporate goal. Suddenly it looks as if your staff is doing great! Bonuses for everyone! But be careful: the underlying revenue figures might not look so good if they were recognized in the same way as before. If you didn’t know the policy had changed and you began passing out bonuses, you’d be paying for no real <span id="page_60">improvement. </span>Financial intelligence in this case means understanding how the revenue is recognized, analyzing the real variances in the sales figures, and paying bonuses (or not) based on true changes in performance.</p>
<p class="P41">Just as an aside, the most common source of accounting fraud has been and probably always will be in that top line: sales. Many companies play with revenue recognition in questionable ways. The issue is particularly acute in the software industry. Software companies often sell their products to resellers, who then sell the products to end users. Manufacturers, under pressure from Wall Street to make their numbers, are frequently tempted to ship unordered software to these distributors at the end of a quarter. (The practice is known as <em>channel stuffing</em>.) And it isn’t just software. Vitesse Semiconductor, for instance, was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2010 for a series of practices conducted by its then–executive team from 1995 to 2006. Among the charges: “an elaborate channel stuffing scheme in order to improperly record revenue on product shipments.” The distributor to which Vitesse shipped its wares had an “unconditional right” to send the goods back, a right established through “side letters and oral agreements.” Vitesse and the executives settled the charges, and the company later acknowledged that it had “utilized improper accounting practices primarily related to revenue recognition and inventory, and prepared or altered financial records to conceal those practices.” A new management team subsequently cleaned things up.<sup><a id="id_126" href="57_Notes.html#id_287">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="P41">One company that always took the high road in regard to this practice was Macromedia, creators of the Internet Flash player and other products. When channel stuffing was becoming a serious problem in the industry, Macromedia voluntarily reported estimates of inventory held by its distributors, thereby showing that the channels for its products were not artificially loaded up. The message was clear to shareholders and employees alike: Macromedia was not going to be dragged into this practice. (Macromedia has since been acquired by Adobe.)</p>
<p class="P41">The next time you read about a financial scandal, check first to see whether somebody was messing around with the revenue numbers. Unfortunately, it is all too common.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong><span id="page_61">BACKLOG </span>AND BOOKINGS</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Fraud and manipulation aside, revenue shows the dollar volume of the goods or services the company has delivered to its customers. But it’s not the only significant measure of a company’s sales success. Equally important, in many cases, are the orders that have been signed but not yet started, or the revenue not yet recognized on partially completed projects. This is the value, in other words, of what’s in the pipeline. Companies variously refer to these not-yet-recognized sales as <em>backlog </em>or <em>bookings</em>.</p>
<p class="P41">Many public companies report backlog or bookings to help keep analysts and shareholders informed about the companies’ future prospects. They may publish the figures in a variety of ways. One of our clients, for example, tracks both the total value of its contracts and the annual value. Of course, bookings can change from one day to the next as new orders come in, existing orders are canceled or amended, and work proceeds on partially completed projects.</p>
<p class="P41">In some cases, you may have to ask questions to determine what a particular trend in backlog or bookings means. For example, a growing backlog might indicate increasing sales—or it might mean that the company is experiencing production problems. A falling backlog might indicate declining sales or greater production capacity. One metric that can help you figure out what’s going on is the company’s assessment of how much of the backlog will convert to sales in a given period of time. A company might say, for instance, that it expects approximately 75 percent of the backlog to turn into sales in the following six months.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>DEFERRED REVENUE</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">When you buy an airplane ticket, the airline charges your credit card immediately, even if you are not planning to fly for another three weeks. Accountants call such funds <em>deferred revenue</em>.</p>
<p class="P41">Because of its name, deferred revenue sounds like something we should discuss in this chapter. Deferred revenue is indeed related to revenue—it will turn into revenue eventually—but it does not belong here. Remember the GAAP principle of conservatism? It says, in part, that revenue should be recognized when (and only when) it is actually earned. Deferred <span id="page_62">revenue </span>is money that has come in but is as yet unearned. So it can’t go into the income statement. Instead, accountants put deferred revenue on the balance sheet as a liability—that is, an amount that the company owes to somebody else. In the example, the airline owes you a flight. We’ll discuss deferred revenue further in <a href="20_PART_THR.html#page_87">part 3</a>.</p>
