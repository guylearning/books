<p class="C1971"><strong><a id="id_105"></a>GETTING WHAT YOU WANT</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Imagine the shock on your boss’s face if you made a case for a raise—and part of your case included a detailed analysis of the company’s financial picture, showing exactly how your unit has contributed.</p>
<p class="C1974">Far-fetched? Not really. Once you read this book, you’ll know how to gather and interpret data such as the following:</p>
<p class="C1980">•<em> The company’s revenue growth, profit growth, and margin improvements over the past year. </em>If the business is doing well, senior managers may be thinking about new plans and opportunities. They’ll need experienced people—like you.</p>
<p class="C1980">• <em>The company’s remaining financial challenges</em>. Could inventory turns be improved? What about gross margins or receivable days? If you can suggest specific ways to better the business’s financial performance, both you and your boss will look smart.</p>
<p class="C1981">• <em>Your company’s cash flow position</em>. Maybe you’ll be able to show that your company has lots of free cash flow for raises for its hardworking employees.</p>
<p class="C1984">The same goes for when you apply for that next job. The experts always tell job seekers to ask questions of the interviewer—and if you ask financial questions, you’ll show that you understand the financial side of the business. Try questions like these:</p>
<p class="C1980"><span id="page_37">• </span>Is the company profitable?</p>
<p class="C1980">• Does it have positive equity?</p>
<p class="C1980">• Does it have a current ratio that can support payroll?</p>
<p class="C1981">• Are revenues growing or declining?</p>
<p class="C2084">If you don’t know how to assess all these, read the rest of this book—you’ll learn.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong><a id="id_107"></a>THE PLAYERS AND WHAT THEY DO</strong></p>
<p class="C2118">Who’s really in charge of finance and accounting? Titles and responsibilities differ from one company to another, but here’s an overview of who usually does what in the upper echelons of these departments:</p>
<p class="C1980">• <em>Chief financial officer (CFO)</em>. The CFO is involved in the management and strategy of the organization from a financial perspective. He or she oversees all financial functions; the company controller and treasurer report to the CFO. The CFO is usually part of the executive committee and often sits on the board of directors. For financial matters, the buck stops here.</p>
<p class="C1980">• <em>Treasurer</em>. The treasurer focuses outside the company as well as inside. He or she is responsible for building and maintaining banking relationships, managing cash flow, forecasting, and making equity and capital-structure decisions. The treasurer is also responsible for investor relations and stock-based equity decisions. Some would say that the ideal treasurer is a finance professional with a personality.</p>
<p class="C1980">• <em>Controller</em>. The focus of the controller—sometimes spelled <em>comptroller</em>—is purely internal. His or her job is providing reliable and accurate financial reports. The controller is responsible for general accounting, financial reporting, business analysis, financial planning, asset management, and internal controls. He or she ensures that day-to-day transactions are recorded accurately and correctly. Without good, consistent data from the controller, the CFO and the treasurer can’t <span id="page_38">do </span>their jobs. The controller is sometimes called a bean counter. It’s wise to use this term correctly; some CFOs and treasurers get annoyed when it is used to describe them, as they do not consider themselves bean counters but financial professionals.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong><a id="id_109"></a>REPORTING OBLIGATIONS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Publicly traded companies—companies whose stocks anyone can buy on an exchange—must ordinarily file a number of reports with a government agency. In the United States, that agency is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Of the forms required by the SEC, the most commonly known and utilized is the annual report, known as Form 10-K or just a 10-K. This is not the same thing as the glossy brochure many companies distribute to their shareholders, which is also called an annual report. The glossy version usually features a letter from the CEO and chairman; it may also include promotional information about the company’s products and services, pie charts and colored graphs, and other marketing-related content. The SEC version—the 10-K—is usually drab black and white, with pages upon pages of text and data, all required by SEC regulations. It includes items such as company history, executive compensation, risks in the business, legal proceedings, management discussion of the business, financial statements (prepared according to GAAP, as described in <a href="11_4__The_R.html#page_26">chapter 4</a>), notes to the financial statements, and financial controls and procedures. You can learn a lot from it.</p>
<p class="P41">Public companies also must file a report known as a 10-Q every three months. The 10-Q is much shorter than the 10-K; most of it is devoted to reporting a company’s financial results for the most recent quarter. Companies produce only three 10-Qs because they include the final quarter in their 10-Ks.</p>
<p class="P41">Note that quarter ends and year ends do not have to correspond to the calendar. The end of a company’s fiscal year can be any date that the company establishes, and the quarters are calculated from that. For example, if a company’s year end is January 31, then its quarters are February through April, May through July, August through October, and November through January.</p>
<p class="P41"><span id="page_39">You </span>can find 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and other forms that are required SEC filings on the websites of individual companies and on the SEC’s website. The latter uses a database called EDGAR and contains a tutorial on how to use it.</p>
