<p class="C2056"><strong>Why Increase Your Financial Intelligence?</strong></p>
<p class="P68">So far our discussion has been pretty abstract. We have been introducing you to the art of finance and explaining why understanding it is an essential ingredient of financial intelligence. Now let’s revisit the issue we posed in the preface: the benefits of financial intelligence. With a little art-of-finance discussion under your belt, you can understand in greater depth what this book can teach you and what you will gain from reading it.</p>
<p class="P41">For starters, we want to emphasize that this book is different from other finance books. It doesn’t presuppose any financial knowledge. But neither is it another version of <em>Accounting for Dummies</em>. We will never mention debits and credits. We won’t ever refer to the general ledger or trial balances. This book is about financial intelligence, or, as the subtitle says, <em>knowing what the numbers really mean</em>. It’s written not for would-be accountants but for people in organizations—leaders, managers, employees—who need to understand what is happening in their company from a financial perspective and who can use that information to work and manage more effectively. In it, you’ll learn how to decipher the financial statements, how to identify potential biases in the numbers, and how to use the information in the statements to do your job better. You’ll learn how to calculate ratios. You’ll learn about return on investment (ROI) and working capital management, two <span id="page_18">concepts </span>that you can use to improve your decision making and impact on the organization. In short, you will boost your financial intelligence.</p>
<p class="P41">If you boost your financial intelligence, moreover, you will very likely stand out from the crowd. Not long ago, we conducted a national study, giving a twenty-one-question finance exam to a representative sample of nonfinancial managers in the United States. The questions were all based on concepts that any company executive or junior finance person would know. Unfortunately, the managers scored an average of only 38 percent—a failing grade by any standard. To judge by their answers, a majority were unable to distinguish profit from cash. Many didn’t know the difference between an income statement and a balance sheet. About 70 percent couldn’t pick the correct definition of free cash flow, now the measure of choice for many Wall Street investors.<sup><a id="id_89" href="57_Notes.html#id_283">1 </a></sup>By the time you finish this book, you will know all that material, and a good deal more besides. That’s what we mean by standing out from the crowd.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>THE BENEFITS OF FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">But it isn’t just a matter of scoring well on a test; financial intelligence brings with it a host of practical benefits. Here’s a short list of the advantages you’ll gain.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Increased Ability to Critically Evaluate Your Company</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Do you really know if your employer has enough cash to make payroll? Do you know how profitable the products or services you work on really are? When it comes to capital-expenditure proposals, is the ROI analysis based on solid data? Boost your financial intelligence, and you’ll gain more insight into questions like these. Or maybe you’ve had nightmares in which you worked at AIG, Lehman Brothers, or maybe Washington Mutual. Many of the people at those companies had no inkling of their precarious situation.</p>
<p class="P41">Suppose, for instance, you worked at the big telecommunications company WorldCom (later known as MCI) during the late 1990s. WorldCom’s strategy was to grow through acquisition. Trouble was, the company wasn’t generating enough cash for the acquisitions it wanted to make. So it used stock as its currency and paid for the companies it acquired partly with <span id="page_19">WorldCom </span>shares. That meant it absolutely had to keep its share price high; otherwise, the acquisitions would be too expensive. And if you want to keep your share price high, you’d better keep your profits high. Moreover, WorldCom paid for the acquisitions through borrowing. A company doing a lot of borrowing also has to keep its profits up; otherwise, the banks will stop lending it money. So on two fronts, WorldCom was under severe pressure to report high profits.</p>
<p class="P41">That, of course, was the source of the fraud that was ultimately uncovered. The company artificially boosted profits “with a variety of accounting tricks, including understating expenses and treating operating costs as capital expenditures,” as <em>Business Week </em>summarized the Justice Department’s indictment.<sup><a id="id_91" href="57_Notes.html#id_284">2 </a></sup>When everybody learned that WorldCom was not as profitable as it had claimed to be, the house of cards came tumbling down. But even if there hadn’t been fraud, WorldCom’s ability to generate cash was out of step with its growth-by-acquisitions strategy. It could live on borrowing and stock for a while, but not forever.</p>
<p class="P41">Or look at Tyco International. For a while, Tyco was another big acquirer of companies. In fact, it bought some six hundred companies in just two years, or more than one every working day. With all those acquisitions, the goodwill number on Tyco’s balance sheet grew to the point where bankers began to get nervous. Bankers and investors don’t like to see too much goodwill on a balance sheet; they prefer assets that you can touch (and in a pinch, sell off). So when word spread that there might be some <span id="page_20">accounting </span>irregularities at Tyco, the bankers effectively shut the company off from further acquisitions immediately. Today Tyco is focusing on organic growth and operational excellence rather than on acquisitions; its financial picture matches its strategy.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Goodwill</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Goodwill comes into play when one company acquires another company. It is the difference between the net assets acquired (that is, the fair market value of the assets less the assumed liabilities) and the amount of money the acquiring company pays for them. For example, if a company’s net assets are valued at $1 million and the acquirer pays $3 million, then goodwill of $2 million goes onto the acquirer’s balance sheet. That $2 million reflects all the value that is not reflected in the acquiree’s tangible assets—for example, its name, reputation, and so on.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Balance Sheet</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">The balance sheet reflects the assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity at a point in time. In other words, it shows, on a specific day, what the company owned, what it owed, and how much it was worth. The balance sheet is called such because it balances—assets always must equal liabilities plus owners’ equity. A financially savvy manager knows that all the financial statements ultimately flow to the balance sheet. We’ll explain all these notions in <a href="20_PART_THR.html#page_87">part 3</a>.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">Now, we’re not arguing that every financially intelligent manager would have been able to spot AIG’s or Tyco’s precarious situation. Plenty of seemingly savvy Wall Street types were fooled by the two companies. Still, a little more knowledge will give you the tools to watch trends at your company and understand more of the stories behind the numbers. While you might not have all of the answers, you should know what questions to ask when you don’t. It’s always worth your while to assess your company’s performance and prospects. You’ll learn to gauge how it’s doing and to figure out how you can best support those goals and be successful yourself.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Better Understanding of the Bias in the Numbers</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">We’ve already discussed the bias that is built into many numbers. But so what? What will understanding the bias do for you? One very big thing: it will give you the knowledge and the confidence—the financial intelligence—to <em>question the data provided by your finance and accounting department</em>. You will be able to identify the hard data, the assumptions, and the estimates. You will know—and others will, too—when your decisions and actions are on solid ground.</p>
<p class="P41">Let’s say you work in operations, and you are proposing the purchase of some new equipment. Your boss says he’ll listen, but he wants you to justify <span id="page_21">the </span>purchase. That means digging up data from finance, including cash flow analysis for the machine, working capital requirements, and depreciation schedules. All these numbers—surprise!—are based on assumptions and estimates. If you know what they are, you can examine them to see if they make sense. If they don’t, you can change the assumptions, modify the estimates, and put together an analysis that is realistic and that (hopefully) supports your proposal. Joe, for example, likes to tell audiences that a financially savvy engineer could easily come up with an analysis showing how his company should buy him a $5,000 CAD/CAM machine, complete with the latest software. The engineer would assume that he could save an hour a day because of the new computer’s features and processing speed; he would calculate the value of an hour per day of his time over a year; and—presto!—he would show that buying the machine is a no-brainer. A financially intelligent boss, however, would take a look at those assumptions and posit some alternatives, such as that the engineer might actually <em>lose </em>an hour a day of work while he played with all the cool features on the new machine.</p>
<p class="P41">It’s amazing, in fact, how easily a financially knowledgeable manager can change the terms of discussion so that better decisions get made. When he worked for Ford Motor Company, Joe had an experience that underlined just that lesson. He and several other finance folks were presenting financial results to a senior marketing director. After they sat down, the director looked straight at them and said, “Before I open these finance reports, I need to know . . . for how long and at what temperature?” Joe and the others had no idea what he was talking about. Then the light went on and Joe replied, “Yes, sir, they were in for two hours at 350°.” The director said, “OK, now that I know how long you cooked ’em, let’s begin.” He was telling the finance people that he knew there were assumptions and estimates in the numbers and that he was going to ask questions. When he asked in the meeting how solid a given number was, the financial people were comfortable explaining where the number came from and the assumptions, if any, they had to make. The director could then take the numbers and use them to make decisions he felt comfortable with.</p>
<p class="P41">Absent such knowledge, what happens? Simple: the people from accounting and finance control the decisions. We use the word <em>control </em><span id="page_22">because </span>when decisions are based on numbers, and when the numbers are based on accountants’ assumptions and estimates, then the accountants and finance folks have effective control (even if they aren’t trying to control anything). That’s why you need to know what questions to ask.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>The Ability to Use Numbers and Financial Tools to Make and Analyze Decisions</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">What is the ROI of that project? Why can’t we spend money when our company is profitable? Why do I have to focus on accounts receivable when I am not in the accounting department? You ask yourself these and other questions every day (or someone else asks them—and assumes you know the answers!). You are expected to use financial knowledge to make decisions, to direct your subordinates, and to plan the future of your department or company. We will show you how to do this, give you examples, and discuss what to do with the results. In the process, we’ll try to use as little financial jargon as possible.</p>
<p class="P41">For example, let’s look at why the finance department might tell you not to spend any money, even though the company is profitable.</p>
<p class="P41">We’ll start with the basic fact that cash and profit are different. In <a href="29_16__Prof.html#page_129">chapter 16 </a>we’ll explain why, but right now let’s just focus on the basics. Profit is based on revenue. Revenue, remember, is recognized when a product or service is delivered, not when the bill is paid. So the top line of the income statement, the line from which we subtract expenses to determine profit, is often no more than a promise. Customers have not paid yet, so the revenue number does not reflect real money and neither does the profit line at the bottom. If everything goes well, the company will eventually collect its receivables and will have cash corresponding to that profit. In the meantime, it doesn’t.</p>
<p class="P41">Now suppose you’re working for a fast-growing business services company. The company is selling a lot of services at a good price, so its revenues and profits are high. It is hiring people as fast as it can, and of course it has to pay them as soon as they come on board. But all the profit that these people are earning won’t turn into cash until thirty days or maybe sixty days after it is billed out! That’s one reason why even the CFO of a highly profitable company may sometimes say, don’t spend any money right now because cash is tight.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong><span id="page_23">Cash</span></strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Cash as presented on the balance sheet means the money a company has in the bank, plus anything else (like stocks and bonds) that can readily be turned into cash. Really, it’s that simple. Later we’ll discuss measures of cash flow. For now, just know that when companies talk about cash, it really is the cold, hard stuff.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">Although this book focuses on increasing your financial intelligence in business, you can also apply what you’ll learn in your personal life. Consider your decisions to purchase a house, a car, or a boat. The knowledge you’ll gain can apply to those decisions as well. Or consider how you plan for the future and decide how to invest. This book is not about investing, but it is about understanding company financials, which will help you analyze possible investment opportunities.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>HOW IT BENEFITS A COMPANY</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Our day job is teaching financial literacy, thereby (we hope) increasing the financial intelligence of the leaders, managers, and employees who are our students. So naturally, we think it’s an important subject for our students to learn. But what we have also seen in our work is how increasing financial intelligence benefits companies. Again, here is a short list of advantages.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Strength and Balance Throughout the Organization</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Do the finance folks dominate decisions? They shouldn’t. The strength of their department should be balanced by the strength of operations, of marketing, of human resources, of customer service, of information technology, and so on. If managers in those other departments are not financially savvy, if they don’t understand how financial results are measured and how to use those results to critically evaluate the company, then accounting and finance necessarily have the upper hand. The bias they inject into the numbers affects and can even determine decision making.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong><span id="page_24">Better </span>Decisions</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Managers routinely incorporate what they know about the marketplace, the competition, the customers, and so on into their decisions. When they also incorporate financial analysis, their decisions are better. We are not big believers in making decisions solely on the basis of the numbers. But we do think that ignoring what the numbers tell you is pretty silly. Good financial analysis gives managers a window into the future and helps them make smarter, more informed choices.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Greater Alignment</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Imagine the power in your organization if <em>everyone </em>understood the financial side of the business. Everyone might actually work in alignment with the strategy and goals. Everyone might work as a team to achieve healthy profitability and cash flow. Everyone might communicate in the language of business instead of jockeying for position through office politics. Wow.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>ROADBLOCKS TO FINANCIAL SAVVY</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">We have worked with enough people and companies to know that while the results everyone wants might be great, they aren’t so easy to attain. In fact, we run into several predictable obstacles, both personal and organizational.</p>
<p class="P41">One obstacle might be that you hate math, fear math, and don’t want to do math. Well, join the club. It might surprise you to know that, for the most part, finance involves addition and subtraction. When finance people get really fancy, they multiply and divide. We never have to take the second derivative of a function or determine the area under a curve (sorry, engineers). So have no fear: the math is easy. And calculators are cheap. You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to be financially intelligent.</p>
<p class="P41">A second possible obstacle: the accounting and finance departments hold on tightly to all the information. Are your finance folks stuck in the old approach to their field—keepers and controllers of the numbers, reluctant participants in the communication process? Are they focused on control and compliance? If so, that means you may have a difficult time getting access to data. But you can still use what you learn to talk about the numbers at your management meetings. You can use the tools to help you <span id="page_25">make </span>a decision, or to ask questions about the assumptions and estimates in the numbers. In fact, you’ll probably surprise and maybe delight your accountants and finance people. We love to see it when it happens.</p>
<p class="P41">A third possibility is that your boss doesn’t want you to question the numbers. If that’s the case, he himself may not be comfortable with financials. He probably doesn’t know about the assumptions, estimates, and resulting bias. Your boss is a victim of the numbers! Our advice is to keep going; eventually, bosses usually see the benefit to themselves, their departments, and their companies. You can help them along. The more people who do so, the more financially intelligent the entire organization will be. You can also begin to take some risks. Your financial knowledge will give you newfound power, and you can ask some probing questions.</p>
<p class="P41">A fourth possibility: you don’t have time. Just give us the time it takes you to read this book. If you fly for business, take it with you on a trip or two. In just a few hours, you will become a lot more knowledgeable about finance than you have ever been in the past. Alternatively, keep it someplace handy. The chapters are deliberately short, and you can read one whenever you have a few spare moments. Incidentally, we’ve included some stories about the fancy financial shenanigans pulled by some of the corporate villains in the 1990s and 2000s just to make it a little more entertaining—and to show you how slippery some of these slopes can be. We don’t mean to imply that every company is like them; on the contrary, most are doing their best to present a fair and honest picture of their performance. But it’s always fun to read about the bad guys.</p>
<p class="P41">So don’t let these obstacles get in your way. Read the book, and learn what you can about your own company. Soon you will have a healthy appreciation of the art of finance, and you will increase your financial intelligence. You won’t magically acquire an MBA in finance, but you will be an appreciative consumer of the numbers, someone who’s capable of understanding and assessing what the financial folks are showing you and asking them appropriate questions. The numbers will no longer scare you. It won’t take long, it’s relatively painless, and it will mean a lot to your career.</p>
