<p class="C2084">Want to manage accounts receivable more effectively? DSO is not the only measure to look at. Another is what’s called the <em>aging </em>of receivables. Often, reviewing aging is the key to understanding the true situation in your company’s receivables.</p>
<p class="P41">Here’s why. As we mentioned earlier, DSO is by definition an average. For example, if you have $1 million in receivables that are under ten days and $1 million that are more than ninety days, your overall DSO is about fifty days. That doesn’t sound too bad—but in fact, your company may be in substantial trouble, because half of its customers don’t seem to be paying their bills. Another business of the same size might have a DSO figure of fifty days with only $250,000 over ninety days. That business isn’t in the same sort of trouble.</p>
<p class="P41">An aging analysis will present you with just these kinds of figures: total receivables under thirty days, total for thirty to sixty days, and so on. It’s usually worth checking out that analysis as well as your overall DSO number to get the full picture of your receivables.</p>
