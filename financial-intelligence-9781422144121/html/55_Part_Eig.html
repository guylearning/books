<p class="C2084">If you are anywhere near your finance department, you have heard of Sarbanes-Oxley, also known as Sarbox or just Sox. Sarbanes-Oxley is a law enacted by the US Congress in July 2002 in response to continuing revelations of financial fraud. It may be the most significant legislation affecting corporate governance, financial disclosure, and public accounting since the original US securities laws were enacted in the 1930s. It is designed to improve the public’s confidence in the financial markets by strengthening financial reporting controls and the penalties for noncompliance.</p>
<p class="P41">Sarbanes-Oxley’s provisions affect nearly everyone involved with finance (and most of the operations folks, too). The law created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. It bans accounting firms from selling both audit and nonaudit services to clients. It requires corporate boards of directors to include at least one director who is a financial expert and requires board audit committees to establish procedures whereby employees can confidentially tip off directors to fraudulent accounting. Under Sarbanes-Oxley, a company cannot fire, demote, or harass employees who attempt to report suspected financial fraud.</p>
<p class="P41">CEOs and CFOs are greatly affected by the law. These officers must certify their company’s quarterly and annual financial statements, attest that they are responsible for disclosure and control procedures, and affirm that the financial statements don’t contain misrepresentations. Most companies we work with now have extensive approval and sign-off procedures each quarter. Since the CEO and CFO are on the hook for the financials, they often want every division president to sign for his or her division. Indeed, <span id="page_260">signoffs </span>may extend several levels down. According to the law, fines and jail time may be required if financial results are misrepresented intentionally. Also, the law forbids companies from granting or guaranteeing personal loans to executives and directors. (A study by the nonprofit Corporate Library Research Group found that companies lent executives more than $4.5 billion in 2001, just prior to the law’s enactment, often at no or low interest.) And it requires CEOs or CFOs to give back certain bonuses and stock option profits if their company is forced to restate financial results because of misconduct.</p>
<p class="P41">Sarbanes-Oxley requires companies to strengthen their internal controls. They must include an “internal controls report” in their annual report to shareholders, addressing management’s responsibility in maintaining adequate controls over financial reporting and stating a conclusion as to the effectiveness of the controls. In addition, management must disclose information on material changes in the financial condition or operations of the company on a rapid and current basis.</p>
<p class="P41">Sarbanes-Oxley forces public companies to take more responsibility for their financial statements, and may lessen the probability of undetected fraud. However, it is very expensive to implement. The average cost for companies is $5 million; for large companies such as General Electric, it may be as much as $30 million.</p>
