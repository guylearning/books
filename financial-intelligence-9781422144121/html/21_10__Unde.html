<p class="C2056"><strong>Understanding Balance Sheet Basics</strong></p>
<p class="P68">There’s a puzzling fact about financial statements. Maybe you’ve noticed it.</p>
<p class="P41">Give a company’s financials to an experienced manager in the business, and the first thing he will turn to is the income statement. Most managers have—or aspire to have—“P&amp;L responsibility.” They’re accountable for making the various forms of profit turn out right. They know that the income statement is where their performance is ultimately recorded. So that’s what they look at first.</p>
<p class="P41">Now try giving the same set of financials to a banker, an experienced Wall Street investor, or maybe a veteran board member. The first statement this person will turn to is invariably the balance sheet. In fact, she’s likely to pore over it for some time. Then she’ll start flipping the pages, checking out the income statement and the cash flow statement—but always going back to the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="C1974">Why don’t managers do what the pros do? Why do they limit their attention to the income statement? We chalk it up to three factors:</p>
<p class="C1980">• The balance sheet is a little harder to get your mind around than the income statement. Income statements, after all, are pretty intuitive. The balance sheet isn’t—at least not until you understand the basics.</p>
<p class="C1980"><span id="page_90">• </span>Most companies’ budgeting processes focus on revenue and expenses. In other words, the budget categories more or less align with the income statement. You can’t be a manager without knowing something about budgeting—which automatically means that you’re familiar with many of the lines on the income statement. Balance sheet data, by contrast, rarely figures in an operating manager’s budgeting process (although the finance department certainly budgets the balance sheet accounts).</p>
<p class="C1981">• <em>Managing </em>the balance sheet requires a deeper understanding of finance than managing an income statement. You not only have to know what the various categories refer to, you have to know how they fit together. You also have to understand how changes in the balance sheet affect the other financial statements, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="C2051">Our guess is that you, too, are a bit wary of the balance sheet. But remember: what we’re focusing on here is financial intelligence—understanding how financial results are measured and what you as a manager, an employee, or a leader can do to improve results. We won’t get into the esoteric elements of the balance sheet, just the ones you need to appreciate the art of this statement and do the analyses that the statement makes possible.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>SHOWING WHERE THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">So what is the balance sheet? <em>It’s no more, and no less, than a statement of what a business owns and what it owes at a particular point in time</em>. The difference between what a company owns and what it owes represents <em>equity</em>. Just as one of a company’s goals is to increase profitability, another is to increase equity. And as it happens, the two are intimately related.</p>
<p class="P41">What is this relationship? Consider an analogy. Profitability is sort of like the grade you receive for a course in college. You spend a semester writing papers and taking exams. At the end of the semester, the instructor tallies your performance and gives you an A– or a C+ or whatever. Equity is more like your overall grade point average (GPA). Your GPA always reflects your cumulative performance, but at only one point in time. Any one grade affects it, but doesn’t determine it. The income statement affects the <span id="page_91">balance </span>sheet much the way an individual grade affects your GPA. Make a profit in any given period, and the equity on your balance sheet will show an increase. Lose money, and it will show a decrease. Over time, the equity section of the balance sheet shows the <em>accumulation </em>of profits or losses left in the business; the line is called retained earnings or sometimes accumulated earnings. If the company has built up a net loss over time, then the balance sheet will show a negative number called accumulated deficit in this section of the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Equity</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Equity is the shareholders’ “stake” in the company as measured by accounting rules. It’s also called the company’s book value. In accounting terms, equity is always assets minus liabilities; it is also the sum of all capital paid in by shareholders <em>plus </em>any profits earned by the company since its inception <em>minus </em>dividends paid out to shareholders. That’s the accounting formula, anyway. Remember that what a company’s shares are actually worth is whatever a willing buyer will pay for them.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">Here, too, however, understanding the balance sheet means understanding all the assumptions, decisions, and estimates that go into it. Like the income statement, the balance sheet is in many respects a work of art, not just a work of calculation.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Since the balance sheet is so important, we want to begin with some simple lessons. Bear with us—it’s important in this case to crawl before you walk.</p>
<p class="P41">Start by considering an individual’s financial situation, or financial worth, again at a given point in time. You add up what the person owns, subtract what she owes, and come up with her <em>net worth</em>:</p>
<p class="P97"><img src="../html/images/Image_108_0.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="38"/></p>
<p class="C2084">Another way to state the same thing is this:</p>
<p class="P97"><span id="page_92"><img src="../html/images/Image_109_0.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="39"/></span></p>
<p class="C2051">For an individual, the ownership category might include cash in the bank, big-ticket items like a house and a car, and all the other property the person can lay claim to. It also would include financial assets such as stocks and bonds or a retirement account. The “owing” category includes mortgage, car loan, credit card balances, and any other debt. Note that we’re avoiding for the moment the question of <em>how </em>to calculate some of those numbers. What’s the value of the house—what the person paid for it or what it might bring today? How about the car or the TV? You can see the art of finance peeking around the curtain here—but more on that in a moment.</p>
<p class="C1974">Now move from an individual to a business. Same concepts, different language:</p>
<p class="C1980">• What the company owns is called its <em>assets</em>.</p>
<p class="C1980">• What it owes is called its <em>liabilities</em>.</p>
<p class="C1981">• What it’s worth is called <em>owners’ equity </em>or <em>shareholders’ equity</em>.</p>
<p class="C2084">And the basic equation now looks like this:</p>
<p class="P97"><img src="../html/images/Image_109_1.jpg" alt="" width="319" height="35"/></p>
<p class="C2084">or this:</p>
<p class="P97"><img src="../html/images/Image_109_2.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="34"/></p>
<p class="C2051">The latter formulation is one you might recognize from your Accounting 101 class years ago. It is the classic equation of the balance sheet. The instructor probably called it the <em>fundamental accounting equation</em>. You also learned that it reflects the two sides of the balance sheet: assets on the one side, liabilities and owners’ equity on the other. The sum on one side has to equal the sum on the other side; the balance sheet has to balance. Before you finish this part of the book, you will understand why.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>READING A BALANCE SHEET</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">First, however, find a sample balance sheet, either your own company’s or one in an annual report. (Or just look at the sample in the appendix.) Since <span id="page_93">the </span>balance sheet shows the company’s financial situation at a given point in time, there should be a specific date at the top. It’s usually the end of a month, quarter, year, or fiscal year. When you’re looking at financial statements together, you typically want to see an income statement for a month, quarter, or year, along with the balance sheet for the end of the period reported. Unlike income statements, balance sheets are almost always for an entire organization. Sometimes a large corporation creates subsidiary balance sheets for its operating divisions, but it rarely does so for a single facility. As we’ll see, accounting professionals have to do some estimating on the balance sheet, just the way they do with the income statement. Remember the delivery business we described when we were discussing depreciation in <a href="17_8__Costs.html#page_63">chapter 8</a>? The way you depreciate the truck affects not only the income statement but also the value of assets shown on the balance sheet. It turns out that most of the assumptions and biases in the income statement flow into the balance sheet one way or another.</p>
<p class="P41">Balance sheets come in two typical formats. The traditional model shows assets on the left-hand side of the page and liabilities and owners’ equity on the right-hand side, with liabilities at the top. The less traditional format puts assets on top, liabilities in the middle, and owners’ equity on the bottom. Whatever the format, the “balance” remains the same: assets must equal liabilities plus owners’ equity. (In the nonprofit world, where organizations do not have shareholders, owners’ equity is sometimes called “net assets.”) Often a balance sheet shows comparative figures for, say, December 31 of the most recent year and December 31 of the previous year. Check the column headings to see what points in time are being compared.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Fiscal Year</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">A fiscal year is any twelve-month period that a company uses for accounting purposes. Many companies use the calendar year, but some use other periods (October 1 to September 30, for example). Some retailers use a specific weekend, such as the last Sunday of the year, to mark the end of their fiscal year. You must know the company’s fiscal year to ascertain how recent the information you are looking at is.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C1984"><span id="page_94">As </span>with income statements, some organizations have unusual line items on their balance sheets that you won’t find discussed in this book. Remember, many of these items may be clarified in the footnotes. In fact, balance sheets are notorious for their footnotes. Coca-Cola’s 2010 annual report, for example, contained sixty-one pages of notes, many of them pertaining to the balance sheet. Companies often include a standard disclaimer in the notes making the very point about the art of finance that we are making in this book. Coca-Cola, for instance, says:</p>
<p class="C2115"><em>Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our annual report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best judgments and estimates. Financial information in this annual report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.</em></p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">If the notes don’t provide the necessary enlightenment, you can leave the items to the financial professionals. (If something you’re wondering about is significant, though, it makes sense to ask someone in your finance organization about the item and the number that goes with it.)</p>
<p class="P41">Since the balance sheet is new to most managers, we want to walk you through the most common line items. Some may look strange at first, but don’t worry: just keep in mind that distinction between “owned” and “owed.” As with the income statement, we’ll pause along the way to see which lines are most easily monkeyed with.</p>
