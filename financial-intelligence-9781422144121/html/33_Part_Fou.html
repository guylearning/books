<p class="C1971"><strong><a id="id_192"></a>FREE CASH FLOW</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Several years ago, Wall Street’s favorite measure was EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Banks loved EBITDA because they believed it was a good indication of future cash flow. But then came a double whammy. During the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, companies such as WorldCom turned out to have cooked their books. So their EBITDA figures were not reliable. When the financial crisis hit in 2008, investors and lenders grew even more wary of any metric tied to the income statement. They realized that income statements are loaded with estimates and assumptions, and that profit shown on these statements is not necessarily real.</p>
<p class="P41">So now there’s a hot new metric on Wall Street: free cash flow. Some companies have looked at free cash flow for years. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the best-known example, though Buffett calls it <em>owner earnings</em>.</p>
<p class="P41">You can calculate free cash flow in a couple of different ways, but the most common approach is simple subtraction:</p>
<p class="P97"><img src="../html/images/Image_169_0.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="30"/></p>
<p class="C2051">These figures come directly from the cash flow statement. Operating cash flow (or “cash provided by operating activities”) is the total from the top section of the statement. Net capital expenditures are purchases of property, plant, and equipment—a line item in the investing section of the cash flow statement. We use the term <em>net </em>capital expenditures because many businesses add back any proceeds from sales of capital equipment <span id="page_153">(another </span>line in the investing section). Note that net capital expenditures is almost always a negative number, which may create some confusion. Ignore the minus sign! Just subtract the absolute value of that line from operating cash flow. Using our sample financial statements in the appendix, for example, free cash flow for this company would be $498 (cash from operations) less $205 (the amount invested in property, plant, and equipment), or $293 million.</p>
<p class="P41">Investors have gravitated to this metric because cash is not subject to estimates and assumptions. It’s easy to audit cash balances. Unless the company is simply lying—and this kind of lie is very likely to come out quickly—it really has the cash flow indicated on its statement. Also, whenever capital markets are constrained (as they have often been since 2008), the businesses most able to invest in growth will be those that can generate their own cash.</p>
<p class="P41">From a company’s point of view, a healthy free cash flow gives it some good options. It can expand operations, make acquisitions, pay off debt, buy back its stock, or pay dividends to shareholders. Companies with weak free cash flow have to get outside financing to do any of that. And, of course, the more free cash flow you have, the more favorably Wall Street will view your stock.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong><a id="id_194"></a>EVEN THE BIG GUYS CAN RUN OUT OF CASH</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">While teaching a finance module to executives of a <em>Fortune </em>100 company, we were discussing the importance of cash. An attendee raised her hand to recount a story.</p>
<p class="P41">It was the first quarter of 2009, she said, and the capital markets were in trouble. One of her clients called. The client had a $100 million credit line with the company’s financial division and wanted to draw down the entire amount. She remonstrated, arguing that the client seemed to have plenty of cash on its balance sheet. But the client persisted.</p>
<p class="P41">So the executive contacted her company’s treasury department and requested that the funds be wired to her client’s account. The request was normally a routine exercise for such a large company, but this time the treasury told her that the corporation did not have enough cash to make the transfer. The executive was in shock. “Did I hear you right?” she asked. <span id="page_154">And </span>then she said, “Do you really want me to tell the client that our corporation does not have the cash to meet this committed credit line?” Finally, the treasury representative asked her to contact the CEO’s office for approval and said he and his colleagues would try to find the cash. Which they eventually did.</p>
<p class="P41">How can a big corporation even come close to running out of cash? In fact, the trouble lay behind the scenes. For a week or two in early 2009, the commercial paper window on Wall Street shut down because of all the uncertainty in financial circles. Commercial paper consists of short-term notes or loans to large, stable corporations that typically come due in thirty, sixty, or ninety days. Many large corporations roll over billions of dollars of these low-interest notes to handle their short-term financial needs. This particular company was using many billions of dollars’ worth of commercial paper for that purpose. Every week, several billion in notes would come due, and the company would roll this over into new notes. When the market shut down, the corporation was billions of dollars short and had to scramble to find a way to cover the shortfall.</p>
