<p class="C2056"><strong>Cash Is a Reality Check</strong></p>
<p class="P68">Many managers are too busy worrying about income-statement measures such as EBITDA to give cash much notice. Boards of directors and outside analysts sometimes focus too heavily on the balance sheet. But there is one investor who watches cash closely: Warren Buffett.</p>
<p class="P41">Warren Buffett may be the single greatest investor of all time. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, has invested in scores of companies and achieved astonishing results. From 2006 through 2010, the book value of Berkshire Hathaway—a conservative indicator of its worth—rose at an average annual rate of 10.0 percent, compared with 2.3 percent for the S&amp;P 500, a broad gauge of publicly traded stocks. That continued an exceptional investment performance dating all the way back to 1965. How does Buffett do it? Many people have written books attempting to explain his investing philosophy and analytical approach. But in our opinion it all boils down to just three simple precepts. First, he evaluates a business on its long-term rather than its short-term prospects. Second, he always looks for businesses he understands. (This led him to avoid many Internet-related investments.) And third, when he examines financial statements, he places the greatest emphasis on a measure of cash flow that he calls <em>owner earnings</em>. Warren Buffett has taken financial intelligence to a whole new level, and his net worth reflects it. How interesting that, to him, cash is king.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong><span id="page_126">Owner </span>Earnings</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Owner earnings is a measure of the company’s ability to generate cash over a period of time. We like to say it is the money an owner could take out of his business and spend for his own benefit. Owner earnings is an important measure because it allows for the continuing capital expenditures that will be necessary to maintain a healthy business. Profit and even operating cash flow measures do not. More about owner earnings in the toolbox at the end of this part.</p>
<p class="C2809b">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>WHY CASH IS KING</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Let’s look at that third element of the financial statements—cash—in more detail. Why target cash flow as a key measure of business performance? Why not just profit, as found on the income statement? Why not just a company’s assets or owners’ equity, as revealed by the balance sheet? For one thing, profit is not the same as cash, as we explain in <a href="29_16__Prof.html#page_129">chapter 16</a>. Profit is based on promises, not money coming in. So if you want to know whether your company has cash to pay employees, pay its bills, and even invest in equipment, you need to study cash flow.</p>
<p class="P41">Then, too, the income statement and balance sheet, however useful, have all sorts of potential biases, a result of the assumptions and estimates that are built into them. Cash is different. Look at a company’s cash flow statement, and you are indirectly peering into its bank account. Today, after all the financial turmoil of the past fifteen years, cash flow is the darling of Wall Street. It has become a prominent measure by which analysts evaluate companies. But Warren Buffett has been looking at cash all along because he knows that it’s the number least affected by the art of finance.</p>
<p class="P41">Why do some managers fail to pay attention to cash? There are any number of reasons. In the past, nobody asked them to (though this is beginning to change). Folks in the finance organization often believe that cash is <em>their </em>concern and nobody else’s. But often, the reason is simply a lack of financial intelligence. Managers don’t understand the accounting rules that determine profit, so they assume that profit is pretty much the same as net cash coming in. Some don’t believe that their actions affect <span id="page_127">their </span>company’s cash situation; others may believe it, but they don’t understand how.</p>
<p class="P41">There’s another reason, too, which is that the language on the cash flow statement is a little arcane. Most cash flow statements are hard for a nonfinancial person to read, let alone understand. But talk about an investment that pays off: if you take the time to understand cash, you can cut right through a lot of the smoke and mirrors created by your company’s financial artists. You can see how good a job your company is doing at turning profit into cash. You can spot early warning signs of trouble, and you will know how to manage so that cash flow is healthy. Cash is a reality check.</p>
<p class="P41">One of us, Joe, learned about the importance of cash when he was a financial analyst at a small company early in his career. The company was struggling, and everyone knew it. One day the CFO and the controller were both out golfing and were unreachable. (This was in the days before everybody had a cell phone, which shows you how old Joe is.) The banker called the office and talked with the CEO. Evidently, the CEO didn’t like what he was hearing from the banker and felt he had better talk to someone in accounting or finance. So he passed the call to Joe. Joe learned from the banker that the company’s credit line was maxed out. “Given that tomorrow is payday,” the banker said, “we’re curious about what your plan is to cover payroll.” Thinking quickly (as always), Joe replied, “Um—can I call you back?” He then did some research and found that a big customer owed the company a good deal of money and that the check—really—was in the mail. He told the banker this, and the banker agreed to cover payroll, provided Joe brought the customer’s check to the bank the minute it arrived.</p>
<p class="P41">In fact, the check arrived that same day, but after the bank closed. So first thing the next morning, Joe drove to the bank, check in hand. He arrived a few minutes before the bank opened, and noticed that a line had already formed. In fact, he saw that several employees from his company were already there, holding their paychecks. One of them accosted him and said, “So you figured it out too, huh?” “Figured what out?” Joe asked. The guy looked at him with something resembling pity. “Figured <em>it </em>out. We’ve been taking our paychecks to the bank every Friday first break we got. We cash ’em and then deposit the cash in our own banks. That way, we can make sure the checks don’t bounce—and if the bank won’t cash them, we can spend the rest of the day looking for a job.”</p>
<p class="P41"><span id="page_128">That </span>was one day Joe’s financial intelligence took a big leap upward. He realized what Warren Buffett already knew: it’s cash that keeps a company alive, and cash flow is a critical measure of its financial health. You need people to run the business—any business. You need a place of business, telephones, electricity, computers, supplies, and so on. And you can’t pay for all these things with profits, because profits aren’t real money. Cash is.</p>
