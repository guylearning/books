<p class="C2034">We—Karen and Joe—have been working together for more than twelve years. Our partnership began with a chance meeting at a conference and evolved over time into co-ownership of our company, the Business Literacy Institute, and now into coauthorship of this book. Over the years, we have met, worked with, and shared experiences with many people who have had an impact on our thinking and our work. This book is a culmination of our education, of our work and management experiences, of our research, of our partnership, and of all we have learned from our work with thousands of employees, managers, and leaders.</p>
<p class="C2013">Karen first met John while conducting research for her dissertation. He was, and still is, one of the preeminent experts on open-book management and a highly respected business author. We kept track of each other through the years and were always interested in each other’s work. Karen was delighted when John wanted to be a part of this project. He has been an indispensable part of the team.</p>
<p class="C2014">Many other people have helped make this book a reality. Among them:</p>
<p class="C1980">• The readers of the first edition of <em>Financial Intelligence</em>. We knew when we wrote the first book that there was a need for a down-to-earth, real-world book about finance. But we had no idea we were writing a best-seller! This second edition is available in part because so many of these readers recommended the book, shared it, and bought it for people they knew would benefit from it.</p>
<p class="C1980">• Bo Burlingham, an editor-at-large at <em>Inc</em>. magazine, author of the wonderful book <em>Small Giants</em>, and coauthor (with Jack Stack) of <em>The Great Game of Business </em>and <em>A Stake in the Outcome</em>. Bo graciously shared with us the research and writing on financial fraud that he and Joe had gathered for another project.</p>
<p class="C1980">• Joe Cornwell and Joe VanDenBerghe, founders of Setpoint (at Setpoint they were referred to simply as “the Joes”). We’re grateful for their belief in teaching everyone the financials and for their tireless efforts in encouraging everyone at Setpoint to participate actively in the success of the company. We <span id="page_268">also </span>want to thank Setpoint’s current CEO, Brad Angus, who has been extremely helpful as an adviser to this second edition. We’re glad they let us tell some Setpoint stories. We also want to acknowledge Reid Leland (owner of LeanWerks), Mark Coy, Machel Jackson, Jason Munns, Steve Neutzman, Kara Smith, Roger Thomas, and all the Setpoint employees for helping us refine our approach to financial intelligence. If you are ever in Utah, you should visit Setpoint; the company’s system works, and you’ll see both financial intelligence and psychic ownership in action. We suspect you’ll be surprised at employees’ depth of understanding of the business and their commitment to its success.</p>
<p class="C1980">• Our clients at the Business Literacy Institute. Thanks to their commitment to financial literacy, we have been able to help spread financial intelligence throughout many organizations. It’s impossible to thank them all, but a few who cheered us on during the writing of this second edition are Heidi Flaherty and the team at Advent; the Association of General Contractors; Cheryl Mackie at CVS Caremark; Andy Billings at Electronic Arts; Jeff Detrick, Michael Guarnieri, Ellie Murphy, and the entire team at General Electric; Valorie McClelland and Ginny Hoverman at Goodrich; Jim Roberts, Tom Case, Ron Gatto, Catherine Hambley and the team at Granite Construction; Tiffany Keller at Gulfstream, Tanya Chermack at Harvard Vanguard; the Independent College Bookstore Association; Becky Nawrocki at the Institute of Supply Management; Gayle Tomlinson at Kraton; Michael Sigmund at MacDermid Incorporated; Michelle Duke and Anne Frenette at the National Association of Broadcasters; Steve Capas, David Pietrycha, Christy Shibata, Mary von Herrmann, and the teams at NBC News and NBC Universal; Manu Varma at Sierra Wireless; the Society of Human Resource Management; Meghan O’Leary and Stacy Pell at Silicon Valley Bank; Beth Goldstein at Smile Brands; Melinda Del Toro and Ron Wangerin at Viasat; and Mariela Saravia at Visa.</p>
<p class="C1980">• Our colleagues at the Business Literacy Institute. Our facilitation team—Jim Bado, Cathy Ivancic, Hovig Tchalian, and Ed Westfield—are all top-notch trainers, with their own unique styles that make taking a class from them an enriching experience. Stephanie Wexler is manager of client services; her professionalism keeps our projects on track. Judy Golove, manager of training development, ensures that all our training programs are of the highest quality. Kara Smith also works in training development, joining Judy in keeping our programs top notch. Sharon Maas’s extensive knowledge of business literacy is reflected in our customized training program content. Brad Angus, our business development manager, works tirelessly to ensure we are meeting our clients’ needs. Kathy Hoye is the team’s administrative assistant, keeping everything running smoothly.</p>
<p class="C1980"><span id="page_269">• </span>Dave Merrill, the creative artist who illustrates our Money Maps. His ability to take our initial rough ideas and bring them to life is a true talent.</p>
<p class="C1980">• Jonathan Troper and the team at Alliant International University’s Marshall Goldsmith School of Management, who worked with us to conduct the national study in which we assessed the financial intelligence of US managers and leaders. We relied on their expertise to ensure that the financial intelligence test itself and our approach were statistically valid and reliable, giving us accurate data about where US managers and leaders stand in terms of their financial intelligence.</p>
<p class="C1980">• Our agent, James Levine.</p>
<p class="C1980">• Tim Sullivan, our editor; and the rest of the team at Harvard Business Review Press, with a special thank you to Julie Devoll.</p>
<p class="C1980">• And all the others who have helped us along the way, including Helen and Gene Berman, Tony Bonenfant, Kelin Gersick, Larry and Jewel Knight, Nellie Lal, Michael Lee and the Main Graphics team, Don Mankin, Philomena McAndrew, Alen Miller, Loren Roberts, Marlin Shelley, Brian Shore, Roberta Wolff, Paige Woodward, Joanne Worrell, and Brian Zander. Our heartfelt thanks to all.</p>
