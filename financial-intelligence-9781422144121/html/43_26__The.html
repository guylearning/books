<p class="C2056"><strong>The Building Blocks of ROI</strong></p>
<p class="P68">Financial intelligence is all about understanding how the financial side of business works and how financial decisions are made. The principles discussed in this chapter are the foundation of how some decisions—those relating to capital investment—are made in corporate America.</p>
<p class="P41">Most of us need little introduction to the fundamental principle of finance known as the <em>time value of money</em>. The reason is that we take advantage of it every day in our personal finances. We take out home mortgages and car loans. We run up balances on our credit cards. Meanwhile, we’re putting our own savings into interest-bearing checking or savings accounts, money-market funds, treasury bills, stocks and I bonds, and probably half a dozen other kinds of investments. The United States in particular is a nation of borrowers—in fact, the US government borrowed so much that its debt was downgraded in 2011—but it is also a nation of savers, lenders, and investors. Since all these activities reflect the time value of money, it’s a safe bet that most of us have a gut-level understanding of the idea. Those who don’t are likely to wind up on the losing end of the principle, which can be expensive indeed.</p>
<p class="P41">At its simplest, the principle of the time value of money says this: a dollar in your hand today is worth more than a dollar you expect to collect tomorrow—and it’s worth a whole lot more than a dollar you hope to collect ten years from now. The reasons are obvious. You know you have <span id="page_198">today’s </span>dollar, whereas a dollar you expect to get tomorrow (let alone in ten years) is a little iffy. There’s risk involved. What’s more, you can buy something today with the dollar you have. If you want to spend the dollar you hope to have, you have to wait until you have it. Given the time value of money, anyone who lends money to somebody else expects to be paid interest, and anybody who borrows money expects to pay interest. The longer the time period and the higher the risk, the larger the interest charges are likely to be.</p>
<p class="P41">The principle here is the same, of course, even if <em>interest </em>isn’t the term used and even if there is no fixed expectation about what the return will be. Say you buy stock in a high-tech start-up. You’re not going to get any interest, and you probably will never receive a dividend—but you hope you can sell the stock for more than you paid for it. In effect, you’re lending the company your money with the expectation of a return on your investment. When and if the return materializes, you can calculate it in percentage terms just as if it were really interest.</p>
<p class="P41">This is the basic principle that underlies a business’s decisions about capital investments, which we will discuss in this part. The business has to spend cash that it has now in hopes of realizing a return at some future date. If you are charged with preparing a financial proposal for buying a new machine or opening a new branch office—tasks that we’ll show you how to do in the following pages—you will be relying on calculations involving the time value of money.</p>
<p class="P41">While the time value of money is the basic principle, the three key concepts you’ll be using in analyzing capital expenditures are <em>future value</em>, <em>present value</em>, and <em>required rate of return</em>. You may find them confusing at first, but none of them is too complicated. They’re simply ways to calculate the time value of money. If you can understand these concepts and use them in your decision making, you’ll find yourself thinking more creatively—maybe we should say more artistically—about financial matters, just the way the pros do.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>FUTURE VALUE</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Future value is what a given amount of cash will be worth in the future if it is loaned out or invested. In personal finance, it’s a concept often used in <span id="page_199">retirement </span>planning. Perhaps you have $50,000 in the bank at age thirty-five, and you want to know what that $50,000 will be worth at age sixty-five. That’s the future value of the $50,000. In business, an investment analyst might project the value of a company’s stock in two years if earnings grow at some given percent a year. That future-value calculation can help her advise clients as to whether the company is a good investment.</p>
<p class="P41">Figuring future value offers a broad canvas for financial artists. Look at that retirement plan, for example. Do you assume an average 3 percent return over the next thirty years, or do you assume an average 6 percent? The difference is substantial: at 3 percent your $50,000 will grow to slightly more than $121,000 (and never mind what inflation will have done to the value of a dollar in the meantime). At 6 percent it will grow to more than $287,000, though with the same caveat about the effect of inflation. It’s tough to decide the right interest rate to use: how on earth can anyone know what interest rates will prevail over the next thirty years? At best, calculating future value that far out is educated guesswork—an exercise in artistry.</p>
<p class="P41">The investment analyst is in a somewhat better position, because she is looking out only two years. Still, she has more variables to contend with. <em>Why </em>does she think earnings might grow at 3 percent or 5 percent or 7 percent or some other rate entirely? And what happens if they do? If earnings grow at only 3 percent, for instance, investors might lose interest and sell their shares, and the stock’s price-to-earnings ratio might decline. If earnings grow at 7 percent, investors might get excited, buy more stock, and push up that ratio. And of course, the market itself will have an effect on the stock’s price, and nobody can reliably predict the market’s overall direction. Again, we’re back to educated guesswork.</p>
<p class="P41">In fact, every calculation of future value involves a series of assumptions about what will happen between now and the time that you’re looking at. Change the assumptions, and you get a different future value. The variance in return rates is a form of financial risk. The longer the investment outlook, the more estimating is required, hence the higher the risk.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>PRESENT VALUE</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">This is the concept used most often in analyzing capital expenditures. It’s the reverse of future value. Say you believe that a particular investment <span id="page_200">will </span>generate $100,000 in cash flow per year over the next three years. If you want to know whether the investment is worth spending money on, you need to know what that $300,000 would be worth right now. Just as you use a particular interest rate to figure future value, you also use an interest rate to “discount” a future value and bring it back to present value. To take a simple example, the present value of $106,000 one year from now at 6 percent interest is $100,000. We are back to the notion that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. In this example, $106,000 in twelve months is worth $100,000 today.</p>
<p class="P41">Present-value concepts are widely used to evaluate investments in equipment, real estate, business opportunities, even mergers and acquisitions. But you can see the art of finance clearly here as well. To figure present value, you have to make assumptions <em>both </em>about the cash the investment will generate in the future <em>and </em>about what kind of an interest rate should be used to discount that future value.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>REQUIRED RATE OF RETURN</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">When you’re figuring what interest rate to use in calculating present value, remember that you’re working backward. You are assuming your investment will pay off a certain amount in the future, and you want to know how much is worth investing now in order to get that amount at a future date. So your decision about the interest or discount rate is essentially a decision about what interest rate you <em>need </em>in order to make the investment at all. You might not invest $100,000 now to get $102,000 in a year—a 2 percent rate—but you might very well invest $100,000 now to get $120,000 in a year—a 20 percent rate. Different companies set the bar, or “hurdle,” at different points, and they typically set it higher for riskier projects than for less risky ones. The rate that they require before they will make an investment is called the <em>required rate of return</em>, or the “hurdle rate.”</p>
<p class="P41">There is always some judgment involved in establishing a hurdle rate, but the judgment isn’t wholly arbitrary. One factor is the <em>opportunity cost </em>involved. The company has only so much cash, and it has to make judgments about how best to use its funds. That 2 percent return is unattractive because the company could probably do better just by buying a treasury bill, which might pay 3 percent or 4 percent with almost no risk. The <span id="page_201">20 </span>percent return may well be attractive—it’s hard to make 20 percent on most investments—but it obviously depends on how risky the venture is. A second factor is the company’s own <em>cost of capital</em>. If it borrows money, it has to pay interest. If it uses shareholders’ capital, the shareholders expect a return. The proposed investment has to add enough value to the company that debtholders can be repaid and shareholders kept happy. An investment that returns less than the company’s cost of capital won’t meet these two objectives—so the required rate of return should always be higher than the cost of capital. (See the toolbox at the end of this part for a detailed discussion of cost of capital.)</p>
<p class="P41">That said, decisions about hurdle rates are rarely a matter of following a formula. The company’s CFO or treasurer will evaluate how risky a given investment is, how it is likely to be financed, and what the company’s overall situation is. He knows that shareholders expect the company to invest for the future. He knows, too, that shareholders expect those investments to generate a return at least comparable to what they can get elsewhere at a similar level of risk. He knows—or at least you hope he does—how tight the company’s cash position is, how much risk the CEO and the board are comfortable with, and what’s going on in the marketplace the company operates in. Then he makes judgments—assumptions—about what kind of hurdle rates make sense. High-growth companies typically use a high hurdle rate, because they must invest their money where they think it will generate the level of growth they need. More stable, low-growth companies typically use a lower hurdle rate. If you don’t already know it, someone in your finance organization can tell you what hurdle rate your company uses for the kind of projects you’re likely to be involved in.</p>

<p class="C2809"><strong>Opportunity Cost</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">In everyday language, this phrase denotes what you had to give up to follow a certain course of action. If you spend all your money on a fancy vacation, the opportunity cost is that you can’t buy a car. In business, opportunity cost often means the potential benefit forgone from not following the financially optimal course of action.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051"><span id="page_202">A </span>word on the calculations involving these concepts. In <a href="44_27__Figu.html#page_203">chapter 27</a>, we’ll show you a formula or two. But you don’t need to work it all out by hand; you can use a financial calculator, find a book of tables, or just go online. For instance, type “future value calculator” into Google, and you’ll get several sites where you can figure simple future values. To be sure, real-world calculations aren’t always so easy. Maybe you think the investment you’re considering will generate $100,000 in cash in the first year and 3 percent more in each of the subsequent years. Now you have to figure the increase, make assumptions about whether the appropriate discount rate should change from one year to the next, and so forth. Nonfinancial managers generally don’t have to worry about actually doing these more complex calculations; the finance folks will do them for you. Usually, they’ll have a spreadsheet or template with the appropriate formulas embedded, so that you or they can just plug in the numbers. But you do have to be aware of the concepts and assumptions that they’ll use in the process. If you’re just plugging in numbers without understanding the logic, you won’t understand why the results turn out as they do, and you won’t know how to make them turn out differently by starting with different assumptions.</p>
<p class="P41">Now let’s put these concepts to work.</p>
