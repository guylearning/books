<p class="C2056"><strong>Your Balance Sheet Levers</strong></p>
<p class="P68">Most companies use their cash to finance customers’ purchase of products or services. That’s the “accounts receivable” line on the balance sheet—the amount of money customers owe at a given point in time, based on the value of what they have purchased before that date.</p>
<p class="P41">The key ratio that measures accounts receivable, as we saw in <a href="34_PART_FIV.html#page_155">part 5</a>, is days sales outstanding, or DSO—that is, the average number of days it takes to collect on these receivables. <em>The longer a company’s DSO, the more working capital is required to run the business</em>. Customers have more of its cash in the form of products or services not yet paid for, so that cash isn’t available to buy inventory, deliver more services, and so on. Conversely, the shorter a company’s DSO, the less working capital is required to run the business. It follows that the more people who understand DSO and work to bring it down, the more free cash the company will have at its disposal.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>MANAGING DSO</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">The first step in managing DSO is to understand what it is and in which direction it has been heading. If it’s higher than it ought to be, and particularly if it’s trending upward (which it nearly always seems to be), managers need to begin asking questions.</p>
<p class="P41"><em><span id="page_230">Operations </span></em>and <em>R&amp;D </em>managers, for example, must ask themselves whether there are any problems with the products that might make customers less willing to pay their bills. Is the company selling what customers want and expect? Is there a problem with delivery? Quality problems and late deliveries often provoke late payment, just because customers are not pleased with the products they’re receiving and decide that they will take their own sweet time about payment. Managers in quality assurance, market research, product development, and so on thus have an effect on receivables, as do managers in production and shipping. In a service company, people who are out delivering the service need to ask themselves the same questions. If service customers aren’t satisfied with what they’re getting, they too will take their time about paying.</p>
<p class="P41"><em>Customer-facing </em>managers—those in sales and customer service—have to ask a similar set of questions. Are our customers healthy? What is the standard in their industry for paying bills? Are they in a region of the world that pays fast or slow? Salespeople typically have the first contact with a customer, so it is up to them to flag any concerns about the customer’s financial health. Once the sale is made, customer-service reps need to pick up the ball and learn what’s going on. What’s happening at the customer’s shop? Are they working overtime? Laying people off? Meanwhile, salespeople need to work with the folks in credit and customer service so that everybody understands the terms up front and will notice when a customer is late. At one company we worked with, the delivery people knew the most about customers’ situations because they were at their facilities every day. They would alert sales and accounting if there seemed to be issues cropping up in a customer’s business.</p>
<p class="P41"><em>Credit </em>managers need to ask whether the terms offered are good for the company and whether they fit the credit histories of the customers. They need to make judgments about whether the company is giving credit too easily or whether it is too tough in its credit policies. There’s always a trade-off between increasing sales on the one hand and issuing credit to poorer credit risks on the other. Credit managers need to set the precise terms they’re willing to offer. Is net thirty days satisfactory—or should we allow net sixty? They need to determine strategies such as offering discounts for early pay. For example, “2/10 net 30” means that customers get a discount of 2 percent if they pay their bill in ten days and no discount if they <span id="page_231">wait </span>thirty days. Sometimes a 1 or 2 percent discount can help a struggling company collect its receivables and thereby lower its DSO—but of course it does so by eating into profitability.</p>
<p class="C1974">We know of a small company that has a simple, homegrown approach to the issue of giving credit to customers. The company has identified the traits it wants in its customers, and has even named its ideal customer “Bob.” Bob’s qualities include the following:</p>
<p class="C1980">• He works for a large company.</p>
<p class="C1980">• His company is known for paying its bills on time.</p>
<p class="C1980">• He can maintain and understand the product provided (this company makes complex, technology-intensive products).</p>
<p class="C1981">• He is looking for an ongoing relationship.</p>
<p class="C2051">If a new customer meets these criteria, his company will get credit from this small manufacturer. Otherwise it won’t. As a result of this policy, the company has been able to keep its DSO quite low and to grow without additional equity investment.</p>
<p class="P41">All these decisions greatly affect accounts receivable and thus working capital. And the fact is, they can have a huge impact. Reducing DSO even by one day can save a large company millions of dollars per day. For example, check back to the DSO calculation in <a href="39_24__Effi.html#page_179">chapter 24</a>, and you’ll note that one day of sales in our sample company is just over $24 million. Reducing DSO from fifty-five days to fifty-four in this company would thus increase cash by $24 million. That’s cash that can be used for other things in the business.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>MANAGING INVENTORY</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Many managers (and consultants!) these days are focusing on inventory. They work to reduce inventory wherever possible. They use buzzwords such as <em>lean manufacturing</em>, <em>just-in-time inventory management</em>, and <em>economic order quantity </em>(EOQ). The reason for all this attention is exactly what we’re talking about here. Managing inventory efficiently reduces working capital requirements by freeing up large amounts of cash.</p>
<p class="P41"><span id="page_232">The </span>challenge for inventory management, of course, isn’t to reduce inventory to zero, which would probably leave a lot of customers unsatisfied. The challenge is to reduce it to a minimum level while still ensuring that every raw material and every part will be available when needed and every product will be ready for sale when a customer wants it. A manufacturer needs to be constantly ordering raw material, making things, and holding them for delivery to customers. Wholesalers and retailers need to replenish their stocks regularly, and avoid the dreaded “stockout”—an item that isn’t available when a customer wants it. Yet every item in inventory ties up cash, which means that the cash cannot be used for other purposes. Exactly how much inventory is required to satisfy customers while minimizing that tied-up cash, well, that’s the million-dollar question (and the reason for all those consultants).</p>
<p class="C1974">The techniques for managing inventory are beyond the scope of this book. But we do want to emphasize that many different kinds of managers affect a company’s use of inventory—which means that all these managers can have an impact on reducing working capital requirements. For example:</p>
<p class="C1980">• <em>Salespeople </em>love to tell customers they can have exactly what they want. (“Have it <em>your </em>way,” as the old Burger King jingle put it.) Custom paint job? No problem. Bells and whistles? No problem. But every variation requires a little more inventory, meaning a little more cash. Obviously, customers must be satisfied. But that commonsense requirement has to be balanced against the fact that inventory costs money. The more that salespeople can sell standard products with limited variations, the less inventory their company will have to carry.</p>
<p class="C1980">• <em>Engineers </em>love those same bells and whistles. In fact, they’re constantly working to improve the company’s products, replacing version 2.54 with version 2.55, and so on. Again, this is a laudable business objective, but one that has to be balanced against inventory requirements. A proliferation of product versions puts a burden on inventory management. When a product line is kept simple, with a few easily interchangeable options, inventory declines and inventory management becomes a less taxing task.</p>
<p class="C1981"><span id="page_233">• </span><em>Production departments </em>greatly affect inventory. For instance, what’s the percentage of machine downtime? Frequent breakdowns require the company to carry more work-in-process inventory and more finished-goods inventory. And what’s the average time between changeovers? Decisions about how much to build of a particular part have an enormous impact on inventory requirements. Even the layout of a plant affects inventory: an efficiently designed production flow in an efficient plant minimizes the need for inventory.</p>
<p class="C2051">Along these lines, it’s worth noting that many US plants operate on a principle that eats up tremendous amounts of working capital. When business is slow, they nevertheless keep on churning out product in order to maintain factory efficiency. Plant managers focus on keeping unit costs down, often because that goal has been pounded into their heads for so long that they no longer question it. They have been trained to do it, told to do it, and paid (with bonuses) for achieving it.</p>
<p class="P41">When business is good, the goal makes perfect sense: keeping unit costs down is simply a way of managing all the costs of production in an efficient manner. (This is the old approach of focusing only on the income statement, which is fine as far as it goes.) When demand is slow, however, the plant manager must consider the company’s cash as well as its unit costs. A plant that continues to turn out product in these circumstances is just creating more inventory that will sit on a shelf taking up space. Coming to work and reading a book might be better than building product that is not ready to be sold.</p>
<p class="P41">How much can a company save through astute inventory management? Look again at our sample company: cutting <em>just one day </em>out of the DII number—reducing it from seventy-four days to seventy-three—would increase cash by nearly $19 million. Any large company can save millions of dollars of cash, and thereby reduce working capital requirements—just by making modest improvements in its inventory management.</p>
