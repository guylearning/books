<p class="C2056"><strong>Assets</strong></p>
<p class="C2264"><strong>More Estimates and Assumptions (Except for Cash)</strong></p>
<p class="P68">Assets are what the company owns: cash and securities, machinery and equipment, buildings and land, whatever. <em>Current assets</em>, which usually come first on the balance sheet in the United States, include anything that can be turned into cash in less than a year. <em>Long-term </em>assets include physical assets that have a useful life of more than a year—usually anything that is either depreciated or amortized. They can also include land, goodwill, and long-term investments, none of which are depreciated.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>TYPES OF ASSETS</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Within those broad categories, of course, are many line items. We’ll list the most common ones—those that appear on nearly every company’s balance sheet.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">This is the hard stuff. Money in the bank. Money in money-market accounts. Also publicly traded stocks and bonds—the kind you can turn into cash in a day or less if you need to. Another name for this category is <em>liquid assets</em>. This is one of the few line items that are not subject to accountants’ <span id="page_96">discretion. </span>When Microsoft says it has $56 billion in cash and short-term investments, or whatever the latest number is, it means it really has that much in banks, money funds, and publicly traded securities. Of course, companies can lie. In 2003, the giant Italian company Parmalat reported on its balance sheet that it had billions in an account with Bank of America. It didn’t. In 2009, the CEO of a large Indian outsourcing company, Satyam Computer Services, acknowledged that he had “inflated the amount of cash on the balance sheet . . . by nearly $1 billion.”<sup><a id="id_156" href="57_Notes.html#id_290">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Accounts Receivable, or A/R</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">This is the amount customers owe the company. Remember, revenue is a promise to pay, so accounts receivable includes all the promises that haven’t yet been collected. Why is this an asset? Because all or most of these commitments will convert to cash and soon <em>will </em>belong to the company. It’s like a loan from the company to its customers—and the company owns the customers’ obligation. Accounts receivable is one line item that managers need to watch closely, particularly since investors, analysts, and creditors are likely to be watching it as well. We’ll say more on how to manage accounts receivable in <a href="46_PART_SEV.html#page_223">part 7</a>, where we discuss working capital.</p>
<p class="P41">Sometimes a balance sheet includes an item labeled “allowance for bad debt” that is subtracted from accounts receivable. This is the accountants’ estimate—usually based on past experience—of the dollars owed by customers who don’t pay their bills. In many companies, subtracting a bad-debt allowance provides a more accurate reflection of the value of those accounts receivable. But note well: estimates are already creeping in. In fact, <span id="page_97">many </span>companies use the bad-debt reserve as a tool to “smooth” their earnings. When you increase the bad-debt reserve on the balance sheet, you have to record an expense against profit on the income statement. That lowers your reported earnings. When you <em>decrease </em>a reserve for bad debt, similarly, the adjustment increases profit on the income statement. Since the bad-debt reserve is always an estimate, there is room here for subjectivity.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>“Smoothing” Earnings</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">You might think that Wall Street would like a big spike in a company’s profits—more money for shareholders, right? But if the spike is unforeseen and unexplained—and especially if it catches Wall Street by surprise—investors are likely to react negatively, taking it as a sign that management isn’t in control of the business. So companies like to “smooth” their earnings, maintaining steady and predictable growth.</p>
<p class="C2809b">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Inventory</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Service companies typically don’t have much in the way of inventory, but nearly every other company—manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers—does. One part of the inventory figure is the value of the products that are ready to be sold. That’s called <em>finished goods </em>inventory. A second part, usually relevant only to manufacturers, is the value of products that are under construction. Accountants dub that <em>work-in-process </em>inventory, or just WIP (pronounced <em>whip</em>). Then, of course, there’s the inventory of raw materials that will be used to make products. That’s called—stand back—<em>raw materials </em>inventory.</p>
<p class="C1974">Accountants can (and do!) spend days on end talking about ways of valuing inventory. We plan to spend no time at all, because it doesn’t really affect most managers’ jobs. (If your job is inventory management, of course, the accountants’ discussion affects you greatly—and you should find a book on the topic.) However, different methods of inventory valuation can often alter the assets side of a balance sheet significantly. If the company changes its method of valuing inventory during a given year, that fact should appear in a footnote to the balance sheet. Many companies detail how they accounted for their inventories in the footnotes, as Barnes &amp; Noble did in one recent annual report:</p>
<p class="C2115"><em>Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined primarily by the retail inventory method under both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company uses the retail inventory method for 97% of the Company’s merchandise inventories. As of April 30, 2011, and May 1, 2010, 87% of the Company’s inventory on the retail inventory method was valued under the FIFO basis. B&amp;N College’s textbook and trade book inventories are valued using the LIFO method, where the related reserve was not <span id="page_98">material </span>to the recorded amount of the Company’s inventories or results of operations.</em></p>
<p class="C2051">What you do need to remember as a manager, however, is that <em>all </em>inventory costs money. It is created at the expense of cash. (Maybe you’ve heard the expression “All our cash is tied up in inventory,” though we hope you don’t hear it too often.) In fact, this is one way companies can improve their cash position. Decrease your inventory, other things being equal, and you raise your company’s cash level. A company always wants to carry as little inventory as possible, provided that it still has materials ready for its manufacturing processes and products ready when customers come calling. We’ll come back to this topic later in the book.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE)</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">This line on the balance sheet includes buildings, machinery, trucks, computers, and every other physical asset a company owns. The PPE figure is the total number of dollars it cost to buy all the facilities and equipment the company uses to operate the business. Note that the relevant cost here is the <em>purchase price</em>. Without constant appraisals, nobody really knows how much a company’s real estate or equipment might be worth on the open market. So accountants, governed by the principle of conservatism, say in effect, “Let’s use what we do know, which is the cost of acquiring those assets.”</p>
<p class="P41">Another reason for using purchase price is to avoid more opportunities to bias the numbers. Suppose an asset—land, for example—has actually increased in value. If we wanted to “mark it up” on the balance sheet to its current value, we would have to record a profit on the income statement. But that profit would be based simply on someone’s opinion as to what the land was worth today. This is not a good idea. Some companies go so far as to set up corporate shells, often owned by a company executive or other insider, and then sell assets to those shells. That allows them to record a profit, just the way they would if they were selling off assets. But it is not the kind of profit an investor or the Securities and Exchange Commission likes to see.</p>
<p class="P41">Later in this chapter we will discuss <em>mark-to-market </em>accounting, which requires companies to value certain kinds of assets at their current market value. For the moment, just remember that the basis for valuing most <span id="page_99">assets </span>is their purchase price. Of course, the fact that companies rely on purchase price to value their assets can create some striking anomalies. Maybe you work for an entertainment company that bought land around Los Angeles for $500,000 thirty years ago. The land could be worth $5 million today—but it will still be valued at $500,000 on the balance sheet. Sophisticated investors like to nose around in companies’ balance sheets in hopes of finding such undervalued assets.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Less: Accumulated Depreciation</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Land doesn’t wear out, so accountants don’t record any depreciation each year. But buildings and equipment do. The point of accounting depreciation, however, isn’t to estimate what the buildings and equipment are worth right now; the point is to allocate the investment in the asset over the time it is used to generate revenue and profit (remember the matching principle discussed in <a href="14_5__Profi.html#page_43">chapter 5</a>). The depreciation charge is a way of ensuring that the income statement accurately reflects the true cost of producing goods or delivering services. To calculate <em>accumulated </em>depreciation, accountants simply add up all the charges for depreciation they have taken since the day an asset was bought.</p>
<p class="P41">We showed you in <a href="17_8__Costs.html#page_63">chapter 8 </a>how a company can “magically” go from unprofitable to profitable just by changing the way it depreciates its assets. That art-of-finance magic extends to the balance sheet as well. If a company decides its trucks can last six years rather than three, it will record a 50 percent smaller charge on its income statement year after year. That means less accumulated depreciation on the balance sheet, a higher figure for net PPE, and thus more assets. More assets, by the fundamental accounting equation, translates into more owners’ equity in the form of retained earnings.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Goodwill</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Goodwill is found on the balance sheets of companies that have acquired other companies. It’s the difference between what a company paid for another company and what the physical assets of the acquired company are worth.</p>
<p class="P41">OK, that was a mouthful. But it isn’t as complex as it sounds. Say you’re the CEO of a company that is out shopping, and you spot a nice little <span id="page_100">warehousing </span>business called MJQ Storage that fits your needs perfectly. You agree to buy MJQ for $5 million. By the rules of accounting, if you pay cash, the asset called cash on your balance sheet will decrease by $5 million. That means other assets have to rise by $5 million. After all, the balance sheet still has to balance. And you haven’t done anything so far that would change liabilities or owners’ equity.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Acquisitions</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">An acquisition occurs when one company buys another. Often you’ll see in the newspaper the words <em>merger </em>or <em>consolidation</em>. Don’t be fooled: one company still bought the other. They just use a more neutral-sounding term to make the deal look better.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">Now, watch closely. Since you are buying a collection of physical assets (among other things), you will appraise those assets the way any buyer would. Maybe you find that MJQ’s buildings, shelving, forklifts, and computers are worth $2 million. That doesn’t mean you made a bad deal. You are buying a going concern with a name, talented and knowledgeable employees, and so on, and these so-called intangibles can in some cases be much <em>more </em>valuable than the tangible assets. (How much would you pay for the brand name Coca-Cola? Or for Dell Computer’s customer list?) In our example, you’re buying $3 million worth of intangibles. Accountants <span id="page_101">call </span>that $3 million “goodwill.” The $3 million of goodwill and the $2 million of physical assets add up to the $5 million you paid and the corresponding $5 million increase in assets on the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Intangibles</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">A company’s intangible assets include anything that has value but that you can’t touch or spend: employees’ skills, customer lists, proprietary knowledge, patents, brand names, reputation, strategic strengths, and so on. Most of these assets are not found on the balance sheet unless an acquiring company pays for them and records them as goodwill. The exception is intellectual property, such as patents and copyrights. This can be shown on the balance sheet and amortized over its useful life.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2051">And now we want to tell a little story about goodwill; it shows the art of finance at work.</p>
<p class="P41">In years past, goodwill was amortized. (Remember, amortization is the same idea as depreciation, except that it applies to intangible assets.) Assets were typically depreciated over two to five years, but goodwill was amortized over thirty years. That was the rule.</p>
<p class="P41">Then the rule changed. The people who write those generally accepted accounting principles—the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB—decided that if goodwill consists of the reputation, the customer base, and so on of the company you are buying, then all those assets don’t lose value over time. They actually may become <em>more </em>valuable over time. In short, goodwill is more like land than it is like equipment. So not amortizing it helps accountants portray that accurate reflection of reality that they are always seeking.</p>
<p class="P41">But look at the effect. When you bought MJQ Storage, you wound up with $3 million worth of goodwill on your balance sheet. Before the rule change, you would have amortized the goodwill over thirty years at $100,000 per year. In other words, you would have deducted $100,000 a year from revenue, thereby reducing the profitability of your company by the same amount. Meanwhile, you’re depreciating MJQ’s physical assets (worth $2 million) over, say, a four-year period at $500,000 per year. Again, that $500,000 would be subtracted from revenue to determine profit.</p>
<p class="P41">So what happens? Before the rule change, other things being equal, you wanted to have <em>more </em>goodwill and <em>less </em>in physical assets, simply because goodwill is amortized over a longer period of time, so the amount subtracted from revenue to determine profit is less (keeping profits higher). You had an incentive to shop for companies where most of what you’d be buying was goodwill, and you had an incentive to <em>undervalue </em>the physical assets of the company you were buying. (Remember, it is often your own people who are doing the appraisal of those assets!)</p>
<p class="P41">Today, goodwill sits on the books and isn’t amortized. Now nothing at all is subtracted from revenue, and profitability is correspondingly higher. You have an even bigger incentive to look for companies without much in <span id="page_102">the </span>way of physical assets, and even more of an incentive to undervalue those assets. Tyco was one company that was accused of taking advantage of this rule. Several years ago, as we noted earlier, Tyco was buying companies at breakneck speed—more than six hundred in two years’ time. Many analysts felt that Tyco regularly undervalued the assets of these numerous companies. Doing so would increase the goodwill included in all those acquisitions and lower the depreciation Tyco had to take each year. That, in turn, would make profit higher and in theory would drive up Tyco’s share price.</p>
<p class="P41">But eventually, analysts and investors noticed a fact that we alluded to in <a href="07_PART_ONE.html#page_1">part 1</a>, namely that Tyco had too much goodwill on its books and too little (relatively speaking) in the way of physical assets. They began focusing on a measure called <em>tangible net worth</em>, which is just total assets minus intangible assets minus liabilities. When this metric turns negative, investors tend to get nervous and often sell their stock.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Intellectual Property, Patents, and Other Intangibles</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">How do you account for the cost of creating a new software program that you expect to generate revenue for years? What about the cost of developing a new wonder drug, which is protected by a twenty-year patent (from the date of application)? Obviously, it makes no sense to record the whole cost as an expense on the income statement in any given period, any more than you would record the whole cost of buying a truck. Like a truck, the software and the patent will help generate revenue in future accounting periods. So these investments are considered intangible assets and should be amortized over the life of the revenue stream they generate. By the same token, however, R&amp;D expenses that do <em>not </em>result in an asset likely to generate revenue should be recorded as an expense on the income statement.</p>
<p class="P41">You can see the potential for subjectivity here. Some software companies, for example, are famous for spending considerable sums on R&amp;D, then amortizing those sums over time, thus making their profits look higher. Others choose to expense R&amp;D as it is incurred—a more conservative approach. Amortization is fine if the R&amp;D is actually expected to generate revenue, but not if it isn’t. Computer Associates is one company that got itself into trouble for amortizing R&amp;D on products that had a questionable future. But even when there is no question of fraud, you need to know <span id="page_103">how </span>aggressive or conservative your company’s policies and practices on amortization are. Like depreciation, amortization decisions can often have a sizable effect on profitability and owners’ equity.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Accruals and Prepaid Assets</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">To explain this line item, let’s look at a hypothetical example. Say you start a bicycle manufacturing company, and you rent manufacturing space for the entire year for $60,000. Since your company is a lousy credit risk—nobody likes to do business with a start-up for just this reason—the landlord insists on payment up front.</p>
<p class="P41">Now, we know from the matching principle that it doesn’t make sense to “book” the entire $60,000 in January as an expense on the income statement. It’s rent for the whole year, and it has to be spread out over all twelve months. So in January you put $5,000 on the income statement for rent. But where does the other $55,000 go? You have to keep track of it somewhere. Well, prepaid rent is one example of a prepaid asset. You have bought something—you own the rights to that space for a year—so it is an asset. And you keep track of assets on the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="P41">Every month, of course, you’ll have to move $5,000 out of the prepaid-asset line on the balance sheet and put it in the income statement as an expense for rent. That’s called an accrual, and the “account” on the balance sheet that records what has not yet been expensed is called an accrued asset account. Though the terms are confusing, note that the practice is still conservative: we’re keeping track of all our known expenses, and we’re also tracking what we paid for in advance.</p>
<p class="P41">But the art of finance can creep in here as well, because there is room for judgment on what to accrue and what to charge in any given period. Say, for example, your company is developing a major advertising campaign. The work is all done in January, and it comes to $1 million. The accountants might decide that this campaign will benefit the company for two years, so they would book the $1 million as a prepaid asset and charge one-twenty-fourth of the cost each month on the income statement. A company facing a tough month is likely to decide that this is the best course—after all, it’s better to deduct one-twenty-fourth of a million dollars from profits than the whole million. But what if January is a great month? Then the company might decide to “expense” the entire campaign—charge it all <span id="page_104">against </span>January’s revenue—because, well, they aren’t <em>sure </em>that it will help generate revenue during the next two years. Now they have an advertising campaign that’s all paid for, and profits in the months to come will be correspondingly higher. In a perfect world, our accounting friends would have a crystal ball to tell them exactly how long that advertising campaign will generate revenue. Since they don’t yet have such a device, they must rely on estimates.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>VALUING ASSETS: THE MARK-TO-MARKET RULE</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Though most assets are valued at purchase price less accumulated depreciation, there is one exception to this approach. It’s known as the <em>mark-to-market rule</em>, and use of the rule is often called <em>mark-to-market accounting</em>. The rule allows (and in some cases requires) certain classes of assets to be listed at their current market value. To qualify for this kind of treatment, assets must meet two criteria. One, their value must be able to be determined without an appraisal. Two, they must be held by the company as short-term investments.</p>
<p class="P41">Publicly traded financial assets such as stocks and bonds, whose value is determined every day in the public markets, may meet these two criteria. Imagine, for instance, that Amalgamated Services has a spare $100 million dollars in cash on its balance sheet and chooses to buy 1 million shares of IBM at $100 a share. Amalgamated lists its new current asset on the balance sheet as “stock $100 million.” Three months later, the IBM stock is trading at $110. Amalgamated now marks the 1 million shares up to $110 million and records a gain of $10 million on its income statement (typically in the line labeled “other income”). Of course, if the stock is at $95 after three months, then Amalgamated’s stock holding must be marked down to $95 million, and it must record a loss of $5 million in the income statement. Unlike in conventional accounting, Amalgamated records these gains or losses while it is still holding the stock. So mark-to-market accounting gains or losses take place purely on paper.</p>
<p class="P41">The financial crisis of 2008 revealed two issues surrounding this rule that can have serious consequences in the capital markets. First, how does one determine whether a certain group of assets is held for sale or held as a long-term investment? Two businesses could have the same assets, one <span id="page_105">designating </span>them as buy-and-sell and thus marking them to market, the other planning to hold the assets and thus valuing them at cost. It seems strange that the same assets can be presented differently, depending on an organization’s intentions. Second, what happens when the market nearly collapses or fails outright? In the toolbox following this part, we’ll see what happened when hundreds of financial institutions were forced to mark their loan assets to market. The financial crisis was in many ways a mark-to-market crisis, as we explain in the toolbox. But if the crisis eases and the institution then chooses to hold the assets until the market recovers, must it still take the mark-to-market losses? This is a question that is still under debate.</p>
<p class="P41">That’s it for assets. Add them all up, along with whatever extraneous items you might find, and you get the “total assets” line at the bottom of the left side. Now it’s time to move on to the other side—liabilities and owners’ equity.</p>
