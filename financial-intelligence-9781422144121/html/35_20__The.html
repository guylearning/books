<p class="C2056"><strong>The Power of Ratios</strong></p>
<p class="P68">The eyes may or may not be a window into the soul, as Immanuel Kant suggested, but ratios are definitely a window into a company’s financial statements. They offer a quick shortcut to understanding what the financials are saying.</p>
<p class="P41">There’s a classic story that illustrates this point very well. The year was 1997. The notorious “Chainsaw Al” Dunlap had recently become chief executive of Sunbeam, then an independent appliance maker. By the time he arrived at Sunbeam, Dunlap already had a great reputation on Wall Street and a standard <em>modus operandi</em>. He would show up at a troubled company, fire the management team, bring in his own people, and immediately start slashing expenses by closing down or selling factories and laying off thousands of employees. Soon the company would be showing a profit because of all those cuts, even though it might not be well positioned for the longer term. Dunlap would then arrange for it to be sold, usually at a premium—which meant that he was often hailed as a champion of shareholder value. Sunbeam’s stock jumped more than 50 percent on the news that he’d been hired as CEO.</p>
<p class="P41">At Sunbeam, everything went according to the usual plan until Dunlap began readying the company for sale. By then, he had cut the workforce in half, from twelve thousand to six thousand, and was reporting strong profits. Wall Street was so impressed that Sunbeam’s stock price had gone through the roof—which, as we noted earlier, turned out to be a major <span id="page_158">problem. </span>When the investment bankers went out to sell the company, the price was so high that they had trouble identifying prospective buyers. Dunlap’s only hope was to boost sales and earnings to a level that could justify the kind of premium a buyer would have to offer for Sunbeam’s stock.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>ACCOUNTING TRICKS</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">We now know that Dunlap and his CFO, Russ Kersh, used a whole bag of accounting tricks in that fourth quarter to make Sunbeam look far stronger and more profitable than it actually was. One of the tricks was a perversion of a technique called <em>bill-and-hold</em>.</p>
<p class="P41">Bill-and-hold is essentially a way of accommodating retailers who want to buy large quantities of products for sale in the future, but put off paying for them until the products are actually being sold. Say that you have a chain of toy stores, and you want to ensure that you have an adequate supply of Barbie dolls for the Christmas season. Sometime in the spring, you might go to Mattel and propose a deal whereby you’ll buy a certain number of Barbies, take delivery of them, and even allow Mattel to bill you for them—but you won’t pay for the dolls until the Christmas season rolls around and you start selling them. Meanwhile, you’ll keep them in a warehouse. It’s a good deal for you, since you can count on having the Barbies when you need them, yet you can hold off paying for them until you have decent cash flow. It’s also a good deal for Mattel, which can make the sale and record it immediately, even though it has to wait a few more months to collect the cash.</p>
<p class="P41">Dunlap figured that a variation on bill-and-hold was one answer to his problem. The fourth quarter was not a particularly strong period for Sunbeam, which made a lot of products geared toward summer—gas grills, for example. So Sunbeam went to major retailers such as Walmart and Kmart and offered to guarantee that they’d have all the grills they wanted for the following summer provided they did their buying in the middle of winter. They’d be billed immediately, but they wouldn’t have to pay until spring, when they actually put the goods in the stores. The retailers were cool to the idea. They didn’t have anywhere to keep all that stuff, nor did they want to bear the cost of storing the inventory through the winter. “No problem,” <span id="page_159">said </span>Sunbeam. “We’ll take care of that for you. We’ll lease space near your facilities and cover all the storage costs ourselves.”</p>
<p class="P41">Supposedly, the retailers agreed to those terms, although an audit conducted after Dunlap was fired failed to turn up a complete paper trail. In any case, Sunbeam went ahead and reported an additional $36 million in sales for the fourth quarter based on the bill-and-hold deals it had initiated. The scam worked well enough to fool most analysts, investors, and even Sunbeam’s board of directors, which in early 1998 rewarded Dunlap and other members of the executive team with lucrative new employment contracts. Although they had been on the job for less than a year, they received some $38 million in stock grants, based largely on the mistaken belief that the company had just had a stellar fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="P41">But Andrew Shore, a consumer-products analyst with the investment firm Paine Webber, had been following Sunbeam since Dunlap arrived, and now was scrutinizing its financials. He noticed some oddities, like higher-than-normal sales in the fourth quarter. Then he calculated a ratio called <em>days sales outstanding </em>(DSO) and found that it was huge, far above what it ought to have been. In effect, it indicated that the company’s accounts receivable had gone through the roof. That was a bad sign, so he called a Sunbeam accountant to ask what was going on. The accountant told Shore about the bill-and-hold strategy. Shore realized that Sunbeam, in effect, had already recorded a hefty chunk of sales that would normally appear in the first and second quarters. After discovering this bill-and-hold game and other questionable practices, he promptly downgraded the stock.</p>
<p class="P41">The rest, as they say, is history. Dunlap tried to hang on, but the stock plummeted and investors grew wary of what Sunbeam’s financials were telling them. Eventually, Dunlap was forced out and Sunbeam went bankrupt—and it all started because Andrew Shore knew enough to dig beneath the surface and find out what was really going on. Ratios such as DSO were a useful tool for Shore, as they can be for you.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>ANALYZING RATIOS</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Ratios indicate the relationship of one number to another. People use them every day. A baseball player’s batting average of .333 shows the relationship between hits and official at bats—one hit for every three at bats. The odds <span id="page_160">of </span>winning a lottery jackpot, say one in 6 million, show the relationship between winning tickets sold (1) and total tickets sold (6 million). Ratios don’t require any complex calculations. To figure a ratio, usually, you just divide one number by another and then express the result as a decimal or as a percentage.</p>
<p class="C1974">All kinds of people use all kinds of financial ratios in assessing a business. For example:</p>
<p class="C1980">• Bankers and other lenders examine ratios such as debt-to-equity, which gives them an idea of whether a company will be able to pay back a loan.</p>
<p class="C1980">• Senior managers watch ratios such as gross margin, which helps them be aware of rising costs or inappropriate discounting.</p>
<p class="C1980">• Credit managers assess potential customers’ financial health by inspecting the quick ratio, which gives them an indication of the customer’s supply of ready cash compared with its current liabilities.</p>
<p class="C1981">• Potential and current shareholders look at ratios such as price-to-earnings, which helps them decide whether a company is valued high or low by comparison with other stocks (and with its own value in previous years).</p>
<p class="C2051">In this part of the book we’ll show you how to calculate many such ratios. The ability to calculate them—to read between the lines of the financials, so to speak—is a mark of financial intelligence. Learning about ratios will give you a host of intelligent questions to ask your boss or CFO. And, of course, we’ll show you how to use them to boost your company’s performance.</p>
<p class="P41"><em>The power of ratios lies in the fact that the numbers in the financial statements by themselves don’t reveal the whole story</em>. Is net profit of $10 million a healthy bottom line for a company? Who knows? It depends on the size of the company, on what net profit was last year, on how much net profit was expected to be this year, and on many other variables. If you ask whether a $10 million profit is good or bad, the only possible answer is the one given <span id="page_161">by </span>the woman in the old joke. Asked how her husband was, she replied, “Compared to what?”</p>
<p class="P41">Ratios offer points of comparison and thus tell you more than the raw numbers alone. Profit, for example, can be compared with sales, or with total assets, or with the amount of equity shareholders have invested in the company. A different ratio expresses each relationship, and each gives you a way of gauging whether a $10 million profit is good news or bad news. As we’ll see, many of the different line items on the financials are incorporated into ratios. Those ratios help you understand whether the numbers you’re looking at are favorable or unfavorable.</p>
<p class="C1974">What’s more, the ratios themselves can be compared. For instance:</p>
<p class="C1980">•<em> You can compare ratios with themselves over time. </em>Is profit relative to sales up or down this year? This level of analysis can reveal some powerful trend lines—and some big warning flags if the ratios are headed in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="C1980">•<em> You can also compare ratios with what was projected. </em>To pick just one of the ratios we’ll be examining in this part, if your inventory turnover is worse than you expected it to be, you need to find out why.</p>
<p class="C1981">•<em> You can compare ratios with industry averages. </em>If you find that your company’s key ratios are worse than those of your competitors, you definitely want to figure out the reason. To be sure, not all the ratio results we discuss will be similar from one company to another, even in the same industry. For most, there’s a reasonable range. It’s when the ratios get outside of that range, as Sunbeam’s DSO did, that it’s worth your attention.</p>
<p class="C2051">There are four categories of ratios that managers and other stakeholders in a business typically use to analyze the company’s performance: profitability, leverage, liquidity, and efficiency. We will give you examples in each category. Note, however, that many of these formulas can be tinkered with by the financial folks to address specific approaches or concerns. We see this on a regular basis with our clients. The formulas used by one client in Silicon Valley, for example, were highly specific to its business; as a result, it was difficult to compare the company’s results to those of a competitor, <span id="page_162">which </span>also had its own unique formulas. Tinkering of this sort doesn’t mean that people are cooking the books, only that they are using their expertise to obtain the most useful information for particular situations (yes, there is art even in formulas). What we will provide are the foundational formulas, the ones you need to learn first. Each provides a different view—like looking into a house through windows on all four sides.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>A WORD OF CAUTION</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">We do want to add a note of caution before we begin. In our experience, some companies focus attention on one or two ratios while ignoring other key ratios and the big picture of the business. For example, every public company concerns itself with earnings per share, which is a ratio that investors watch closely. And many watch net profit margin to the exclusion of ratios that might indicate suboptimal performance in other areas.</p>
<p class="P41">When Joe worked at Ford in the early 1990s, for example, he was given the assignment of pricing a certain category of aftermarket parts. Ford wanted a predetermined profit margin on the entire line of parts and required that prices be set accordingly. In Joe’s product line, it turned out that Ford had a warehouse full of old Mustang parts that just wouldn’t sell. Because Ford’s prices were high, would-be buyers could get the parts much cheaper from a junkyard or third-party sellers.</p>
<p class="P41">Joe realized that these parts were costing Ford warehousing space, and that they sat on the company’s balance sheet as inventory, which as we know ties up cash. But when he suggested deeply discounting the parts to free up space and get them out of inventory, management’s answer was simple: no. If we did that, they said, the product line would not hit its profit margin target. So the price discount was never considered.</p>
<p class="P41">In our view, Ford at the time was too focused on one ratio, profit margin, while ignoring ratios that might have indicated the value of selling the parts. If it discounted the parts, the margin it received would have been below its target. But overall total profit would have been higher because the parts hadn’t been selling at all up to then. Moreover, the company would have freed up warehouse space and converted some of its inventory to cash. Return on assets, free cash flow, and asset turnover, to name a few other ratios, would have improved.</p>
<p class="P41"><span id="page_163">One </span>more caution: when you are looking at ratios, you also need to consider the overall value of the numbers. If Walmart consistently earns a 3 percent profit margin on annual sales of over $400 billion, that is a lot more money than a 30 percent profit margin on a business with $50 million in sales. While ratios are an important piece of the financial puzzle, you always need to put them in context to get the complete picture.</p>
