<p class="C2056"><strong>Why Cash Matters</strong></p>
<p class="P68">Of course, by now you may be saying to yourself, “So what? All this is cumbersome to figure out, and why do I care?”</p>
<p class="P41">For starters, let’s see what our sample company’s cash flow statement reveals. In terms of operations, it is certainly doing a good job of generating cash. Operating cash flow is considerably higher than net income. Inventory declined, so it’s reasonable to suppose that the company is tightening up its operations. All of this makes for a stronger cash position.</p>
<p class="P41">We can also see, however, that there is not a lot of new investment going on. Depreciation outweighed new investment, which makes us wonder if management believes that the company has much of a future. Meanwhile, the company is paying its shareholders a healthy dividend, which may suggest that they value it more for its cash-generating potential than for its future. (Many growing companies don’t pay large dividends because they retain the earnings to invest in the business. Some pay no dividends at all.)</p>
<p class="P41">Of course, these are all suppositions about our sample company. To really know the truth, you’d have to know a lot more about the company, what business it’s in, and so on—the big-picture part of financial intelligence. But if you did know all those things, the cash flow statement would be extraordinarily revealing.</p>
<p class="P41">That brings us to your own situation as a manager and to your own company’s cash flow. We think there are three big reasons for looking at and trying to understand the cash flow statement.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong><span id="page_149">THE </span>POWER OF UNDERSTANDING CASH FLOW</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">First, knowing your company’s cash situation will help you understand what is going on now, where the business is headed, and what senior management’s priorities are likely to be. You need to know not just whether the overall cash position is healthy but specifically where the cash is coming from. Is it from operations? That’s a good thing—it means the business is generating cash. Is investing cash flow a sizable negative number? If it isn’t, it may mean that the company isn’t investing in its future. And what about financing cash flow? If investment money is coming in, that may be an optimistic sign for the future, or it may mean that the company is desperately selling stock to stay afloat. Looking at the cash flow statement may generate a lot of questions, but they are the right ones to be asking. Are we paying off loans? Why or why not? Are we buying equipment? The answers to those questions will reveal a lot about senior management’s plans for the company.</p>
<p class="C1974">Second, you <em>affect </em>cash. As we’ve said before, managers should be focusing on both profit and cash. Of course, their impact is usually limited to operating cash flow—but that’s one of the most important measures there is. For instance:</p>
<p class="C1980">•<em> Accounts receivable. </em>If you’re in sales, are you selling to customers who pay their bills on time? Do you have a close enough relationship with your customers to talk with them about payment terms? If you’re in customer service, do you offer customers the kind of service that will encourage them to pay their bills on time? Is the product free of defects? Are the invoices accurate? Does the mailroom send invoices on a timely basis? Is the receptionist helpful? All these factors help determine how customers feel about your company and indirectly influence how fast they are likely to pay their bills. Disgruntled customers are not known for prompt payments—they like to wait until any dispute is resolved.</p>
<p class="C1980">•<em> Inventory. </em>If you’re in engineering, do you request special products all the time? If you do, you may be creating an inventory nightmare. If you’re in operations and you like to have lots in stock, just in case, you may be creating a situation in which cash is just sitting on the shelves, <span id="page_150">when </span>it could be used for something else. Manufacturing and warehouse managers can often reduce inventory hugely by studying and applying the principles of lean enterprise, pioneered at Toyota.</p>
<p class="C1980">•<em> Expenses. </em>Do you defer expenses when you can? Do you consider the timing of cash flow when making purchases? Obviously, we’re not saying it’s always wise to defer expenses; it’s just wise to understand what the cash impact will be when you do decide to spend money, and to take that into account.</p>
<p class="C1981">•<em> Giving credit. </em>Do you give credit to potential customers too easily? Alternatively, do you withhold credit when you should give it? Both decisions affect the company’s cash flow and sales, which is why the credit department always has to strike a careful balance.</p>
<p class="C2051">The list goes on. Maybe you’re a plant manager, and you are always recommending buying more equipment, just in case the orders come in. Perhaps you’re in IT, and you feel that the company always needs the latest upgrades to its computer systems. All these decisions affect cash flow, and senior management usually understands that very well. If you want to make an effective request, you need to familiarize yourself with the numbers that they’re looking at.</p>
<p class="P41">Third, managers who understand cash flow tend to be given more responsibilities, and thus tend to advance more quickly, than those who focus purely on the income statement. In the following part, for instance, you’ll learn to calculate ratios such as days sales outstanding (DSO), which is a key measure of the company’s efficiency in collecting receivables. The faster receivables are collected, the better a company’s cash position. You could go to someone in finance and say, “By the way, I notice our DSO has been heading in the wrong direction over the last few months—how can I help turn that around?” Alternatively, you might learn the precepts of lean enterprise, which focus on (among other things) keeping inventories to a minimum. A manager who leads a company in converting to lean thereby frees up huge quantities of cash.</p>
<p class="P41">But our general point here is that cash flow is a key indicator of a company’s financial health, along with profitability and shareholders’ equity. <span id="page_151">It’s </span>the final link in the triad, and you need all three to assess a company’s financial health. It’s also the final link in the first level of financial intelligence. You now have a good understanding of all three financial statements. Now it’s time to move on to the next level—to put that information to work.</p>
