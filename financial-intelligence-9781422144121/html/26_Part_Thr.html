<p class="C1971"><strong><a id="id_174"></a>EXPENSE? OR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE?</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">When a company buys a piece of capital equipment, the cost doesn’t show up on the income statement; rather, the new asset appears on the balance sheet, and only the depreciation appears on the income statement as a charge against profit. You might think the distinction between <em>expense </em>(showing up on the income statement) and <em>capital expenditure </em>(showing up on the balance sheet) would be clear and simple. But of course it isn’t. Indeed, it’s a prime canvas for the art of finance.</p>
<p class="P41">Consider that taking a big item off the income statement and putting it on the balance sheet—so that only the depreciation shows up as a charge against profit—can have the effect of increasing profit considerably. WorldCom, mentioned in <a href="08_1__You_C.html#page_3">chapter 1</a>, is the classic case study. A large portion of WorldCom’s expenses consisted of so-called line costs. These were fees it paid to local phone companies to use their phone lines. Line costs were normally treated as ordinary operating expenses, but you could argue (albeit incorrectly) that some of them were actually investments in new markets and wouldn’t start paying off for years. That was the logic pursued by CFO Scott Sullivan, anyway, who began “capitalizing” his company’s line costs. Bingo: these expenses disappeared off the income statement, and profits rose by billions of dollars. To Wall Street, it appeared that WorldCom was suddenly generating much more in profits than it had before—and no one caught on until later, when the whole house of cards collapsed.</p>
<p class="P41">WorldCom took an overaggressive approach toward capitalizing its costs and ended up in hot water. But some companies will treat the occasional <span id="page_120">questionable </span>item as a capital expenditure just to pump up their earnings a little. Does yours?</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong><a id="id_176"></a>THE IMPACT OF MARK-TO-MARKET ACCOUNTING</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Mark-to-market accounting, as we explained in <a href="22_11__Asse.html#page_95">chapter 11</a>, involves valuing certain financial assets at their current prices rather than by their historical cost. The financial crisis that began in 2008 was in many respects a mark-to-market accounting crisis. Let’s see why.</p>
<p class="P41">First, consider a simplified accounting of a bank’s assets and liabilities. Its assets include loans made to others plus cash. Its liabilities include customer deposits such as checking and savings account balances. Fundamentally, a bank makes money by taking deposits and then lending that money out at a higher rate than it must pay its depositors.</p>
<p class="P41">In the 1980s, however, many savings and loan institutions—small banks that specialized in home mortgages—found themselves in a pickle. Their assets consisted mainly of long-term mortgages, which paid a relatively low interest rate. Meanwhile, depositors were demanding high interest rates on their deposits because inflation at the time was so high. To keep the depositors from withdrawing their funds, the S&amp;Ls had to pay out more in interest than they were making on their assets. In a matter of months, hundreds of them became insolvent.</p>
<p class="P41">As a result of this issue, the government then began requiring financial institutions to maintain a balance between the duration of their loans and their deposits. That meant the banks couldn’t offer long-term mortgages because depositors didn’t want to tie up their money for that long. To solve the problem, the government commissioned two enterprises known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy mortgages from the banks, package them into securities, and sell the securities to investors. These new instruments were known as mortgage-backed securities, and they were highly popular. They paid a good interest rate, and they seemed safe. The loans that Freddie and Fannie could buy had to meet certain requirements, and were known as prime loans.</p>
<p class="P41">After several years, other financial organizations began buying mortgages that did not fit the requirements for prime loans. They packaged these riskier “subprime” loans into securities and sold the securities to <span id="page_121">investors. </span>Soon, even Freddie and Fannie were allowed to buy subprime mortgages, since the government believed that doing so would help more people become homeowners. All this created an environment where almost anybody could get a mortgage. That boosted demand for housing, which drove up housing prices and seemed to provide investors even more safety. With home prices rising, any default would always be covered by higher home values.</p>
<p class="P41">Since banks were originating these mortgages and selling them within a week to a ready market, the mortgages were considered mark-to-market assets on their balance sheets. Many banks held billions of dollars’ worth of mortgages that they planned to resell for a profit. But then the housing market began its collapse. Prices fell. More homeowners defaulted. Most investors quit buying the mortgage-backed securities, and the middlemen who created them quit buying mortgages from the banks. With no ready buyers, the value of the mortgages held by the banks plunged.</p>
<p class="P41">Now let’s go back to the mark-to-market rule, which said that the bank must mark these mortgages down to their current market value. If a bank held $10 billion worth of mortgages and the market dropped 10 percent, it would have to record a loss of $1 billion. That might wipe out all its equity, and the bank would have to be shut down.</p>
<p class="P41">In the fourth quarter of 2008, something very much like this scenario happened to hundreds of banks across the United States. News reports told the public about the “toxic” assets the banks couldn’t sell. The government responded with the $800 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to bail out many of the troubled banks. In many cases, however, the banks were not actually insolvent: borrowers were still paying, and the banks could rely on the interest rate spread to meet the needs of depositors. But the mark-to-market rule drove them to their knees.</p>
<p class="P41">Since the crisis, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has modified the mark-to-market rules for financial institutions in ways that limits the losses a bank might need to take in such circumstances. But the board’s moves were too little and too late to affect the crisis.</p>
