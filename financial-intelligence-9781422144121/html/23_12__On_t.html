<p class="C2056"><strong>On the Other Side</strong></p>
<p class="C2264"><strong>Liabilities and Equity</strong></p>
<p class="P68">We said earlier that liabilities are what a company owes and equity is its net worth. There’s another—only slightly different—way to look at this side of the balance sheet, which is that <em>it shows how the assets were obtained</em>. If a company borrows funds in any way, shape, or form to obtain an asset, the borrowing is going to show up on one or another of the liabilities lines. If it sells stock to obtain an asset, that will be reflected on one of the lines under owners’ equity.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>TYPES OF LIABILITIES</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">But first things first, which on this side of the balance sheet means liabilities, the financial obligations a company owes to other entities. Liabilities are always divided into two main categories. <em>Current </em>liabilities are those that have to be paid off in less than a year. <em>Long-term </em>liabilities are those that come due over a longer time frame. Liabilities are usually listed on the balance sheet from shortest-term to longest-term, so the very layout tells you something about what’s due when.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong><span id="page_107">Current </span>Portion of Long-Term Debt</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">If your company owes $100,000 to a bank on a long-term loan, maybe $10,000 of it is due this year. So that’s the amount that shows up in the current liabilities section of the balance sheet. The line will be labeled “current portion of long-term debt” or something like that. The other $90,000 shows up under long-term liabilities.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Short-Term Loans</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">These are lines of credit and short-term revolving loans. These short-term credit lines are usually secured by current assets such as accounts receivable and inventory. The entire balance outstanding is shown here.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Accounts Payable</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Accounts payable shows the amount the company owes its vendors. The company receives goods and services from suppliers every day and typically doesn’t pay their bills for at least thirty days. The vendors, in effect, have loaned the company money. Accounts payable shows how much was owed on the date of the balance sheet. Any balance on a company’s credit cards is usually included in accounts payable.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Accrued Expenses and Other Short-Term Liabilities</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">This catch-all category includes everything else the company owes. One example is payroll. Let’s assume that you get paid on October 1. Does it make sense to charge your pay as an expense on the income statement in October? Probably not—your October paycheck is for work performed in September. So the accountants would figure out or estimate how much the company owes you on October 1 for work completed in September and then charge those expenses to September. This is an accrued liability. It’s like an internal bill in September for a payment to be made in October. Accrued liabilities are part of the matching principle—we have matched expenses with the revenue they help to bring in every month.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Deferred Revenue</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Some companies have an item called <em>deferred revenue </em>on their balance sheets. This is puzzling to the financial novice: how can revenue be a <span id="page_108">liability? </span>Well, a liability is a financial obligation the company owes to others. Deferred revenue represents money received for products or services that have not yet been delivered. So it’s an obligation. Once the product or service has been delivered, the corresponding revenue will be included in the top line of the income statement, and it will come off the balance sheet. Industries where you might see deferred revenue on the balance sheet include airlines (you pay before you fly) and project-based businesses (a client typically makes a down payment prior to the start of the work). This method of dealing with revenue not yet earned is in line with the principle of conservatism: don’t recognize gains until they are actually earned.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Long-Term Liabilities</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Most long-term liabilities are loans. But there are also other liabilities that you might see listed here. Examples include deferred bonuses or compensation, deferred taxes, and pension liabilities. If these other liabilities are substantial, this section of the balance sheet needs to be watched closely.</p>
<p class="C2104"><strong>OWNERS’ EQUITY</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Finally! Remember the equation? Owners’ equity is what’s left after we subtract liabilities from assets. Equity includes the capital provided by investors and the profits retained by the company over time. Owners’ equity goes by many names, including shareholders’ equity and stockholders’ equity. The owners’ equity line items listed in some companies’ balance sheets <span id="page_109">can </span>be quite detailed and confusing. They typically include the following categories.</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Capital</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">The word means a number of things in business. <em>Physical </em>capital is plant, equipment, vehicles, and the like. <em>Financial </em>capital from an investor’s point of view is the stocks and bonds he holds; from a company’s point of view it is the shareholders’ equity investment plus whatever funds the company has borrowed. “Sources of capital” in an annual report shows where the company got its money. “Uses of capital” shows how the company used its money.</p>
<p class="C2809b">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Preferred Shares</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Preferred shares—also known as preference stock or shares—are a specific type of stock. People who hold preferred shares usually receive dividends on their investment before the holders of common stock get a nickel. But preferred shares typically carry a fixed dividend, so their price doesn’t fluctuate as much as the price of common shares. Investors who hold preferred shares may not receive the full benefit of a company’s growth in value. When the company issues preferred shares, it sells them to investors at a certain initial price. The value shown on the balance sheet reflects that price.</p>
<p class="P41">Most preferred shares do not carry voting rights. In a way, they’re more like bonds than like common stock. The difference? With a bond, the owner gets a fixed coupon or interest payment, and with preferred shares the owner gets a fixed dividend. Companies use preferred stock to raise money because it does not carry the same legal implications as debt. If a company cannot pay a coupon on a bond, bondholders can force it into bankruptcy. Holders of preferred shares normally can’t.</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong>Common Shares or Common Stock</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Unlike most preferred shares, common shares usually carry voting rights. People who hold them can vote for members of the board of directors (usually one share, one vote) and on any other matter that may be put before the shareholders. Common shares may or may not pay dividends. The value shown on the balance sheet is based on the issuing price of the shares; it’s shown as “par value” and “paid-in capital.”</p>
<p class="C2809a">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2809"><strong>Dividends</strong></p>
<p class="C2115">Dividends are funds distributed to shareholders taken from a company’s equity. In public companies, dividends are typically distributed at the end of a quarter or year.</p>
<p class="C2809b">.   .   .</p>
<p class="C2103"><strong><span id="page_110">Retained </span>Earnings</strong></p>
<p class="C2084">Retained earnings or accumulated earnings are the profits that have been reinvested in the business instead of being paid out in dividends. The number represents the <em>total </em>after-tax income that has been reinvested or retained over the life of the business. Sometimes a company that holds a lot of retained earnings in the form of cash—Microsoft is an example—comes under pressure to pay out some of the money to shareholders, in the form of dividends. After all, what shareholder wants to see his money just sitting there in the company’s coffers, rather than being reinvested in productive assets? Of course, you may see an accumulated deficit—a negative number—which indicates that the company has lost money over time.</p>
<p class="P41">So owners’ equity is what the shareholders would receive if the company were sold, right? Of course not! Remember all those rules, estimates, and assumptions that affect the balance sheet. Assets are recorded at their acquisition price less accumulated depreciation. Goodwill is piled up with every acquisition the company makes, and it is never amortized. And of course the company has intangible assets of its own, such as its brand name and customer list, which don’t show up on the balance sheet at all. Moral: the market value of a company almost <em>never </em>matches its equity or book value on the balance sheet. The actual market value of a company is what a willing buyer would pay for it. In the case of a public company, that value is estimated by calculating the company’s market cap, or the number of shares outstanding times the share price on any given day. In the case of private companies, the market value can be estimated by one of the valuation methods described in <a href="07_PART_ONE.html#page_1">part 1</a>.</p>
