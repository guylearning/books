<p class="ct">Another Way to Create Cash Flow Statements (A Simple Debit and Credit Approach)</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are comfortable with debits and credits, the Cash Flow Statement can be prepared by creating T accounts for all Balance Sheet items and adjusting all changes to the cash account.<a href="#c11an5" id="ic11an5"><sup>5</sup></a> This is done by creating a large T account for cash divided into three sections (Operations, Investing, and Financing) and smaller T accounts for everything else. Then, for each change (debit or credit) required to adjust each account (other than cash) from its opening to closing balance, a corresponding opposite change (credit or debit) is made into the large cash T account. Let us do this for our example above.</p>
<p class="indent1">For each small T account below, the opening and closing numbers are in bold and the required entry to balance the specific account is in italics. Whatever entry is required in the small T account to balance (a debit or credit), the opposite entry (a credit or debit) is made in the large cash T account below. The entries are numbered in parentheses to help you match them with the numbers in the cash T account. Underneath each small T account is also a written description of the impact to the small T account and cash.</p>
<p class="image" id="page_171"><img src="../images/img-171.jpg" width="529" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="noindent1">(Note that CA stands for current assets, CL for current liabilities, and Divd. for dividends.)</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_172"></a>The opposite of each adjustment (in italics above) is then entered into the cash T account below.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-172.jpg" width="511" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">To explain the T account entries above:</p>
<p class="nl"> (1)  Opening receivables is a debit balance of $200, and there is a closing debit balance of $240. This means a total net debit of $40 is required to go from the opening to the closing balance in receivables. The <a id="page_173"></a>corresponding entry to cash is a credit of $40. The firm collected the opening receivables plus this year’s sales less the closing receivables. If receivables increase, it means the firm collected less than this year’s sales. So cash decreases.</p>
<p class="nl"> (2)  Opening inventory is a debit balance of $300, and there is a closing debit balance of $350. This means a net debit of $50 is required to go from the opening to the closing balance in inventory. The corresponding entry to cash is a credit of $50. Cash decreases because inventory increases: All else equal, this means the firm purchased and paid for more inventory than the cost of goods sold (e.g., remember above, we first determined purchases and then amounts paid).</p>
<p class="nl"> (3)  Other current assets (like prepaid expenses) has an opening debit balance of $50 and a closing debit balance of $40. This means a net credit of $10 was made during the year. Thus, a net debit of $10 is made in the large T account for cash. If there were no change in other current assets, then the other expense amount on the Income Statement would match the cash paid. Because the other asset account went down, this means the amount of cash the firm paid for other expenses is less than the amount recorded on the Income Statement, which means the firm has more cash at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="nl"> (4)  The accounts of property, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E) and related accumulated depreciation require more adjustments as explained above. Here, we do not just have the opening, closing, and one net debit or credit. Instead, we have multiple entries (in this case, one debit and one credit to each account). The $300 debit to PP&amp;E is for the purchased assets. The corresponding amount is a credit to cash (as this is the actual cash paid for PP&amp;E during the year). This amount is included in cash from investments. Cash went down by this amount because it is a payment of cash for PP&amp;E.</p>
<p class="nl"> (5)  This records the cash received from the sale of PP&amp;E. Note that the proceeds for the sale of PP&amp;E are $162. This is computed from the net book value of $150 ($160 cost of PP&amp;E less the $10 related accumulated depreciation on the asset sold) plus the gain of $12. The total $162 cash received from the sale of PP&amp;E is reported as a debit under cash from investing. However, the sale of PP&amp;E also affects cash from operations. The $12 gain from the sale of PP&amp;E must <a id="page_174"></a>be subtracted from the net profit included in cash from operations in order to avoid double counting it. Remember, we are including the $12 gain under cash from investing as a part of the total $162 in proceeds from the sale of PP&amp;E. Leaving the $12 gain in cash from operations would include the $12 in two places, and the final change in cash computed on the cash flow will be $12 higher than the actual change in the opening and closing cash balance (again, the joy of balancing).</p>
<p class="nl"> (6)  The $50 credit to accumulated depreciation represents depreciation expense. This is a debit to cash from operations. <i>If depreciation expense is related to long-term assets, why is it not included under cash from investing?</i> Depreciation is a noncash expense. That is, the amount reduced net income but there was no cash flow. The related cash flow occurred when the asset was paid for: The entire payment was included, added back, as a reduction in cash from investments at the time of payment. Depreciation expense is included under cash from operations in order to remove the noncash expense from net income.</p>
<p class="nl"> (7)  Payables have an opening credit balance of $260 and a closing credit balance of $290. This means the account had a net increase (credit) of $30. This is related to item (2) above in determining how much cash was paid for inventory. Cash from operations increases (with a debit) because an increase in payables means less cash was paid during the year.</p>
<p class="nl"> (8)  Accrued expenses have an opening credit balance of $140 and a closing credit balance of $125. This means the account had a net decrease (debit) of $15. Cash from operations goes down (is credited) because more cash was paid than the stated amount on the Income Statement.</p>
<p class="nl"> (9)  Long-term debt has an opening credit balance of $200 and a closing credit balance of $325. Above we assume that no debt is paid back, which means $125 was received for new debt issued. However, if debt was retired and new debt was also issued, both the retirement and issue should be shown on the statement because we want to capture all cash flows, in or out, and not just net amounts. For example, if $75 of debt was retired and the long-term debt balance <a id="page_175"></a>still increased by $125, it means there was $200 in new debt issued (opening balance of $200 + new debt of $200 − debt retired of $75 = ending balance of $325).</p>
<p class="nl">(10)  Contributed capital has an opening credit balance of $300 and a closing credit balance of $310. This means the account had net new equity issued (a credit) of $10 (i.e., cash up net $10, contributed capital up net $10). As with long-term debt, if some equity was repurchased but the ending balance remained the same, it means more new equity had been issued. Assuming no equity was repurchased, the net increase in cash from financing is (debited) $10.</p>
<p class="nl">(11)  Retained earnings have an opening credit balance of $50 and a closing credit balance of $90. We see that the account increases (a credit) by the net income of $82. The corresponding amount (debit) is in cash from operations.</p>
<p class="nll">(12)  Finally, we note that opening retained earnings plus net income is more than ending retained earnings. This means that a dividend was paid (a debit in the retained earnings account). The amount required to balance is $42. In the cash T account, this is a credit to cash from financing.</p>
