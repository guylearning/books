<p class="ct"><a href="06_Contents.xhtml#toc5">The Accounting Process</a></p>
<p class="noindent2">The first step to learn about accounting is understanding the process of recording financial information. This process is called bookkeeping and it is a part of what accountants do. To be able to interpret financial information, one must learn the basic vocabulary, concepts, and procedures. After that comes learning about ratio analysis, which is the relationship of one accounting number to another, and is used to examine a firm’s competitive position. The individual accounting numbers themselves are only the starting point.</p>
<p class="h1">Account—The Basic Unit of Storage</p>
<p class="noindent">All organizations maintain a set of accounts (the basic unit of storage) of everything the organization wants to keep track of. Within an organization, this list will be very detailed. For example, a firm will have a separate cash account for each place where cash is stored. This means a firm with a chain of department stores across the country will have a separate cash account not only for its numerous bank accounts but also for each cash register. Likewise, a firm with different types of products will have a separate account for each product in each location. Thus, even a small organization may have hundreds of accounts, whereas a large one can have millions. Remember, the organization is using each account to keep track of something it cares about.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Does a public for-profit firm or charitable organization provide complete information on all its accounts to the general public?</i> No, the organization will provide those outside the firm with only a short summary of the accounts. <i>Why not provide the details?</i> Three reasons: First, those outside the firm do not want very detailed information. Consider Apple Inc. as an example: <a id="page_28"></a><i>Would a potential investor care about how much Apple Inc. has in cash in each of its stores, bank accounts, and factories or would they just want to know the total cash the firm has?</i> The investor would mostly care about the total cash amount. Additionally, providing information on all of Apple’s accounts would overwhelm most outsiders (e.g., 10,000 cash accounts translates to 250 pages at 40 lines a page). Second, it is not cost effective for an organization to provide all its detailed accounting information to the general public. Third, most organizations do not want to reveal specific details of their operations to their competitors, who are able to access any information made available to the general public. Thus, although Apple needs to keep track of each individual cash account, outsiders are only provided with a total amount and probably do not need more than that.</p>
<p class="indent2"><i>If organizations do not provide all of their accounting information, what information do they provide?</i> As explained in more detail below, public organizations provide certain financial statements along with explanations (notes) detailing their accounting choices, estimates, and assumptions.</p>
<p class="h1">The Balance Sheet</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Balance Sheet indicates the resources a firm has and how it is financed. It contains a summary list of certain accounts that are considered “permanent” accounts, as they are cumulative over time and represent the account balance <i>as at</i> an instant in time. The Balance Sheet represents the basic accounting equation:</p>
<p class="center">Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity<a href="#c3n1" id="ic3n1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><b>Assets</b> are resources the firm owns or controls that will provide some future economic benefit to the firm based on a past transaction or event. (It may be useful to read the prior sentence a few times.) Assets are separated into current assets (those which will be used or converted to cash usually within 1 year) and long-term assets.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_29"></a><b>Liabilities</b> represent future economic sacrifices of goods (including cash) or services required because of a past transaction. In other words, liabilities are monies, products or services that are owed to other organizations, people or the government. Like assets, liabilities are also divided into current (those which will be provided within 1 year) and long-term liabilities.</p>
<p class="indent1">Finally, <b>Owners’ Equity</b> is comprised of funds the owners have contributed to the firm. This is composed of two parts: Contributed capital is the amount the owners gave the firm. Retained earnings are the cumulative profit or loss a firm made from its inception to the date of the Balance Sheet minus any funds given to the owners (these funds given to the owners are called dividends). Retained earnings are profits a firm has kept to fund resources. Many people view owners’ equity as being the balancing figure, and it is often referred to as net assets or net worth. The equation is essentially:</p>
<p class="center">Assets − Liabilities = Owners’ Equity</p>
<p class="indent">Although this is mathematically correct, it does not reflect the underlying nature of the accounting process. The left side of the Balance Sheet, the assets, are the resources a firm has available to use. The right side of the Balance Sheet contains the liabilities and owners’ equity, and it is how the firm financed its resources. Both are independently measured and if they are not equal, then a mistake has been made somewhere in the recording process. The mere fact the Balance Sheet balances does not guarantee that mistakes have not been made.</p>
<p class="indent1">A simplified Balance Sheet was presented in <a href="ch02.xhtml#exh2.1">Exhibit 2.1</a>. An example of a comparative Balance Sheet in a more traditional format is presented in <a href="#exh3.1" id="iexh3.1">Exhibit 3.1</a>.<a href="#c3n2" id="ic3n2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p class="image1" id="page_30"><a href="#iexh3.1" id="exh3.1"><img src="../images/ex3.1.jpg" width="488" alt="images"/></a></p>
<p class="indent">First, note the amounts are “as at” (or “as of”) a specific date. In this case, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016. The amounts are reported for a specific instant in time. The year-end does not have to be a calendar (December 31) year-end. A firm can choose a year-end that coincides with its business cycle (e.g., a retail firm might choose its year-end to be shortly after the busy holiday season), but many firms choose calendar year-ends.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, note the example does indeed balance (Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity = $530,000 in 2015 and $620,000 in 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">Third, the amounts can change over time, but do not have to. In the example, both long-term debt and contributed capital do not change (they remain at $200,000 and $220,000, respectively). In this case, the firm apparently did not raise additional long-term debt or funds from its owners in 2016.</p>
<p class="indent2">Finally, retained earnings increased from $32,500 to $80,000. This means the firm earned and <i>kept</i> $47,500. The firm may have earned more than $47,500 (e.g., $58,500) and given the extra (e.g., $11,000) to the owners. More on this shortly.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="page_31"></a>Debit to the Left, Credit to the Right</p>
<p class="noindent1">As mentioned at the start, accounting is an information system. It is designed with checks and balances. One, as noted previously, is that the Balance Sheet has to “balance” (i.e., the left side of the equation, assets, must equal the right side of the equation, liabilities and owners’ equity). A second part of the system is that the total debits must equal the total credits.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-31a.jpg" width="486" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent"><i>What is a debit and what is a credit?</i> To an accountant, the word debit means “to the left” and the word credit means “to the right.” <i>Left or right of what?</i></p>
<p class="indent1">Let us back up a bit. Each account (remember, there is an account for everything the firm keeps track of) has its own page in a book that accountants name the “General Ledger” (now located on a hard drive somewhere in the cloud). Each page states the name of the account (e.g., Cash in Bank X in City Y) and normally has five columns. The first column shows the date of the transaction being recorded. The second is a reference column used to indicate if they have checked a specific item (i.e., when looking for a mistake). The third describes the transaction (e.g., why the firm received the cash or paid it out). The two last columns are used to record the amount of a transaction. A debit is entering the amount in the fourth column (to the left of the fifth column), and a credit is entering an amount in the fifth column (to the right of the fourth column).</p>
<p class="untb-h1">Cash</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/img-31b.jpg" width="497" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent"><i>But when is an account debited or credited?</i> Excellent question. Assets are increased with debits and reduced with credits, whereas liabilities and equity are increased with credits and reduced with debits. <i>Why?</i> There is no logical reason; it is simply the convention.<a href="#c3n3" id="ic3n3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_32"></a>Again, to an accountant, the word debit simply means left and the word credit simply means right. Not good or bad, not up or down, just left and right. Let us start with an owner investing $500 in a firm by giving $500 in cash to the firm. The accounting would be treated as follows:</p>
<p class="untb-h1">Cash (asset)</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-32a.jpg" width="496" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="untb-h1">Contributed capital</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/img-32b.jpg" width="500" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">Note, an asset (cash) increases and an owners’ equity account also increases.<a href="#c3n4" id="ic3n4"><sup>4</sup></a> The Balance Sheet balances. Next the funds are placed in the firm’s bank account, and the following entries to the accounting records are made:</p>
<p class="untb-h1">Cash (asset)</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-32c.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="untb-h1">Cash-in-bank (asset)</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-32d.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">Note, an asset (cash) decreases, and another (cash in bank) increases. Total assets are still $500, and owners’ equity is still $500 (as it has not changed), so the Balance Sheet is still in balance.</p>
<p class="indent1">You may have a different perception of the term debit and credit because of how you have heard the terms used. For example, you may have deposited funds in a bank which then “credits” your account. The bank is not actually doing anything to your accounting records. The bank is adjusting its own accounting records. The bank receives cash and so debits its own cash account. The bank now owes you funds, so it credits <a id="page_33"></a>a liability with your name (and note the debits equal the credits). The bank’s records would be treated as follows:</p>
<p class="untb-h1">Cash (asset)</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-33a.jpg" width="500" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="untb-h1">Deposits (liability)</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-33b.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">The system is designed to limit mistakes by requiring, for each transaction, an equal total amount of debits and credits recorded in the related accounts. Mistakes can, of course, still occur if the wrong accounts are used or if there are matching mistakes in the debits and credits.</p>
<p class="indent1">As shown previously, if assets are increased with debits, then assets must be reduced with credits because the total debits must equal the total credits. For the same reason, because assets are increased with debits, liabilities and owners’ equity are increased with credits. Remember, the Balance Sheet is based on the equation:</p>
<p class="center">Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity</p>
<p class="indent1">The above may sound confusing, but to understand accounting, you only have to remember three things (okay, there is some additional language and techniques as well):</p>
<p class="nl">   1.  The Balance Sheet equation is Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity.</p>
<p class="nl">   2.  Accounts on the left side of the Balance Sheet equation (assets) are increased with a debit (which means left) and reduced with a credit (which means right). Accounts on the right side of the Balance Sheet equation (liabilities and owners’ equity) are increased with a credit and reduced with a debit.</p>
<p class="nll">   3.  Total debits = Total credits.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no rational for why a debit increases an asset and a credit reduces it. This is an arbitrary decision. However, once set, it then makes <a id="page_34"></a>mathematical sense that if assets are increased with a debit and reduced with a credit, then liabilities and owners’ equity would be increased with a credit and reduced with a debit. Liabilities and owners’ equity are on the other side of the equation, so their treatment is the opposite of how assets are treated. Remember, the idea is to catch mistakes; having total debits equal total credits is a means to that end.</p>
<p class="indent">The balance of an account equals the total debits less the total credits posted to it. If the debits exceed the credits, the account has a debit balance. If the credits exceed the debits, the account has a credit balance. Occasionally, there is a sixth column that provides a running total of this debit or credit balance.<a href="#c3n5" id="ic3n5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Accountants often use an abbreviated form of the account called a T account, which looks like a T with the account name on top and then the debits on the left side and the credits on the right side. The T account is basically the last two columns of the formal account above.</p>
<p class="indent1">The net debit or net credit balance is shown in a T account after drawing a line under the debits and credits. For example, if total debits in a particular account are $1.5 million and total credits are $1.2 million, the account has debit balance of $300,000, which would be inserted in the debit column as follows.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-34.jpg" width="486" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent"> </p>
<p class="h1">An Illustration</p>
<p class="noindent1">Let us illustrate with an example. Imagine the first five transactions of a business are as follows:</p>
<p class="nl">   1.  The owners’ give the firm $220,000 cash for their ownership interest in the firm. Cash, an asset, increases by $220,000 with a debit. Contributed capital (CC), an owners’ equity account, increases by <a id="page_35"></a>$220,000 with a credit. Assets = $220,000 = owners’ equity and total debits = total credits = $220,000.</p>
<p class="nl">   2.  The firm borrows $200,000 long-term, agreeing to pay 7 percent interest once a year, at the end of the year, for 10 years and then repay the loan. Cash gets another debit, increases by another $200,000, and now has a $420,000 balance. Long-term debt (LTD) is credited $200,000. Cash, still the only asset, now has a $420,000 debit balance (meaning the firm has $420,000 in its cash account). Liabilities are now $200,000 credit (the long-term debt), whereas owners’ equity is $220,000 credit, for a total liabilities and owners’ equity of $420,000 credit. (Total assets = total liabilities and owners’ equity = $420,000, and total debits = total credits = $420,000).</p>
<p class="nl">   3.  The firm buys some equipment for its operations, paying $310,000 cash. An asset account, called property, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E), increases by $310,000 with a debit and cash decreases by $310,000 (with a credit). The firm now has two assets, cash of $110,000 ($420,000 − $310,000) and PP&amp;E of $310,000 for total assets of $420,000. Liabilities and owners’ equity remain unchanged at $420,000.</p>
<p class="nl">   4.  The firm orders 10,000 T-shirts for $6 each, which it plans to resell. No debits or credits are required here because the firm has not yet received anything (it has no resources yet to increase), has not given up any assets (so there is nothing to reduce), and does not yet owe any funds. Had the firm prepaid, then cash would have decreased and an asset (perhaps called inventory receivable) would have increased because the firm paid and is now owed something. However, because neither the firm nor its supplier has paid or delivered, there is not yet any debit or credit to record.</p>
<p class="nll">   5.  The raw materials (the T-shirts) arrive, but payment is not made immediately because the supplier allows the firm 30 days to pay. Therefore, inventory increases with a debit of $60,000 (10,000 units at $6 each), and a liability, called accounts payable (A/P, meaning amounts owed to suppliers of goods and services), increases with a credit of $60,000. Total assets are now $480,000: cash of $110,000, inventory of $60,000, and PP&amp;E of $310,000. Total liabilities and owners’ equity is also $480,000: A/P of $60,000, LTD of $200,000, and CC of $220,000.</p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_36"></a>The accountant would show these transactions in her journal by listing the date, the account to be debited or credited with the amount, and an explanation. The convention is to list the accounts to be debited first and then the accounts to be credited with the latter being indented (creating amounts on the left and right) followed by a short explanation as follows:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-36a.jpg" width="494" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">At some point after the event (it can be soon after or much later), the amounts are recorded or entered in the specific accounts (accountants call doing this “posting”) as follows:</p>
<p class="untb-h1">Cash</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-36b.jpg" width="506" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="untb-h1"><a id="page_37"></a>Merchandise inventory</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-37a.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="untb-h1">Property, plant and equipment</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-37b.jpg" width="502" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="untb-h1">Accounts payable</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-37c.jpg" width="501" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="untb-h1">Long-term debt</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-37d.jpg" width="499" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="untb-h1">Contributed capital</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/img-37e.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">Note, the above accounts are listed in the order they would appear on the Balance Sheet. This could also be done using T accounts as follows:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-37f.jpg" width="502" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">Note, the ending balance in cash is a debit of 110 (the debits 220 + 200 less the credit or 310).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_38"></a>We can add up all the debits (220 + 200 + 60 + 310 = 790) and they equal the total credits (310 + 60 + 200 + 220 = 790). We can also net the debits and credits for each account and then calculate the total that gives us: cash 110 + inventory 60 + PP&amp;E 310 = total assets = 480, compared to: accounts payable 60 + long-term debt 200 + contributed capital 220 = total liabilities and owners’ equity = 480. Total debits equal total credits and the Balance Sheet balances.</p>
<p class="indent1">Today, we can instead use a spreadsheet with plusses and minuses instead of debits and credits.<a href="#c3n6" id="ic3n6"><sup>6</sup></a> This leaves a greater chance of making a mistake from an accountant’s point of view but is perhaps easier to follow. The spreadsheet would be done as follows:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-38.jpg" width="493" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent2">The account totals remain the same; only the format is changed. Although some may prefer spreadsheets, it remains important to at least understand debits and credits as virtually all accountants think and talk about accounting in this way. That said, for most of the following discussion, we will use a spreadsheet with plusses and minuses.</p>
<p class="h1">The Income Statement</p>
<p class="noindent">Up to this point, all the transactions illustrated have involved only Balance Sheet accounts (assets, liability and equity accounts). It is now time to consider Income Statement accounts (revenue and expense accounts).</p>
<p class="indent1">The Income Statement links into the Balance Sheet through the retained earnings account. The Income Statement is for a period of time, normally a year, whereas the Balance Sheet is as at an instant in time. At the end of each year, all the Income Statement accounts are reset to zero. The profit or loss is then entered into the retained earnings (R/E) <a id="page_39"></a>account. Thus, once a year, the retained earnings account is increased if the firm had a profit and reduced if the firm had a loss. The retained earnings account is also decreased when any funds are returned to the owners, which are called dividends. This can be stated as an algebraic formula as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Opening R/E + Profit − Loss − Dividends = Ending R/E</p>
<p class="indent1">The Balance Sheet shows the resources a firm owns and controls as well as how the resources were financed at an instant or snapshot in time. On the other hand, the Income Statement, which is also called a Statement of Profit or Loss, shows a firm’s performance and its components over a period of time. The Income Statement contains two broad categories of accounts: revenues (the quantity of items sold or services provided times the price per unit) and expenses (the costs to provide the items sold or services provided). The Income Statement accounts are considered “temporary” accounts as they represent amounts accumulated over a certain period of time (month, quarter, or normally, a year) and are periodically reset to zero. <a href="#exh3.2" id="iexh3.2">Exhibit 3.2</a> provides an example for our hypothetical T-shirt firm.</p>
<p class="image1"><a href="#iexh3.2" id="exh3.2"><img src="../images/ex3.2.jpg" width="489" alt="images"/></a></p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_40"></a>For example, assume 2015 is the first year of operation for the T-shirt firm, which started in January. This means the retained earnings account at the start of 2015 would have been $0 (the firm had no profits or losses at its inception). From the 2015 Income Statement, we see profits of $32,500, and the Balance Sheet retained earnings account has a year-end balance of the same amount. This means that the firm made no distributions to the owners in the first year. <i>How do we know how much the firm distributed to owners?</i> The previous equation has four elements: an opening balance, a profit or loss, a potential distribution to the owners, and an ending balance. With any three, you can compute the fourth using algebra. In other words, fill in what you know and solve for what you do not know.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-40a.jpg" width="496" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent"><i>How much were dividends?</i> They have to be $0 in order for the equation to balance. Therefore, no dividends were paid in 2015.</p>
<p class="indent1">In 2016, the firm starts the year with an opening balance in retained earnings of $32,500. <i>How do you know that?</i> Remember, all Balance Sheet accounts are at a specific instant in time. The amount a firm has at midnight December 31, 2015, will be the same amount it has one second past midnight the morning of January 1, 2016. Hence, the ending balance last year is the opening balance this year. From the 2016 Income Statement, we see profits of $58,500. This means retained earnings started the year at $32,500 and increased by $58,500 bringing the total to $91,000. However, the amount of retained earnings at the end of 2016 is only $80,000. <i>How is this possible?</i> The firm must have paid the owners the difference of $11,000.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-40b.jpg" width="490" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent"><i>How much were dividends?</i> To balance, they must have been $11,000.</p>
<p class="indent2">This is one of the keys to accounting: the math has to work. In the example, we compute dividends as the missing variable. In reality, the <a id="page_41"></a>firm would have the opening balance, the income (or loss), the dividends, and the closing balance. If the math did not work as above ($32,500 + $58,500 − $11,000 = $80,000), it would mean a mistake had been made somewhere. That is how the accounting system, one of check and balances, works.</p>
<p class="h1">Linking the Income Statement into the Balance Sheet</p>
<p class="noindent">The process for how accounting links the Balance Sheet and Income Statement also reflects how accounts are treated. As noted previously, the Balance Sheet accounts are considered “permanent” accounts as they are cumulative over time and represent the account balance <i>as at</i> an instant in time. The Income Statement accounts are considered “temporary” accounts as they represent amounts accumulated <i>over</i> a certain period of time (month, quarter, or normally, a year) and are periodically reset to zero. The Balance Sheet and Income Statement are linked when the Income Statement accounts are reset to zero (called closing the accounts).</p>
<p class="indent1">Back up a bit. <i>How are Income Statement accounts increased and decreased? With a debit or credit?</i> Revenues are increased with a credit because they eventually increase owners’ equity, whereas expenses are increased with a debit as they eventually decrease owners’ equity. Again, the application of credits and debits may seem confusing, but it will become clearer and clearer as you come to understand the accounting process. Let us break down the Balance Sheet Equation as follows:<a href="#c3n7" id="ic3n7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="eq">Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity, where</p>
<p class="eq">Owners’ Equity = Contributed Capital (CC) + Retained Earnings (R/E), where</p>
<p class="eq">R/E = R/E<sub>at the start of the year</sub> + Profit (or −Loss) − Dividends, and</p>
<p class="eq"><a id="page_42"></a>Profit (or Loss) = Revenue − Expenses,</p>
<p class="eq">where there is a profit if Revenues &gt; Expenses (and a loss if Revenue &lt; Expenses).</p>
<p class="indent1">We can rewrite the equation as:</p>
<p class="eq">Assets = Liabilities + CC + R/E<sub>opening amount</sub> + Revenue − Expenses − Dividends.</p>
<p class="indent">The revenue accounts increase the right hand side of the equation. For example, if a T-shirt is sold for $8 cash, the firm increases the cash account by $8 with a debit and the revenue account by $8 with a credit. The cash account is on the left side of the equation, and the revenue account is on the right side of the equation. This means revenue accounts are treated like the liabilities and owners’ equity accounts (increased with credits and decreased with debits). Expenses do the opposite. For example, when the T-shirt is sold, the firm has one less T-shirt on hand. Assume the T-shirt cost $6. The firm would then decrease its T-shirt inventory account by $6 with a credit and increase its Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) by $6 with a debit. This means expenses are treated like assets (increased with debits and decreased with credits).</p>
<p class="indent">This also explains the “as at” for Balance Sheet accounts and the “for the period ending” for Income Statement accounts. The Balance Sheets accounts are a running total. The Income Statement accounts are for a specific period of time and are linked to the Balance Sheet through retained earnings. This link occurs at the end of the accounting period (normally a year) when the Income Statement accounts are reset to zero (closed) with the profit or loss (the difference in the revenues and expenses) entered into the retained earnings account.</p>
<p class="indent">At the end of the period, the Income Statement’s revenue accounts, which would have credit balances from activities during the period, are reduced to zero with debits. The required balancing credit is made to retained earnings, thereby increasing the owners’ equity account on the Balance Sheet.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, the Income Statement’s expense accounts, which would have debit balances, are reduced to zero with credits. The balancing debit is made to retained earnings, thereby reducing the owners’ equity account on the Balance Sheet.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, the Balance Sheet’s retained earnings account is increased when there is a profit (i.e., when revenues exceed expenses) <a id="page_43"></a>and decreased when there is a loss (i.e., when expenses exceed revenues). For simplification, the process involves debiting each revenue account, crediting each expense account, and then making one credit (if a profit) or debit (if a loss) to retained earnings for the net difference in the totals.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, imagine a firm begins the year with retained earnings of $100,000. During the year, the firm has revenues of $60,000 and expenses of $45,000. At the end of the year, before the revenue and expense accounts are reset to zero, the account totals would show:</p>

<p class="indent">Then, at year-end, the revenue and expense accounts would be reset to zero as follows:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/img-43b.jpg" width="500" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">Similarly, any dividends, which are the firm’s distributions to owners, are treated like expenses. The dividend account is increased with debits as the cash payment requires a reduction to the cash account, which is done with a credit. The dividend account is reset to zero at the end of the period with a credit, and the corresponding debit is made to retained earnings. However, dividends do not appear on the Income Statement. There is a third statement, the Statement of Retained Earnings, which shows the change to this account. However, this statement can be easily reconstructed from the Balance Sheet (which gives the opening and closing/ending amounts for retained earnings) and Income Statement (which gives the firm’s profit or loss for the period).<a href="#c3n8" id="ic3n8"><sup>8</sup></a> We only need simple algebra and the amounts from these two statements to solve for the amount of dividends. Using our previous formula:</p>
<p class="eq">R/E<sub>Opening</sub> + Income (−Loss) − Dividends = R/E<sub>Ending</sub></p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_44"></a>“An analogy: Most cars have two standard odometers (which shows miles or kilometers driven): A cumulative odometer (which cannot be reset) shows the total miles driven since the car was made. A trip odometer (which can be reset by pushing a button) reflects the miles driven from the last time the trip odometer was reset. For example, assume the cumulative odometer begins the day with 7,600 miles and the trip odometer shows 0. During the day 140 miles are driven. At the end of the day, before the trip odometer is reset, the cumulative odometer shows 7,740 miles and the trip odometer shows 140. When the trip odometer is reset to zero the cumulative odometer is unchanged. Now imagine an accountant had designed the odometers. Before the trip odometer is reset, the cumulative odometer would be unchanged at 7,600 miles and the trip odometer would show 140 miles. Then, when the reset button is pressed, both odometers would change to 7,740 and 0. In effect, retained earnings on the Balance Sheet does not show cumulative earnings less amounts paid to the owners until the Income Statement accounts are reset to zero.”</p>

<p class="h1">Continuing the T-shirt Seller Example</p>
<p class="noindent1">Let us continue our example of the T-shirt firm, assuming the following additional events in its first year of operations (items 1–5 are on pages 34–35):</p>
<p class="nl">   6.  The firm sells 10,000 T-shirts for $8 each, receiving full payment at the time of sale.</p>
<p class="nl">   7.  The firm pays for the first 10,000 T-shirts and then orders and receives another 60,000 T-shirts for $6 each. By year-end, the firm has paid for all but 12,000 of the T-shirts it purchased during the year.</p>
<p class="nl">   8.  During the rest of the year, the firm sells another 40,000 T-shirts for $8 each, but now gives some customers 30 days to pay. At year-end, the firm has been paid for 30,000 of these T-shirts but is still owed for 10,000 of them.</p>
<p class="nl">   9.  Half way through the year, the firm decides it should get insurance. The insurance firm charges $20,000 for a 1-year insurance policy. The firm pays the full $20,000 on July 1, 2015.</p>
<p class="nl"> 10.  The firm incurs various operating costs during the year, other than the insurance. These other costs include a $10,000 reduction in the value of PP&amp;E (more on this later in the book), $2,000 for advertising, <a id="page_45"></a>and $14,000 for wages. At year-end, the firm has paid the workers $8,500 and still owes them $5,500.</p>
<p class="nl"> 11.  Interest on the debt is paid (at a rate of 7 percent per year).</p>
<p class="nll"> 12.  Estimated taxes (computed at the rate of 35 percent of profit before tax) are paid.</p>
<p class="indent1">The entries to record each of these events are as follows:</p>

<p class="h1">The Bottom Line</p>
<p class="noindent">Debit means to the left. Credit means to the right. The Balance Sheet equation is: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity. Balance Sheet accounts are permanent accounts showing the item’s value as at a point in time. Income Statement accounts are temporary accounts meaning they are reset to zero at the end of each period at which time retained earnings is increased (if there is a profit) or decreased (if there is a loss). These are the basics of the accounting cycle.</p>
<p class="indent2">The next chapter presents the accrual method of accounting, which is what most organizations use, where revenue is recognized when goods or services are provided and expenses are matched to revenues.</p>
<p class="noindent">_________________</p>
<p class="fn" id="c3n1"><a href="#ic3n1"><sup>1</sup></a>The Balance Sheet’s name is usually thought to derive from the requirement of the left side (Assets) equal, or balance, with the right side (Liabilities and Equity). However, it can also be argued that the name derives from the listing of the ending values or “balances” in the accounts.</p>
<p class="fn" id="c3n2"><a href="#ic3n2"><sup>2</sup></a>Balance Sheets can be presented on two pages, with assets on the left page and liabilities and owners’ equity on the right page or, as in <a href="#exh3.1">Exhibit 3.1</a>, on one page with the assets on top and the liabilities and owners’ equity on the bottom.</p>
