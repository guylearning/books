<p class="ct"><a href="06_Contents.xhtml#toc13">Cash Is King</a></p>
<p class="noindent">So far in the book we have been discussing financial statements prepared using accrual accounting, which recognizes revenues when they are earned and then tries to match the related costs to the revenues. Where the costs cannot be matched, they are included in the period in which the costs are incurred. Unfortunately, matching costs and revenues requires numerous estimates and assumptions and is subject to much debate and interpretation.</p>
<p class="indent">There is another, simpler, way to prepare accounting statements. All transactions can be measured in terms of cash flows into a corporation and cash flows out of a corporation. Imagine a firm has only one asset: cash. Revenues occur when cash increases, and expenses occur when cash decreases. Cash is simple, direct, and clear. It can be measured directly and is not subject to the estimates and assumptions of other accounts.<a href="#c11n1" id="ic11n1"><sup>1</sup></a> Cash is straightforward to measure because a firm either has it or does not.</p>
<p class="indent2">Furthermore, finance values investments based on future cash flows. Financial statements provide the starting point to estimate those future cash flows, so anyone interested in valuing a firm should welcome information on how cash moves in and out of a firm.</p>
<p class="h1">Cash Flows</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>How can a firm obtain cash?</i> Four ways:</p>
<p class="bl">    •   By collecting from customers,</p>
<p class="bl">    •   By borrowing funds from lenders,</p>
<p class="bl"><a id="page_154"></a>    •   By obtaining funds from the owners, and</p>
<p class="bll">    •   By collecting on the sale of long-term assets.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>As an outside investor looking at a firm, how would you rank these four possibilities in terms of attractiveness</i>? Finance tells us there is a “pecking order” for the ways of obtaining cash. Internally generated funds are preferred over borrowing, which is preferred over equity issues. This means collecting from customers after selling products or services (and hopefully selling them for more than they cost to produce) would be a firm’s preferred source of cash. Empirical research in finance tells us there is little or no stock market reaction when firms borrow funds (so this would be second), but there is often a negative stock market reaction (share price falls) when a firm issues new equity (making this number three). Selling long-term assets is fine if the resources sold are not needed, otherwise this is the least favorable alternative as it means the firm is either desperate and/or liquidating.</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>What does a firm use cash for?</i> Again, there are four categories:</p>
<p class="bl">    •   Pay suppliers of goods and services,</p>
<p class="bl">    •   Pay back lenders,</p>
<p class="bl">    •   Provide cash distributions to the owners (in dividends or share buybacks), and</p>
<p class="bll">    •   Pay for purchases of long-term assets.</p>
<p class="indent">Here the ranking is not quite as clear. Many firms like to delay paying suppliers because they believe this is free financing. Lenders have to be paid when funds are due, but this can be negotiated. Some owners want cash distributions while others prefer to have the firm continue to invest its funds. And, clearly, if a firm has financially attractive projects to invest in, then the purchase of long-term assets is a good thing.</p>
<p class="indent1">However, regardless of how one ranks these different cash inflows and outflows, it is clear that an outsider should find it informative to not only know the total cash flows in and out of the firm but also have them categorized. The cash flow statement is categorized in the following ways:</p>
<p class="indent">Cash from operations:</p>
<p class="indent">    Cash received from customers</p>
<p class="indent1">    Cash paid to suppliers of goods and services</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_155"></a>Cash from investing:</p>
<p class="indent">    Cash received from the sale of long-term assets</p>
<p class="indent">    Cash paid for the purchase of long-term assets</p>
<p class="indent">    Cash received from the sale of non-operating investments</p>
<p class="indent1">    Cash paid for non-operating investments</p>
<p class="indent">Cash from financing:</p>
<p class="indent">    Cash received from borrowing (new debt issues)</p>
<p class="indent">    Cash received from the owners (issuing new equity)</p>
<p class="indent">    Cash paid to reduce debt</p>
<p class="indent">    Cash given to owners in the form of dividends</p>
<p class="indent1">    Cash given to owners by repurchasing a firm’s own shares</p>
<p class="indent">The total of these three categories (cash from operations, investing, and financing) will exactly match the change in a firm’s cash balance during the year (calculated by taking the cash account at the end of the current year minus the cash account at the end of the prior year).</p>
<p class="indent">The Cash Flow Statement can be prepared by reviewing every transaction in a firm’s cash accounts and then categorizing and presenting them as above. It is simple in concept, but in practice, there may be millions of transactions.</p>
<p class="indent">An analyst evaluating a firm should compare these cash flows to what is expected given the firm’s economic situation. Think of three different firms: Firm A is a young, fast-growing firm; Firm B is a stable firm with flat sales; and Firm C is a firm in decline, slowly liquidating.</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>What is a possible scenario for cash flow by category for each of these three firms?</i></p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-155.jpg" width="492" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent"><i>What might an analyst expect to see in cash from operations?</i> Consider Firm A (growing quickly): Cash received from customers is likely to be <a id="page_156"></a>lower than the cash paid to suppliers. This is because if sales are increasing rapidly, the firm has to fund receivables and inventory. Payables are also likely to increase, but the total increase in payables will probably be less than the total increase in receivables and inventory. Hence, the firm will have a negative cash flow from operations, which means working capital (accounts receivables plus inventory less account payable) is flat or decreasing. By contrast, Firm B is stable and Firm C is declining, so when it comes to cash from operations, we expect these firms to collect more than they are paying.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>What about cash from investing?</i> This should be the same as cash from operations for Firms A and C. We would expect Firm A to be investing in new plant and equipment (cash outflows), whereas Firm C is divesting (cash inflows). Firm B is stable, so it is unclear whether it will grow slightly, continue to be stable, or shrink slightly.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>And what about cash from financing?</i> This is likely to be the opposite of cash from operations. A firm must finance any net decrease in cash from operations and investing. This means Firm A will have to borrow funds and/or issue new equity to obtain funds because the cash it is getting from operations does not cover the cost of the operations (negative cash from operations). By contrast, Firm C is expected to have excess cash from operations and investing, so it can pay down debt and/or return cash to the owners. Firm B is stable or in steady state, so its financing could be slightly positive, or slightly negative.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, our expectations (and the above is far from complete) of where cash flows come from and where it goes depends, at least to some extent, on a firm’s economic life cycle. It is a diagnostic, similar to a doctor taking someone’s blood pressure. Most medical exams begin with taking an individual’s blood pressure because it is used as a diagnostic to determine the subsequent exam.</p>
<p class="indent2">In addition, cash flows will not always meet expectations, and when they do not meet expectations, the reader should endeavor to understand the cause of the difference from expectations. The explanation helps the reader to understand the firm’s business model.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="page_157"></a>The Presentation of Cash from Operations</p>
<p class="noindent">Cash from investing and cash from financing are presented as above. However, cash from operations is normally presented as a reconciliation from net income. In this alternate format, cash from operations starts with net income and then backs out all the noncash accruals, resulting in the same total as derived from adding the cash collected from customers and subtracting the cash paid to suppliers. <i>That’s confusing: Why not just do it as above, by adding the cash collected from customers and subtracting the cash paid to suppliers? Why start with net income and complicate it?</i> The reason is to illustrate why (and how) net income differs from cash from operations. <i>Cannot users just compare the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement themselves?</i> They could, but it is considered more informative to show the reconciliation (i.e., the details of the differences between net income and cash from operations).<a href="#c11n2" id="ic11n2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Some analysts start with an expectation that cash from operations will be equal or greater than net income plus depreciation (depreciation is generally the largest noncash expense). If this expectation is met, it provides a sense of comfort that accounting choices, estimates, and assumptions are not driving net income. Accounting gimmicks may still be present, but they are perhaps less likely. By contrast, if cash from operations is less than net income plus depreciation, there is a greater probability that accounting choices, estimates, and assumptions are driving net income, and the analyst should examine the financial statements and accounting choices more carefully.</p>
<p class="indent2">The order of the Cash Flow Statement’s items normally starts with net income, then depreciation expense, and then other adjustments (often, but not always, these would be listed as cash increases, the debits, and then decreases in cash, the credits).</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="page_158"></a>Cash from Operations</p>
<p class="noindent">Let us examine the components of cash from operations in more detail. We begin using the Balance Sheet and Income Statement to find cash collected from customers.</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>How can you estimate cash from customers using a firm’s Balance Sheet and Income Statement?</i> Take sales and adjust for the change in accounts receivable. Remember that the formula for calculating the year-end receivables account is:</p>
<p class="center">Receivables<sub>start of the year</sub> + Sales − Cash Collections = Receivables<sub>end of the year</sub></p>
<p class="indent1">The Balance Sheet provides the opening and closing amounts for receivables, and the Income Statement provides the sales. We solve for cash collections using simple algebra:</p>
<p class="center">Cash Collections = Sales + Receivables<sub>start of the year</sub> − Receivables<sub>end of the year</sub></p>
<p class="indent1">This amounts to:</p>
<p class="eq">Cash Collections = Sales + a decrease in receivables over the year, or<br/>Cash Collections = Sales − an increase in receivables over the year</p>
<p class="indent">Basically, it is as if the firm collects all the opening receivables, and then collects sales except for the amounts left as ending receivables. If receivables decrease during the year, it means the firm collected more cash than sales. If receivables increase over the year, it means the firm collected less than the current years’ sales.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>How do you find cash paid to suppliers?</i> This is a bit more complicated because it has two parts. First, the total cost of inventory purchased is computed. Second, the amount actually paid (remember, we care about cash paid, not amount purchased) is computed.</p>
<p class="indent1">We find inventory purchases by using the formula for year-end inventory and using algebra to solve for purchases:</p>
<p class="center">Inventory<sub>start of the year</sub> + Purchases − Cost of Goods Sold = Inventory<sub>end of the year</sub></p>
<p class="eq1"><a id="page_159"></a>Purchases = Cost of Goods Sold + Inventory<sub>end of the year</sub> − Inventory<sub>start of the year</sub></p>
<p class="eq1">Purchases = Cost of Goods Sold + an increase in inventory, or</p>
<p class="eq">Purchases = Cost of Goods Sold − a decrease in inventory</p>
<p class="indent1">Next, we find the amount actually paid by using the formula for year-end payables:</p>
<p class="eq1">Payables<sub>start of the year</sub> + Purchases − Cash Payments = Payables<sub>end of the year</sub></p>
<p class="eq1">Cash Payments = Purchases + Payables<sub>start of the year</sub> − Payables<sub>end of the year</sub></p>
<p class="eq1">Cash Payments = Purchases – an increase in payables over the year, or</p>
<p class="eq">Cash Payments = Purchases + a decrease in payables over the year</p>
<p class="indent"><i>What are the implications of one of the variables changing, like payables or inventory?</i> Holding inventory constant means purchases = cost of goods sold (essentially, newly purchased inventory exactly replaces the inventory that is sold during the year). Holding payables constant means the firm pays for exactly what was purchased. Holding both inventory and payables constant means the firm paid for cost of goods sold (or cash out = cost of goods sold).</p>
<p class="indent"><i>What happens if inventory changes but payables do not?</i> Holding payables constant: If inventory increases, it means the firm has purchased and paid more than cost of goods sold. If inventory decreases, it means the firm has purchased and paid less than cost of goods sold.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>What if payables change but inventory does not?</i> If payables increase, it means the firm has paid less than the cost of goods sold (more unpaid bills means less cash out). If payables decrease, it means the firm has paid more than cost of goods sold (less unpaid bills means more cash out).</p>
<p class="indent1">And what if both inventory and payables change?</p>
<p class="eq">Cash Payments = Cost of Goods Sold + an increase in inventory – a decrease in inventory + a decrease in payables − an increase in payables</p>
<p class="indent2"><i>Are we done?</i> Not quite. Changes in other current assets (e.g., prepaid expenses) and other current liabilities (e.g., accrued expenses) indicate that there are expenses recorded on the Income Statement that are not <a id="page_160"></a>equal to cash paid. In this case, an adjustment similar to the one made for cost of goods sold is required (the adjustment taking payables into account) as shown in the next section.</p>
<p class="h1">An Illustration</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a href="#exh11.1" id="iexh11.1">Exhibits 11.1</a> and <a href="#exh11.2" id="iexh11.2">11.2</a> present a simple Balance Sheet and Income Statement.</p>

<p class="image1"><a href="#iexh11.2" id="exh11.2"><img src="../images/ex11.2.jpg" width="492" alt="images"/></a></p>
<p class="indent"> </p>
<p class="h1"><a id="page_161"></a>Computing Cash from Operations</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-161a.jpg" width="490" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Why is depreciation ignored in the above calculation?</i> Because it did not involve an outlay of cash. Likewise, the gain on sale of property, plant, and equipment (PP&amp;E) is ignored as it also did not involve any cash. Wait a minute. <i>If PP&amp;E was sold, would there not be some cash received?</i> Yes, but the cash received, all of it, is included under cash from investments. Remember, the Cash Flow Statement cares only about cash transactions, whereas the Income Statement includes noncash items (such as depreciation expense and gains on sale of PP&amp;E).</p>
<p class="indent1">The above is the direct computation of cash from operations. However, as noted, what is normally presented in a Cash Flow Statement is an indirect computation that shows how to reconcile (adjust) net income to cash from operations. This would be done as follows:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-161b.jpg" width="496" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">Note that cash from operations is the same number under both the presentations above. It has to be. If it is not, it means . . . you have made a mistake! That is the beauty of accounting.</p>
<p class="indent2">Both methods result in the same cash from operations, and firms can elect either approach. Arguably, the indirect method is preferred because it <a id="page_162"></a>provides the link between net income and cash from operations. However, if a firm chooses the direct method, it must also provide a supplemental presentation of using the indirect method. By contrast, if a firm chooses the indirect method, it is not required to provide supplemental information using the direct method (i.e., it is one and done). Thus, it may not be surprising that the vast majority of public firms elect the indirect method.</p>
<p class="h1">Computing Cash from Investing</p>
<p class="noindent2">Now let us do cash from investing. As noted above, cash from investing is (a) cash received from the sale of long-term assets and non-operating investments and (b) cash paid for the purchase of long-term assets and non-operating investments. <i>How do we compute the amounts for cash from investing?</i> First, we need to determine if a long-term asset or investment was sold or purchased. Second, we have to determine the amount received or paid.</p>
<p class="h2">Determining Whether a Long-Term Asset or Investment was Sold or Purchased</p>
<p class="noindent">Using our illustration above: <i>Were any assets sold?</i> Yes. <i>How do we know?</i> This would be information a firm would already have. However, outsiders might find this information in the Notes to the Financial Statements or perhaps with a gain or loss on the sale of PP&amp;E being itemized on the Income Statement, as in our current example with <a href="#exh11.2">Exhibit 11.2</a>. (If there is a gain or loss on the sale, it means something was sold.) Additionally, we can use the algebraic equations for PP&amp;E and its accumulated depreciation accounts to determine if anything was purchased or sold.</p>
<p class="nll">   1.  The equation to calculate the year-end value of PP&amp;E for the Balance Sheet:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-162a.jpg" width="487" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="nll">   2.  The equation used to calculate the year-end value of accumulated depreciation for the Balance Sheet:</p>
<p class="image1" id="page_163"><img src="../images/img-163a.jpg" width="494" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">Inputting the numbers found in <a href="#exh11.1">Exhibits 11.1</a> and <a href="#exh11.2">11.2</a> gives us:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-163b.jpg" width="502" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">The PP&amp;E formula (i.e., what happens to the PP&amp;E account from the start of the year to the end of the year) shows us whether something was purchased: PP&amp;E increases from $500 at the start of the year to $640 at the end, so clearly something was purchased (it could not have increased if there was only a disposal). By itself (without additional information as discussed below), the equation does not provide the cost of assets sold or purchased.</p>
<p class="indent">The accumulated depreciation formula gives evidence of whether anything was sold. If nothing was sold (or the item sold had no accumulated depreciation), then the accumulated depreciation account would increase by exactly the depreciation expense. Here accumulated depreciation increases by $10 less than depreciation expense (depreciation expense was $50 but accumulated depreciation increased by $40). This means the item sold had accumulated depreciation of $10.</p>
<p class="indent2">Besides using the equations above, we can determine if something was sold by looking at the Income Statement: If the Income Statement lists a gain or loss on the sale of PP&amp;E, it means something must have been <a id="page_164"></a>sold. However, if there is no gain or loss, it could be that the item was sold for book value or that the gain or loss was small and combined with another amount when listed on the Income Statement. Thus, knowing how to use the equations above is still important.</p>
<p class="h2">Determining the Amount of Cash Received or Paid for the Asset Sold or Purchased</p>
<p class="noindent">The two equations above tell us whether a long-term asset was sold or purchased and the amount of accumulated depreciation on assets sold. However, to determine the cost of PP&amp;E sold requires additional information on the amount paid for PP&amp;E during the year, which should be available in the Notes to the Financial Statements.</p>
<p class="indent1">Once the cost of PP&amp;E is computed, the cash received from the sale of PP&amp;E is determined by adding a gain or subtracting a loss from the net book value (the cost of PP&amp;E sold minus the accumulated depreciation on PP&amp;E sold). For example, assume the Notes to the Financial Statements indicate the firm purchased new PP&amp;E for $300. This means the original cost of the PP&amp;E sold was $160 (PP&amp;E<sub>start</sub> + purchases of PP&amp;E − PP&amp;E<sub>end</sub> = $500 + $300 − $640 = cost of PP&amp;E sold). We have already computed the accumulated depreciation on the asset(s) sold as $10. This means the net book value (cost − accumulated depreciation) of the PP&amp;E sold was $150. The gain on the sale as listed on the Income Statement was $12.<a href="#c11n3" id="ic11n3"><sup>3</sup></a> Thus, the cash received was $162 ($150 + $12), using the logic that:</p>
<p class="center">Cash received from sale = net book value of asset + gain from sale (or − loss from sale)</p>
<p class="indent1">The accounting entry would be:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-164.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_165"></a>We can now prepare the cash from investing section of the Cash Flow Statement:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-165a.jpg" width="501" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent2">Note that in the cash from operations, we removed (subtracted) the gain of $12 because it is a noncash item that is included in net income, but not in cash from operations. The gain is included in cash from investing as part of the total cash proceeds received on the sale (which in this case is the full recovery of the net book value of $150 plus the $12 gain for a total of $162). Not reducing this amount in cash from operations would have effectively counted the $12 gain twice.</p>
<p class="h1">Computing Cash from Financing</p>
<p class="noindent1">Finally, we compute cash from financing by looking at the changes in debt and equity as follows:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-165b.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">Note that in the example above, the amount shown is the net cash from issuing new debt and the net cash from issuing new equity. In fact, the amounts should be separated (as shown at the start of this chapter) into cash paid to retire debt and cash received from new debt as well as cash paid to repurchase shares and cash received from issuing new shares. As with PP&amp;E, these specifics can be computed only with additional information (ignored here for simplicity).</p>
<p class="indent1">To compute the cash dividends paid, we return to the algebra of the retained earnings account:</p>
<p class="image1" id="page_166"><img src="../images/img-166a.jpg" width="494" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">The “dividends” amount above is in fact dividends declared. However, if any declared dividends had not been paid at year-end, there would be a dividends payable account (a liability) and any increase (decrease) in dividends payable would reduce (increase) the cash dividends paid. Thus, the cash paid for dividends is:</p>
<p class="center">Cash dividends paid = dividends + dividends payable<sub>start of the year</sub> − dividends payable<sub>end of the year</sub></p>
<p class="indent"> </p>
<p class="h1">Putting the Cash Flow Statement Together</p>
<p class="noindent1">Putting the three sections together we have:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-166b.jpg" width="507" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_167"></a>Once again, the math works (if it does not, it means there is a mistake).</p>
<p class="indent2"><i>How could this Cash Flow Statement be interpreted?</i> Perhaps this is an established firm, which is still growing. The firm is throwing off cash from operations but not enough to finance its new investment in PP&amp;E, so the firm still has to obtain funds from debt and equity. Without the new investment in PP&amp;E (net PP&amp;E is substantially more than the depreciation expense, reflecting a growing firm), the firm would have enough cash from operations to pay all its dividends and still pay down some debt or buy back some shares. Because the firm does not have enough cash from operations to fund the new PP&amp;E and still chooses to pay dividends, it requires even more financing than it would otherwise.</p>
<p class="h1">A Few Additional Points</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>How is the category (operations, investing, or financing) for each item determined?</i> It is based on the nature of the account. <i>Is the account related to operations, purchasing new PP&amp;E, or financing activities?</i> Receivables, inventory, prepaid expenses, payables, and accruals are all part of operations. It is also a convention (as noted above) to start with net income and have depreciation listed second, followed by the others (often listing the debits first and the credits second, but this is not required).</p>
<p class="indent">As a rule of thumb, changes in assets can only be operations or investing (and current assets are usually in operations with the exception of short-term investments, which are not part of operations and are therefore included in cash from investing). Liabilities and equity accounts can only be in operations or financing (and again, short-term items are normally in operations).</p>
<p class="indent">Note that firms create their Cash Flow Statements by examining their cash accounts. This means a Cash Flow Statement created by an outsider using the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and some limited additional information may not exactly match what the firm prepares.</p>
<p class="indent2"><a id="page_168"></a>One last point: In the United States, interest expense is included in cash from operations (it is included in net income and no adjustment is required). In most European countries, interest expense is included in cash from financing (so it must be added back to or canceled out of net income and then reduced in cash from financing). There are often similar minor differences across countries.</p>
<p class="h1">Free Cash Flow</p>
<p class="noindent">Many people incorrectly think that cash from operations is the same as the finance concept of free cash flow.<a href="#c11n4" id="ic11n4"><sup>4</sup></a> The two are not the same.</p>
<p class="indent">Free cash flow is usually computed as the net cash flow generated by a firm’s assets or by its asset-based activities. It is the total cash available for distribution to the creditors and owners after funding all worthwhile investment activities. This is NOT the same thing as cash from operations, which is the cash received from customers and paid to suppliers.</p>
<p class="indent1">The computation of free cash flow in finance is:</p>
<p class="center">EBIT × (1 − <i>t</i><sub>c</sub>) + Depreciation Expense − Change in Working Capital − Net Capital Expenditures,</p>
<p class="noindent1">where EBIT stands for Earnings before interest and taxes, <i>t</i><sub>c</sub> stands for the corporate taxation rate, and</p>
<p class="noindent2">Change in working capital = change in receivables + change in inventories − change in payables</p>
<p class="h1">The Bottom line</p>
<p class="noindent">While cash flows do represent a truth (the firm has the cash or it does not) they are subject to manipulation by altering the underlying economics (speeding up or delaying cash flows). By itself, the cash flow statement is not as informative as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement. <a id="page_169"></a>Combined with the other statements, understanding the cash flows provides an additional tool in understanding the economics of a firm.</p>
<p class="indent2">The next chapter begins to bring all the numbers together using ratio analysis as a starting point to diagnose a firm’s health and determine its key economic drivers. It ends this volume. But first, Appendix 11A presents a simplified method for an outsider to produce cash flow statements.</p>
