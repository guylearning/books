<p class="noindent">Long-term assets are generally divided into three broad groups: long-term marketable securities; property, plant, and equipment (PP&amp;E); and other assets. The accounting choices for long-term marketable securities are either the same as the choices for short-term marketable securities and merely have a different classification, or are much more complex.<a href="#c6n1" id="ic6n1"><sup>1</sup></a> Long-term marketable securities will be discussed in Accounting for Fun and Profit: Understanding Advanced Topics in Accounting. This chapter will focus on PP&amp;E and intangible assets.</p>
<p class="indent1">As can be seen from the information below, in its 2015 fiscal year, Apple Inc. generated $233.7 billion in revenue and $53.4 billion in profit with total assets of $290.5 billion. The total assets were split between $89.4 billion of current assets and $201.1billion of long-term assets. The long-term assets included $164.1 billion of long-term marketable securities (remember that these are classified as long-term because Apple does not intend to sell them within a year); $22.5 billion of PP&amp;E; and $13.5 billion of other assets. <a href="ch12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> will delve into the numerous ways that exist to relate accounting numbers to each other, but for now, we can note that Apple generated $10.39 in revenue and $2.37 in profit for each dollar of year-end PP&amp;E. By contrast, in its 2015 calendar year, ExxonMobil Corporation generated $1.07 in revenue and $0.06 in profit per dollar of PP&amp;E. Apple (a computer/cell phone firm) required much less in PP&amp;E than Exxon (an energy supplier) to generate each dollar of revenue.</p>

<p class="h1">PP&amp;E<a href="#c6n2" id="ic6n2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">As with any asset, when a firm acquires PP&amp;E (i.e., gains the physical custody or title to it) an asset is increased and either cash is reduced or a liability (accounts payable or debt) is increased (or there is a combination of the two if a partial payment is made). The cost of PP&amp;E includes all legal fees, transportation, and even the costs of setting the equipment up for its first use, if such a cost is significant. If a firm builds the PP&amp;E asset, its cost includes all actual expenditures incurred through completion of construction, even financing cost. <i>What if a firm exchanges one of its assets plus some cash for another, similar to an individual trading in an old car for a new one plus an additional cash payment?</i> The new asset is valued at its estimated cash price.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, firms try to match costs to the revenues that the expenses helped produce. However, property (i.e., land) is recorded at cost and then normally kept at cost. <i>Why is the cost of land not matched to the revenue it helps the firm produce?</i> Because land is a unique geographic location, a spot on the globe, and not thought to deteriorate or change over time. <i>Is the cost of land ever changed?</i> Temporary changes in market value are ignored because the market value of land, unlike an actively traded <a id="page_89"></a>security, is highly subjective. However, if there is a permanent decline in value, the firm will reduce the value on the Balance Sheet and recognize a loss because of this reduction on the Income Statement. For example, if a firm owned land beside an ocean, and the land eroded, the value would have to be written down. Or perhaps the firm owns land in a foreign country, which expropriates the land, then a loss must be recognized. <i>Can the value of land ever be increased above cost?</i> Yes, it is possible by using a mark-to-market valuation (discussed in Accounting for Fun and Profit: Understanding Advanced Topics in Accounting), but it is very rare for firms to choose this option.</p>
<p class="indent">The cost of plant and equipment (e.g., buildings and machinery) is matched to revenue. <i>How can you match the cost of an asset that lasts for years to the revenue of a single year?</i> There are two general approaches, both somewhat arbitrary. One reduces the value evenly over time, whereas the other has higher amounts in the early years and lower amounts in the later years.</p>
<p class="indent1">For example, imagine a firm purchases a car for $40,000 cash at the start of its second year of operations (automobile up $40,000, cash down $40,000). At the end of the year, the firm estimates (a management guess based on experience) that the asset will be reduced evenly over say the next 5 years from $40,000 at the start of year 2 to $10,000 at the end of year 6. The annual reduction is $6,000 a year, and $10,000 is the “salvage value” of the car, meaning the estimated sale value of the asset at the end of its useful life. <i>How do you know by how much to reduce plant or equipment each year?</i> This is computed by taking the initial cost of the asset less the salvage value, with the difference being divided by the length of the useful life. In our example, that would be the $40,000 initial cost minus a $10,000 salvage value divided by 5 years. The annual reduction is called depreciation if it relates to a tangible asset (one you can touch), depletion if on a natural resource (e.g., a mine or timberland), and amortization if on an intangible asset (e.g., a patent, copyright, and so on).</p>
<p class="center">Annual Depreciation = (Cost − Salvage)/Life</p>
<p class="indent1">This method is called straight-line depreciation because, as shown in <a href="#exh6.1" id="iexh6.1">Exhibit 6.1</a>, the value declines in a straight-line over time. This is by far the most common method used by firms for financial reporting. It is simple to compute and understand and has an income smoothing effect.</p>
<p class="image1" id="page_90"><a href="#iexh6.1" id="exh6.1"><img src="../images/ex6.1.jpg" width="490" alt="images"/></a></p>
<p class="indent">A potential critique of the straight-line method is that it does not match how the asset actually deteriorates over time. There are many different methods where the reduction is meant to match how the asset actually declines in value, with higher amounts in the early years and lower amounts in the later years. These methods compute a rate which is applied to the undepreciated balance of the asset. The most popular of these methods is called double declining balance because it creates an annual rate using a numerator of 200 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">Annual Depreciation = (Cost − Accumulated Depreciation to date) × 200%/Life of Asset</p>
<p class="indent1">Using the same example as above, the rate would be 40 percent (200%/5-year life). The depreciation in each of the 5 years is then computed as:</p>
<p class="eq">Year 1 = $16,000 = the initial cost of $40,000 × 40%</p>
<p class="eq">Year 2 = $9,600 = the remaining balance of ($40,000 − $16,000) × 40%,</p>
<p class="eq">Year 3 = $5,760 = the remaining balance of ($24,000 − $9,600) × 40%,</p>
<p class="eq">Year 4 = $3,456 = the remaining balance of ($14,400 − $5,760) × 40%, and</p>
<p class="eq">Year 5 = $2,074 = the remaining balance of ($8,640 − $3,456) × 40%</p>
<p class="indent1">As shown in <a href="#exh6.2" id="iexh6.2">Exhibit 6.2</a>, the graph has a steeper slope in the early years and then levels off.</p>
<p class="image1" id="page_91"><a href="#iexh6.2" id="exh6.2"><img src="../images/ex6.2.jpg" width="490" alt="images"/></a></p>
<p class="indent">Note that the double declining balance method does not include a salvage value in the computation because, implicitly, the ending value after depreciation done in this way is the salvage value.<a href="#c6n3" id="ic6n3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">It is important to note that neither of these methods is meant to value the asset. Both are meant to match a cost to the revenue. The difference between the methods is whether the cost is spread out evenly over time or has a higher amount in the early years. In fact, the economic value of the asset may be higher or lower than the accounting value. Unlike current assets, long-term assets, such as plant and equipment, are not normally adjusted up or down to market values. Accounting is relating the historical cost of the asset (i.e., what the firm incurred) to the revenues that the asset helps the firm generate.</p>
<p class="indent2"><a id="page_92"></a><i>How does a firm estimate the life of an asset and its salvage value?</i> As with all estimates, past experience, industry averages, and management’s beliefs are used here. Normally, the longest life used is 40 years. However, there are many assets (e.g., buildings) that have lives much longer than 40 years. <i>What happens when the asset lasts longer than the estimate used for the depreciation?</i> By incorrectly estimating the asset’s life at less than its actual, a firm records too high a depreciation expense over the estimated life and then nothing in the final years of the asset’s use. Once the asset is reduced to its salvage value, the computation stops and there is no further depreciation expense, even though the asset is still in use. This means that all else equal, accounting profits in future years will be higher because there is no longer a reduction from depreciation. Remember, depreciation is an expense spreading the cost of an asset out over its useful, revenue-generating life. If the asset is fully depreciated but is still in use, there is no additional depreciation allocation for the original asset and the firm does not yet have the depreciation cost of a replacement. However, it is important to remember that what increases in this case is the accounting (not economic) profit based on the accounting deprecation.</p>
<p class="h1">An Accountant in Paris</p>
<p class="noindent">Once upon a time, (around 1990) there was a hypothetical large firm located in the center of Paris, France. The firm had an accounting profit of roughly $5 million<a href="#c6n4" id="ic6n4"><sup>4</sup></a> a year, more or less, over the prior 10 years. Then, the firm received an offer of $100 million for its 80-year-old plant. The buyer did not really want the old dilapidated plant. The buyer wanted the land the plant was on. The selling firm accepted the offer and built a new state-of-the-art plant just outside Paris for $50 million. <i>How much profit (ignoring taxes) did the firm make in the year it accepted the offer?</i> (Try to answer before reading on.)</p>
<p class="indent">About $105 million. The firm probably still made the regular $5 million, and it also had a gain of close to $100 million on the sale of the old plant. The gain on the sale of the plant is the selling price less the <a id="page_93"></a>accounting value at the time of sale. <i>Does it matter what the plant’s original cost was 80 years ago?</i> It does not matter because 80 years later, at the time of sale, the accounting value would have been close to zero. The building would have been reduced to zero (assuming there is no salvage value) on the Balance Sheet 40 years earlier (e.g., the plant was 80 years old and the longest depreciation period is normally 40 years). The only value on the Balance Sheet would have been for the land, at its cost from 80 years ago because land is usually kept at its original cost. The gain on the sale is $100 million less the original cost of the land 80 years ago.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>What about the purchase of the new plant? Does that not reduce the profit?</i> Yes, but only by the depreciation and only once the plant is in operation. The accounting for the new plant is asset up $50 million, cash down $50 million.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>What is the profit the next year?</i> (Again, try to answer before reading on.)</p>
<p class="indent">About $3.75 million. The firm probably made close to the $5 million it made with the old plant, maybe a bit more if the new plant is more efficient. However, the firm now has depreciation expense from the new plant. The amount, using the straight-line method, would be the initial cost of the plant divided by 40 years ($50 million/40), if we assume there is no salvage value. This would mean a depreciation cost of $1.25 million per year.</p>
<p class="indent">The firm then fired its plant manager. According to the accounting records, he had been making about $5 million a year with virtually no investment in PP&amp;E. Then he had a spectacular year making $105 million (21 times his prior 10-year average). This was followed by a truly horrible year of only $3.75 million and this last profit was made after investing $50 million in PP&amp;E. This represents a meager return of 7.5 percent ($3.75/$50), well below what the firm could have earned by investing in risk-free government bonds (in 1990 governments bonds were paying well above 10 percent).</p>
<p class="indent2">As with the “Accountant in Dallas” example in the prior chapter, accounting is not about economic profit. The manager was not making an economic profit of $5 million. There was an economic cost in using the plant. Also, despite the accounting records showing virtually no investment in PP&amp;E, the old plant did have a value (just not in the accounting records). Perhaps it was the wrong decision to build the new plant because it provided insufficient returns.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="page_94"></a>Back to Accounting for PP&amp;E</p>
<p class="noindent">The accounting records will have a separate account for each long-term asset, which the firm tracks. In fact, each long-term asset will have two separate Balance Sheet accounts: one for the cost of the asset and one for the total depreciation to date, which is called accumulated depreciation. Note that the second account is a contra (or negative) asset account similar to the allowance for doubtful accounts (ADA) attached to accounts receivable. The accumulated depreciation account shows the total depreciation taken from the date the assets were purchased through the Balance Sheet date. Thus, the net accounting value of the asset is the cost less the accumulated depreciation account. The individual annual depreciation expenses are temporary accounts on the Income Statement and are reset to zero each year.</p>
<p class="indent1">Using straight-line depreciation in the automobile example above, the accounts would appear as follows in the first 3 years: net PP&amp;E (cost less accumulated depreciation) would be $34,000 ($40,000 − $6,000), $28,000 ($40,000 − $12,000), and $22,000 ($40,000 − $18,000), respectively.<a href="#c6n5" id="ic6n5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-94.jpg" width="501" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="image1" id="page_95"><img src="../images/img-95.jpg" width="500" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1"><i>What happens if there is a change in an estimate?</i> Changes are done prospectively; there is no retroactive adjustment. Assume in our example above that the firm realizes at the start of year 4 that the asset will last 4 more years (7 years in total) and have a final salvage value of $2,000. No adjustment is made for years 1, 2, and 3. The numbers provided were the best estimates at the time. However, at the start of year 4, the asset has an accounting value of $22,000 (the cost of $40,000 less the accumulated depreciation of $18,000). The straight-line depreciation for years 4 to 7 is calculated at $5,000 ([$22,000 − $2,000]/4). In other words, the firm can recalculate depreciation for the additional years of useful life using the asset’s accounting value at the time the firm discovered it had underestimated its life. The formula can be restated as:</p>
<p class="eq">Annual Depreciation = (Accounting value − Salvage)/Remaining Life</p>
<p class="indent">Note that with double declining balance, the rate would be changed to 50 percent (200%/4) applied to the remaining net balance (Cost − Accumulated Depreciation).</p>
<p class="indent">Also note that the life does not have to be time related (years or months). Other common examples would be machine hours (how many hours will the machine be used before it is scrapped or sold) and miles (how many miles will the car be driven before it is sold).</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, depreciation is normally prorated for assets purchased during the year (e.g., if the asset was purchased on March 1 for a firm with a calendar year-end, the first calendar year would have 10/12 of a full year’s depreciation and the last calendar year would receive 2/12).<a href="#c6n6" id="ic6n6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_96"></a>Finally, as noted above, the concept of depreciation can be applied to natural resources (called depletion) and intangible assets (called amortization). For natural resources, the life would normally not be time but rather the quantity of the estimated resource (trees for a timberland, barrels of oil for an oil well, and so on). For intangibles, the life is normally time and the maximum is the remaining life of the patent, copyright, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent2">However, for intangibles, there is an additional wrinkle. If the firm develops or creates the intangible (e.g., discovers a new medicine and patents it), there is often no cost to be reduced because the costs of research and development (R&amp;D) are normally expensed as they occur. This means that firms usually only amortize intangibles when they have purchased them whole from someone else (i.e., when there was an initial purchase cost to amortize over time). Then it is cash down and asset up followed by the reduction (amortization) matched to revenues. This is why some firms like pharmaceuticals have losses for years followed by spectacular profits (or bankruptcy); they do not spread the costs of R&amp;D over time to match revenues. By contrast, exploration for natural resources can be capitalized (cash down, asset up) depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p class="h1">Other Noncurrent Assets</p>
<p class="noindent2">As with “other current assets,” these are miscellaneous items which by themselves are not large enough to merit their own line on the Balance Sheet. It can include intangible items, long-term prepayments, and advances to officers.</p>
<p class="h1">The Bottom Line</p>
<p class="noindent">Accounting tries to match expenditures on long-term assets to the revenues these assets help produce, similar to how it tries to match uncollected receivables and inventory to revenues. To do so requires assumptions and estimates, as well as a choice of accounting technique. This results in a less-than-perfect match, and provides another example of why accounting numbers do not reflect economic reality. Also, as will be discussed in <a href="ch11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> on cash flows, it is useful to remember that it is the payment for the long-term assets that cause a cash outlay, not the following depreciation expense.</p>
<p class="indent2">The next chapter moves to the other side of the Balance Sheet and examines short-term liabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent">_________________</p>
<p class="fn" id="c6n1"><a href="#ic6n1"><sup>1</sup></a>As noted in the last chapter, the classification as long-term is based both on intent (that the firm does not intend to sell the securities within the next year) as well as the assets useful life.</p>
<p class="fn" id="c6n2"><a href="#ic6n2"><sup>2</sup></a>Taken from the firms’ annual 10-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Comission (SEC).</p>
<p class="fn" id="c6n3"><a href="#ic6n3"><sup>3</sup></a>In some computations, the depreciation stops when the salvage value is met. For example, assuming a salvage value of $10,000, the depreciation in year 3 would be $4,400 and there would be no additional depreciation in years 4 and 5.</p>
<p class="fn" id="c6n4"><a href="#ic6n4"><sup>4</sup></a>The original story had the firm earning 20 million French Francs, which have been converted to US dollars.</p>
<p class="fn" id="c6n5"><a href="#ic6n5"><sup>5</sup></a>When the depreciation expense is reduced (reset) to zero at the end of the year (with a credit), the retained earnings account (part of owners’ equity) is also reduced (with a debit).</p>
<p class="fn" id="c6n6"><a href="#ic6n6"><sup>6</sup></a>At one point, to simplify the calculation, firms would, regardless of the actual date the asset was placed into service, record a full year’s depreciation in the year of purchase and nothing in the final year or alternatively record half a year’s depreciation in the year of purchase and half a year’s depreciation in the final year. Today, with the ease of computing the pro-rating it is hard to justify this practice.</p>
