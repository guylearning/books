<p class="para"><strong><span class="dropcap">A</span></strong>s much as I know about the need to stretch mentally, I, too, had to face a challenge. As I went through the process of increasing my use of technology and computers, I became more aware of the walls that I had built up over the years. When it came to making more effective use of the technology tools that I had available, these walls got in the way. I had become so accustomed to my way of working and was so sensitive to avoiding systems that required me to learn a different language, rules, and processes that I found myself becoming exasperated by operating systems that required you to follow, in detail, the platform’s proprietary process steps. If you didn’t know the next step and did not comply, you’d be stuck—so I’d find myself either just sitting there or ending up someplace I hadn’t expected to be. It was maddening. I would become irritated, even incensed, by the often counterintuitive processes that were required in order to perform seemingly straightforward tasks. Once I had mastered one of these tasks, it seemed that I then had to change to a new operating system! It all seemed like too much effort! Over the course of nearly 60 years, I had erected walls that prevented me from building the facility I needed and wanted in my technology usage. I was trying, in essence, to speak in a language I’d never learned.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_378"></a>One night I observed my grandchildren, Chris, Karim, and Selim, doing their homework on their computers. They weren’t bothered at all by the technology—in fact, it was helpful to them. I suppose a major reason is they had had neither the time nor the inclination to build walls before they started learning how to use the various systems they interacted with. Because they had never known another way, they did not have the annoyance of learning a new way to get the results they were looking for, and so there was no fear or irritation getting in the way of their accomplishing their task. From texting to social media to new apps and devices, it was all intriguing and miraculous, and they quickly adapted to and adopted them.</p>

<p class="indent">One conclusion is that walls are a great deal easier to build than they are to tear down. But walls are not likely to be built at all if the pathway to successful outcomes is magical, intriguing, and fun. It’s clear that the newest technical pathways that emerge almost every day are much more readily available to children than they are to adults. That’s why children can program a brand-new phone without hesitation, while we get frustrated, and may even give up, especially if it is a different operating system than we are used to. I would surmise that much of the world’s adult population is easily frustrated by the counterintuitive procedures that are built into so many of the products they try to use. Children, on the other hand, have not developed barriers to making these new, often complex, but useful devices work. Apparently, to children and young adults, the means justify the ends. For many adults, the means prevent the ends from ever happening. Whether it is tackling a new type of tablet, learning how to fly a drone, or installing a high-tech new remote smart system for your home, it all requires learning—and that means change.</p>

<h4 class="h4a">Can People Change?</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Can people change? Yes. But it’s not always easy, as we discussed in <a class="nounder" href="ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>. Most of us are largely a result of what’s happened to us. Converting that to percentages, it is my belief, from years of pondering this issue, that on the average, about 70 percent of who we are is the result of nurture—what we <a id="page_379"></a>have experienced—rather than nature. Of course, in the final analysis, it must be both nature and nurture. But if my theory is right, most of us have about a 70 percent chance of changing <em>if the conditions are right</em>. Even if you consider what much of the current academic thinking on nature versus nurture suggests—a 50/50 split—that is still a message of hope! There are many circumstances under which the conditions for change can be right. Here is a list of what I think are the most important instigators for change:</p>
<p class="numberlist2">1. The individual wants to change.</p>
<p class="numberlist2">2. The individual’s job changes radically.</p>
<p class="numberlist2">3. The individual becomes a parent.</p>
<p class="numberlist2">4. The individual undergoes a significant values shift because of a life-changing experience.</p>
<p class="numberlist2">5. The individual experiences significant learning.</p>
<p class="numberlist2">6. The individual loses a job and must find a new one.</p>
<p class="numberlist2b">7. The individual is being mentored or coached.</p>
<p class="indent">This is just a sampling of the many reasons why people might change. But for this section, let’s look just at businesspeople and the role that Whole Brain Thinking can play in bringing about needed change in several common business situations.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Nothing in progression can rest on its original plan. We might as well think of rocking a grown man in the cradle of an infant.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Edmund Burke</strong></p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4a">When Overcoming Mental Blind Spots</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are plenty of developmental opportunities offered throughout the world. There are resources that will provide almost anything that you might want, from technical training to creativity training, leadership training, empathy training, organization development, and other types of business training across all functions. Essentially, whatever your need is, there will be books, blogs, apps, videos, other online content, programs, or activities available. A first step in the process is that individuals need to be motivated to seek out these materials and find the time and energy to experience them.</p>
<p class="indent">In my own case, I revealed a lower preference in the C-quadrant feeling area, so I took five weekend seminars offered by the Esalen Institute, located in Big Sur, California. These experiences helped me become comfortable in my own skin with my feelings and more effective in my interpersonal <a id="page_380"></a>relationships. They allowed me to become less inhibited and more open and imaginative. Not only was I a better person for it, but I was more effective in my work.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">The final forming of a person’s character lies in their own hands.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Anne Frank</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">I think most people instinctively know when they have a deficit in their array of thinking options, and I also believe that many people want to fill that deficit with useful forms of mental processing. For many people, it’s uncomfortable to be “incomplete.” Often this feeling of incompleteness can be partially satisfied through marriage or partnership, where we seek out a partner who complements us. But for those of us who truly want to develop ourselves, the feeling of completeness is internal. For example, like me, there are people who may realize that they are avoiding dealing with emotional issues; they aren’t letting their feelings come to the surface in a relationship, in a conversation, or in a business situation. I became so intrigued with the techniques and processes used by the Esalen Institute that I talked about those experiences with my family, my business associates, and my direct reports. They were all fascinated. In retrospect, I discovered that my talking about emotions, feelings, and interpersonal relationships had helped break down the walls that had been built up during my adolescence and went a long way toward freeing me from those self-imposed and self-limiting beliefs and constraints.</p>
<h4 class="h4">When High Unemployment, Downsizing, or Layoffs Occur</h4>
<p class="noindent">Being downsized or laid off is another issue that all too many businesspeople are facing during these times of downturns, reorganizations, and organizational flattening. Under those circumstances, or perhaps straight out of school, suddenly you are in the job market, and the particular job for which you have the most skills is not one that other companies are seeking to fill. This is when an objective understanding of your mental preferences, competencies, and mental options becomes not only a key to self-awareness, but also a key to finding the next job. The self-understanding that can come from knowing your thinking preferences allows you to map your current qualifications and also to locate your areas of needed competencies. When these needed competencies are in mental alignment with your existing competencies and preferences, you have a clear path to achievable self-development. When the opportunities you are trying to pursue are not in alignment with your existing preferences and <a id="page_381"></a>competencies, great motivation is required to acquire them, and the likelihood of expert-level success is substantially reduced.</p>
<p class="indent">I recall the story of a woman who had been laid off from her job as an HR partner. The role had changed—it had become strategic, and thus out of alignment with her preferences and skills, which were much more tactical—to such an extent that her performance was marginal and her job fulfillment unacceptable. We all know people who’ve experienced this. But the trauma of being laid off can turn out to be an opportunity—to find work that is a much better fit and can ultimately lead a person to greater success and substantially more job fulfillment and personal satisfaction.</p>
<p class="indent">Our experience demonstrates that the likelihood of this happening is greatly improved if the person knows his or her preferences and the associated strengths and weaknesses as they translate into job capabilities—the person can then pursue the strengths with renewed confidence. A process developed by our partners in France called Snapshot (Photo-Competences) was originally developed for a large corporate assessment center that sought to provide better guidance for employee development. It builds off the individual’s HBDI preference data, comparing it to the HBDI job profile and the HBDI proforma profile of the person’s desired growth path. This is particularly useful when you’re at a point in your life where the door is open to becoming more aligned with the work that stimulates you most, and you are seeking development opportunities that are in alignment with those preferences. This strategy breaks the nonaligned cycle of the past, in which you may have ended up in work you didn’t really like to do and from which you derived little satisfaction. Life is too short to perpetuate this mismatch.</p>
<h4 class="h4">When New Learning Takes Place</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another key basis for change is experiencing a significant new learning. Take the all-too-common case of a person who has never managed before and has been promoted into a management position because of his or her technical competence rather than his or her management qualifications. This happens all the time in sales and other functions. In the case of TJ, a combination of excellent management education and mentoring enabled him to become a knowledgeable, skilled management practitioner. He knew that a significant change was taking place, and his most important feedback came from his direct reports, his peers, and the leader to whom he reported. The combined learning from academic courses, mentoring, and coaching transformed him from someone who managed by instinct to someone who now understood the work of managing and had developed the skills to perform the role effectively. In addition to a measurable shift in TJ’s thinking, there was also an <a id="page_382"></a>essential new capability, that of being situationally responsive to daily managerial requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">I am describing two different kinds of change. One is a relatively permanent shift in preference toward the quadrant direction of the learning enlightenment. This is possible, but it requires a shift in values, so it’s less frequent. The second aspect of change is the increased flexibility of responding for brief periods of time via mental domains that are not primary preferences but are now more available situationally as the work requires (see <a class="nounder" href="ch26.html#ch26fig1">Figure 26-1</a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch26fig1"></a><img src="f0382-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="676" height="377"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 26-1</small></strong> HBDI Profiles: Two types of change. Permanent and situational shifts in profiles.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">When Values Shift</h4>
<p class="noindent">Next, consider an individual who has undergone a significant shift in values. The cause might have been recovering from a major illness, escaping a serious accident, having a child, or losing a dear friend or a spouse. Whatever the reason, the person has been affected so significantly that his or her values are now different. A specific example is when my daughter Ann had her children. Having these young and fragile new family members suddenly shifted her focus to a caring, stable, and more traditional approach to life. Her worldview had changed significantly, and because of that, so did her HBDI Profile and behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">Value shifts at this level can change the way people think and therefore change what they want to do and how they want to do it. Most of us can cite personal examples of people we know or have read about. My point is that these changes do happen—sometimes unplanned—and they usually show <a id="page_383"></a>up as a dramatic change in the person’s profile. How to put these shifts in values, interests, and priorities to work is a question that is worth considering. (For more on the relationship between values and thinking preferences, download the bonus chapter, “Your Hidden ‘Owner’s Manual’: A Whole Brain Approach to Personal Values,” at <a class="nounder" href="http://www.wholebrainbusinessbook.com">www.wholebrainbusinessbook.com</a>.)</p>
<p class="indentb">When a values shift causes a job mismatch, corrective action is called for. It is up to the individual to take that action. I am convinced that most of us know more about our jobs than anybody else, including our managers, and most of us have a great deal more freedom of action than we have thus far claimed. Therefore:</p>
<p class="numberlist2">1. Where we have freedom of action, we should make changes in our job to bring it into better alignment with our current mental preferences and those activities that both stimulate us and fulfill the job requirements.</p>
<p class="numberlist2">2. Where we don’t have freedom of action, we should bring the proposed changes to the attention of our manager and persuade him or her that it’s in the best interests of all concerned to make them.</p>
<p class="numberlist2">3. If we are the manager, we should make use of our own freedom of action to foster those changes by encouraging our employees to better align themselves with their work and by granting them the freedom to act more independently in making those adjustments.</p>

<p class="att"><strong>—Deng Ming-Dao</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">I see this as a win-win-win scenario: it’s a win for the person, it’s a win for the manager, and it’s a win for the company because a better-aligned employee is going to be more productive and more fulfilled on the job. This is what managers are supposed to do anyway. But by taking advantage of change, we are finding ways for the employees to help managers achieve their bottom-line goals.</p>

<p class="sidebartitle"><a id="page_384"></a><strong>Put It to Work</strong></p>
<p class="noindentb1">As we discussed in <a class="nounder" href="ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>, our mindsets will get in the way of growth and any needed change; unless they are addressed correctly, they will stop any change from taking place. Applying Whole Brain Thinking is a good way to start breaking down the walls around your mindset, to better enable you to change. Start by thinking about some of the walls you’ve built over the years, walls that need to come down in order for you to grow.</p>
<p class="noindentlba"><strong>Define and analyze it.</strong> What are these walls, and what mindset(s) do they come from? (A quadrant.)</p>
<p class="sidebull">• What is the current mindset that is shaping your thinking and creating these walls?</p>
<p class="sidebull">• What are some of the recent decisions you’ve made that might have been influenced by this mindset, and that would have been better served by another approach?</p>
<p class="sidebullb">• In what specific ways do these walls represent a barrier to change for you?</p>
<p class="noindentlba"><strong>Challenge it.</strong> Why are you holding on to this mindset, and why haven’t you let go of it? (D quadrant.)</p>
<p class="sidebull">• What are the potential blind spots that this mindset and these walls create?</p>
<p class="sidebull">• Have these walls become self-fulfilling prophecies? How can you change your mindset around them to see things differently?</p>
<p class="sidebull">• What will be your biggest fears and challenges in breaking down the walls?</p>
<p class="sidebullb">• What will be your greatest opportunities and wins if you explore a new mindset?</p>
<p class="noindentlba"><strong>Sense it.</strong> How do I and others feel about it? (C quadrant.)</p>
<p class="sidebull">• How do your feelings and emotions support and fuel this mindset?</p>
<p class="sidebull">• How is your current mindset different from those of other people who do not seem to have these walls?</p>
<p class="sidebull">• Who can you talk with to gain greater confidence and clarity concerning the situation at hand?</p>
<p class="sidebullb">• Who can help you look at things differently from the way you normally do, mentor you, and provide needed affirmation and support in this situation?</p>
<p class="noindentlba"><a id="page_385"></a><strong>Develop a plan.</strong> Am I ready to change, and, if so, how? (B quadrant.)</p>
<p class="sidebull">• What would it take for you to change this mindset and break down these walls?</p>
<p class="sidebull">• What are some low-cost, low-risk ways of getting started to test what this change will be like?</p>
<p class="sidebull">• How will your preferences affect the process and make this easier or harder? How can you leverage or mitigate those effects?</p>
<p class="sidebull">• What are some of the other mindsets and approaches that you have seen work for others that you might adopt and use in the process?</p>
<p class="sidebull">• What will success look like? When and how will you get started?</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">As the Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, “Nothing endures but change.” It is the one thing that we can absolutely predict will happen. This cannot be more true than in the world of business. The good news is that through an understanding of how you and others think, and with the application of Whole Brain Thinking, you can ride the wave of change to greater levels of success: for you, for your team, and for your organization. It’s up to you.</p>
<p class="title"><strong>SO WHAT?</strong></p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Resources for facilitating change are available around the world. These include schools, developmental institutes, courses, books, online resources, MOOCs and webinars, and mentors and coaches.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Changes that bring individuals into better alignment with their work are often win-win-win: a win for the individuals, a win for the manager, and a win for the company.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  When motivated, individuals can and should develop skills in areas of lesser preference in order to be more effective and deal with their blind spots.</p>
