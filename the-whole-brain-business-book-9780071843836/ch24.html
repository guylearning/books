<p class="para"><strong><span class="dropcap">T</span></strong>he leadership at Cornerstone Schools of Alabama has a complex job. As a nonprofit that serves low-income children, the school is funded entirely by donations, meaning that the leaders start each year with no money guaranteed—not even tuition. To earn the budget to run and manage the school, the development department depends heavily on the support of corporations, foundations, and local business leaders. Theirs is data-intensive, time-sensitive work that requires a relentless focus on the numbers and details to keep up with a fast-growing and traditionally underserved student population along with the stringent academic standards involved with maintaining the school’s accreditations and its status as an International Baccalaureate World School.</p>
<p class="indent">Considering all this, it’s not surprising that the PR volunteer coordinator was in a challenging position and was driving everyone else on the team crazy. As talented as she was in relating to others, always being ready to pitch in and be flexible about helping out, when she was asked for the data, charts, and detailed information that the other team members needed, she <em>never delivered</em>. In fact, she didn’t seem to be interested in the numbers at all. She was outgoing, friendly, and well spoken, but her operating style was best described as “all over the place.” It had become a continual source of frustration for the rest of the team.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the executive director, Dr. Nita Carr,<sup><a id="ch24end1a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch24end1">1</a></sup> saw the value that this person provided, and she wanted the others to see it, too. She brought in HBDI <a id="page_348"></a>practitioner Bill Hart to conduct HBDI Profiles and facilitate a Whole Brain Thinking workshop to help all the team members understand how the team’s diversity contributed to its mission.</p>
<p class="indent">There were plenty of “aha! moments” during the discussions. Although no one was shocked to discover this person’s extremely strong preference for interpersonally oriented C-quadrant thinking, a lot of lightbulbs went off—the other members realized that they needed her unique strengths and perspectives to keep the community engaged and maintain the partnerships that were so essential to the school’s ongoing viability. Dr. Carr was thrilled with the results.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">The best part of one’s life is the working part, the creative part. Believe me, I love to succeed; but the real spiritual and emotional excitement is in the doing.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Garson Kanin, writer and director</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">So she was surprised when the PR coordinator showed up at her office the next day, visibly upset. She told Dr. Carr that she didn’t want to be viewed as someone who had no interest in the numbers or in following processes. She felt that she had more to offer than what they were seeing of her, and she made a personal commitment: she would stretch herself and get more comfortable with her analytical A- and structured B-quadrant thinking modes. She put together her own development plan focused on building these skills.</p>
<p class="indent">“At one point, I had worried that she might be stuck, that I wouldn’t be able promote her,” Dr. Carr said. “But she totally turned it around. People’s perceptions of her changed, too. And it was all her. She took the initiative.”</p>
<p class="indent">As I’ve said throughout this book, your thinking preferences are just that—preferences. You’re not limited to them. But how do you stretch outside your “mental defaults” and grow in new directions? This chapter will give you some practical ways to take the initiative and take charge of your own learning and development.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Claiming Your Mental Space</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the best ways for people to help themselves move in any desired developmental direction is for them to “claim their own mental space.” By this, I mean finding the energy to develop the required skills in those portions of the Whole Brain spectrum that need to be accessed if you are to fulfill your long-term goals successfully. A current example for me was the writing of this book—an important long-term goal. My least-preferred quadrant is the <a id="page_349"></a>lower-left B, and even though I have developed a wide range of skills in that mode over the course of my career, to get this book finished, I had to “claim” even more of the mental B-quadrant discipline and attention to detail to meet my goal.</p>
<p class="indent">A colleague with strong preferences in the A and D quadrants recently did a similar exercise in claiming mental space in the C quadrant. Embarking on what he called an “empathy skill development track,” he wanted to know what resources I could recommend in that regard. When I asked why this was a focus for him, he shared that both at work and at home, his lack of attention to and low level of sensitivity for emotional issues continued to be a problem for him. At home, it was affecting his relationship with his daughter and his wife. Although his values are strongly anchored in “family,” he knew that his preferences and behaviors were getting in the way. In addition, a recent feedback session with his boss had highlighted a similar gap in his ability to manage and coach his direct reports with greater interpersonal sensitivity and skills. He embarked on the development journey with great motivation, using the Whole Brain model as a reminder that he <em>could</em> do it.</p>
<p class="indent">Another great example is an independent consultant I have known for years who decided that her low preference for the A quadrant was the primary reason that she was not getting her dissertation work completed. She had reached the phase of the work that required taking a deep dive into the collected data and performing statistical analysis; it was the final barrier to getting this life project completed. Once she understood that her low preference was part of the issue, she concocted a fun way to “mind hack” herself into developing energy and enjoyment for this critical work. She thought of it like a game and reached out to a mentor for moral support. Her dissertation was completed in two months.</p>
<p class="indent">And here’s one more example: an associate told the story of how her lack of attention to detail was impeding her small business. Billing was delayed, important information was getting misplaced, and she found herself spending more time looking for things and catching up. This was her livelihood! She decided that this had to change. She found and hired an organizational consultant who helped her set up a visual, color-coded system with reminders and tracking that leveraged the technology she had available. They simplified the number of systems she had, and voilà! Everything began to work more smoothly, and her business grew as a result. Most of all, she felt enormous satisfaction from having conquered this “dragon” that was preventing her from accomplishing her goal.</p>
<p class="indent">Where do you want to put your mental energies and effort at this point in your life? How can you better use your mental potential to get where you want to go? Think first about a long-term goal that you want to achieve, either <a id="page_350"></a>personal or professional (for example, become an artist, start your own company, invent a new product, get a handle on your financial future, or get that next big promotion). Tap into your own instincts to identify the thinking modes that you are currently not using, and perhaps actively resisting, but that you need to access in order to achieve your developmental priorities. This is about charting your mental path. A tool to aid in this process is the Claiming My Mental Space exercise (see <a class="nounder" href="ch24.html#ch24fig1">Figure 24-1</a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch24fig1"></a><img src="f0350-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="676" height="526"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 24-1</small></strong> The claiming my mental space exercise.</p>
<p class="indent">In completing the exercise, you have used your increased understanding of your thinking self, developed by reading this book, along with the possible missing critical thinking elements that you need to access in order to be fully productive in the situation you have in mind. These elements most frequently occur in an area of lesser preference. This means that there is a gap between how we prefer to think and the portions of the thinking spectrum that have to be added in order to accomplish a goal or a task, but that are not now an active preference for you personally. What can you do about that?</p>
<p class="indent"><a class="nounder" href="ch24.html#ch24fig2">Figure 24-2</a> shows my personal profile, along with a profile of the shift in mental space that I needed in order to write this book. As I mentioned earlier, the writing of a book required more mental space than is typically available <a id="page_351"></a>to me under ordinary day-to-day circumstances. The implications were clear. In order to write this book in accordance with the book proposal that the publisher had accepted, and to deliver a manuscript complete with illustrations and graphics and do so within the allowable budget and on time, I would have to substantially supplement my normal profile of A- and D-quadrant preferred thinking with a substantial amount of additional B-quadrant mental activity. Furthermore, to accomplish my goals, I would have to consciously and deliberately claim not only my everyday mental space, but this new, enlarged mental space required by the task at hand.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch24fig2"></a><img src="f0351-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="676" height="364"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 24-2</small></strong> The mental space the author claimed when writing this book.</p>
<p class="indent">You will notice that I not only increased the stretch from my normal profile in the D quadrant, but also added a significant amount of mental space in the B quadrant. This is where the procedural and production aspects of book development are located. It’s where the signed contract takes precedence and where due dates need to be met as committed. This is where writing discipline is located and where much of the editorial work needs to take place.</p>

<p class="indent">A good personal example of how I applied this exercise to the writing of this book is that I committed myself to the discipline of writing each morning, seven days a week, until the initial writing phase was completed. The habit that I formed over the months of applying this discipline now allows the editing, rewriting, illustrating, and quote selection processes to take place <a id="page_352"></a>each morning, seven days a week. This illustrates the point that once I had fully claimed the mental space, it provided the basis for a significant increase in my overall capability. As a result of claiming this space, I have acquired a habit that greatly increases my productivity, not only on this book project, but in the everyday accomplishment of my business tasks.</p>

<p class="att"><strong>—Arthur Koestler</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">As I think is already clear, the kind of mental space I am talking about is not something that your boss or your spouse or your parents can give to you. For this new space to work for you, it must be <em>owned</em> by you, and there is only one good way that I know of to own it, and that is to personally claim it.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Jump-Starting Your Own Personal Development</h4>
<p class="noindent">When it comes to initiating your own development, I have pondered the question of how to begin for many years. It doesn’t need to be so difficult that you waste half your life wondering whether you are good enough to even start. For many people, that, in itself, is a huge barrier. Since getting started on mental development is such a personal issue with many variables involved, a rank-ordering of my considered answers on the best place to start is difficult, but high on the list has got to be <em>affirmation</em>, which we touched on in <a class="nounder" href="ch23.html#ch23">Chapter 23</a>. Attempting something that you have always wanted to do and then <em>doing it successfully</em> is an affirmation that can convince even the most practiced skeptic that he has what it takes to succeed. In my case, learning how to draw, sculpt, visualize, and use creative materials were techniques that allowed me to achieve in areas that I had never thought possible. I’ve seen this work time and again with other people, too. They were convinced that they could not do certain things, and so they avoided even trying. When they were guided into attempting these things and discovered that they could succeed, they were confronted with their own accomplishment. Whether it is taking up a new hobby, learning a new skill, or embarking on any new learning endeavor, find ways to engage in activities that provide affirmation along the way. Often it helps to break things down into small milestones so that you can achieve “small wins” on the path to affirmation.</p>
<p class="indent">A key to affirmation is finding <em>facilitation</em> of the activity that leads to affirmation. For example, for a person whose mental space is blocked as if by an insurmountable brick wall, facilitation is a ramp up to <em>a door in that</em> <a id="page_353"></a><em>wall</em>. It is helpful to think of being “blocked” as only a temporary kind of disability that can be overcome through understanding. Through skilled facilitation, a person can uncover natural capability and have that ability developed and released in very effective ways. Think for a minute about a coach who can facilitate ability in a youngster who is batting a ball or ice skating or drawing a likeness. Amateur athletes use coaches throughout their careers; professional teams use coaches on a full-time basis; professional golfers and opera singers rely on coaches. The same approach works with a businessperson or any other individual who needs coaching or mentorship to facilitate his or her movement toward a new skill or ability. Such coaching, mentoring, or facilitation is available from many sources. However, the motivation must come from the individual who is seeking to grow.</p>

<p class="centers">I want to grow. I want to be better. You grow. We all grow. We’re made to grow. You either evolve or you disappear.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Tupac Shakur</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Along with affirmation and facilitation comes <em>permission</em>, which we just touched on in the exercise of claiming your mental space. Many of us hang back until we think we have permission. By that I mean permission to try, permission to take a risk, permission to experiment, and, most especially, permission to fail. I have discovered that this permission is very hard to come by. We are reluctant to give ourselves permission, and what’s surprising is that we are often prone to decline the permission that has been granted to us by others. For me, there was a certain inherent shyness that came to the surface when a chance to be creative was offered. It is all too easy to turn down the invitation and not seize the opportunity. For this reason, permission must be overt. It must be obvious. It must be without strings or consequences, and in this regard, the hardest permission to come by is the permission that we give ourselves. In fact, to help learners get past self-denial and the fear of failure, I would encourage them to hang a formal certificate on their wall giving them permission to claim their own mental space (see <a class="nounder" href="ch24.html#ch24fig3">Figure 24-3</a>). This applies to anything where the fear of failure prevents us from moving forward.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch24fig3"></a><img src="f0354-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="676" height="522"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 24-3</small></strong> A sample “Claim Your Mental Space Certificate” for claiming your own mental space.</p>
<p class="indent">By <em>mental space</em> I mean the both the physical and the psychological space that allows, gives permission for, and encourages personal development to take place. For example, some forms of development demand a certain amount of private <em>physical space</em> to allow people to engage in the activity and still feel “safe.” Taking learning risks might be too messy and too long-lasting to be done on the kitchen table, in front of the TV, or on your desk at work. So you need your own dedicated area where you can do what you need to do without possibly interfering with other people’s workspace, without getting in the way <a id="page_354"></a>of your everyday tasks, and where you have the freedom to do what might feel like “weird stuff” to you, especially in the beginning.</p>
<p class="indent">After physical space, the next space to consider is the <em>psychological space</em> we all need when privacy is essential to our feeling safe during the process, and where personal risks can be explored before they are committed to publicly. <em>And</em> where we are simply comfortable enough to eliminate the self-generated ogres that tend to get in the way of the learning process.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, there is the stretch to the new <em>mental space</em> that needs to be claimed, as we discussed earlier.</p>
<p class="indent">I encourage you to create your own declaration of granting yourself permission to claim your mental space. (Visit <a class="nounder" href="http://www.wholebrainbusinessbook.com">www.wholebrainbusinessbook.com</a> to download a certificate.) Keep it in your workspace, within your line of sight. That way, whenever you become unsure that you have your own permission or the organization’s permission, you can refer to your “official certification of permission” as documentation that you have what it takes to behave in new ways. Claiming your mental space implies that it is a priority. It is more than just a personal urge; it is actually legitimate work.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_355"></a>Unfortunately, there are many business cultures that consider learning activities to be something other than work. Instead of being on task, these activities are thought of as a loss of focus and a deviation from assigned work. For these reasons, the priority that I am alluding to needs to be held not only by the person who is attempting to learn, but also by those people who manage that individual. In a workplace environment, to be most effective, this sense of priority has to be established simultaneously by the individual and his or her manager.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">I need problems. A good problem makes me come alive.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Roland “Tiny” Rowland</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Along with affirmation, facilitation, priority, and permission, I recommend creating a <em>portfolio of personal accomplishments</em>. Successful artists have a portfolio of their prize-winning work. Authors have a shelf of books. Photographers have a portfolio of pictures. Businesspeople have a résumé or curriculum vitae that lists their accomplishments. Businesspeople can also assemble a portfolio of their new learning accomplishments. This can include such things as certifications, ideas submitted to the suggestion system, accomplishments as a member of a task force, or documented new solutions submitted to management. It won’t take long to accumulate an impressive body of work that represents your learning journey. In surveys I have conducted, I have discovered that more than a third of the thousands of people responding have a “body of work” suitable for documentation, <em>much of which may have been developed outside of the workplace.</em> I think it is revealing to note that most of these people never thought in terms of a body of work until I asked the question. Recognizing that a personal body of work exists is a major affirmation of one’s ability. I could tell from the brightness of the respondents’ eyes and the broad smiles on their faces that these individuals felt very good about their accomplishments over the years. I have kept a portfolio of my accomplishments, and I find it personally inspiring to review this growing body of work. It is, in fact, a very real affirmation that reminds me to give myself permission to “go for it” again.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Acquiring Personal Learning Habits</h4>
<p class="noindent">Developing stretch or learning habits is another helpful way to unleash your personal potential. During the 15 years that art was my second professional occupation, I developed a habit that contributed in a major way to my artistic success and productivity. I typically painted a picture a week and completed a sculpture every two months. I discovered that at any given time, I had <a id="page_356"></a>in my mind four or five compelling scenes or subjects for my next painting or sculpture. The problem was making a choice among a number of very desirable subjects. I would usually start a painting on Saturday morning and finish it for framing a week later, typically on Sunday afternoon. On one occasion, at the beginning of this highly productive period, I decided to make the decision about the subject of the next painting <em>before I left the studio</em> after finishing the current painting. After signing the painting that I was working on and removing the watercolor paper from the art table, I would think for a few minutes about the subjects that intrigued me at that moment. In a few minutes of contemplation, I was able to sort out the one that was of primary interest, and then, working rapidly with my pencil, I would commit myself to that as the subject of my next painting. I would often commit myself more completely to that chosen subject by brushing in a color wash in the places appropriate to the final scene. I would then set that new watercolor paper aside and complete the matting and framing of the work I had just finished.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Man’s mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">What happened next strongly confirms the stage of the creative process that is called <em>incubation</em>. We know that our brains are working all the time, and this is proof: between the time I committed myself on paper and the next time I could work in my studio, I found myself painting that picture in my mind. By the time I returned to the painting, several days might have passed, or even most of the week, but I was able to quickly complete the preliminary sketch that was the initial phase of the painting and then block in the main elements of the scene, with almost complete confidence that what I was doing would be part of the finished painting. This technique worked so well for me that it became an absolute unwritten rule that I would always start the next painting before I left the studio. Tangible evidence of the success of this strategy was that I won prizes (60) and sold paintings (400) at an increasing rate.</p>
<p class="indent">I applied the same discipline to my sculpture, but since the processes are so different, I couldn’t commit myself with a few lines on paper; instead, I had to make a miniature in clay of what I intended to sculpt on a larger scale. Again, the same thing happened. I was able to make progress subconsciously by working through the design of the finished piece in my mind as I went about my other business. This is a key characteristic of the brain. If you present your mental self with a situation, your mind can work on that situation unconsciously and effortlessly during other activity or sleep, so that <a id="page_357"></a>as you reengage with the task in question, you have made progress toward its solution. I have used this habit now for about 30 years with great success. You can, too!</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Many people know how to work hard; many others know how to play well; but the rarest talent in the world is the ability to introduce elements of playfulness into work, and to put some constructive labor into our leisure.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Sydney J. Harris</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">A new habit that I acquired while writing this book is writing or recording my ideas every morning, seven days a week, on topics of interest that come to mind. Before I go to sleep, as I contemplate the next morning’s writing, I present myself with subject alternatives. When I wake up, I spend 15 minutes in a theta state that is conducive to my creative process, which positions me to engage the subject that I’m interested in. When I go to my private place, the subject presents itself to me in a manner that I can respond to with great ease and comfort.</p>
<p class="indent">Another measure of the success of these strategies is that I never “lost” a painting or a sculpture, and I never “lost” a topic. In other words, in each case, I completed what I started out with in a form that I could frame, display, or publish. You can easily apply this process to anything you want to work on or learn. Just get started!</p>

<div class="sidebar1b">
<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>Unleash Your Full Brainpower</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Unleashing your full thinking potential can be uncomfortable, whether you are a highly structured thinker who needs to experiment and take more risks, or a highly imaginative person who needs the discipline and organization to be more productive with your time.</p>
<p class="indentb1">Fortunately, brain research supports the fact that you <em>can</em> stretch and overcome your mental blind spots. It starts with making your thinking work for you rather than being trapped by it. Here are some tips for putting your Whole Brain to work:</p>
<p class="number">1. <strong>Get used to being uncomfortable.</strong> Discomfort is a sign that your brain is engaged and learning. As the business environment becomes more challenging and diverse, with new generations and increased globalization being added to the mix, your initial reaction may be to see the negative in all this complexity. Instead of wanting to avoid those who make you uncomfortable, recognize the opportunity they offer to help you stretch your perspectives. Hire and enlist them. They can become your biggest assets. Instead of avoiding domains that make your head spin, embrace them. Make it a personal challenge to work through the discomfort to new understanding.</p>
<p class="number">2. <strong>Challenge your assumptions.</strong> The brain is very efficient, and it will “fill in the blanks” for you when you’re looking for a solution. But when you’re trying to see something in a different way or find a new way of doing things, the quick leap to conclusions can ultimately be a trap. When you begin to make an assumption, flip it around. Ask yourself, “What if this were <em>not</em> true?”</p>
<p class="number">3. <strong>Embrace the unknown.</strong> It is your ally, not your enemy. The known may be your worst enemy. Change presents a great opportunity for new thinking, but only if we deliberately and consciously take advantage of it.</p>
<p class="number">4. <strong>Optimize your toolkit.</strong> Use your own thinking preferences to determine the tools that work for you. If you’re a highly visual thinker, a linear, spreadsheet-style planning tool may make the task of getting organized even more difficult for you. If the techniques and processes aren’t helping, look to your thinking preferences for clues and help on how you can find or create a more workable solution for you.</p>
<p class="number">5. <strong>Lighten up.</strong> Unconventional approaches free the brain and stimulate new ideas and perspectives. Find ways to jolt your thinking and have fun with it.</p>
<p class="number">6. <strong>Make it a mental habit.</strong> Decide what you want and go for it, working at it daily if possible, making your desired future outcomes a reality.</p>

<p class="title"><a id="page_359"></a><strong>SO WHAT?</strong></p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Claiming your mental space allows you to chart your mental path and use your thinking potential to take you where you want to go.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  A good way to start the release of hidden potential is to experience the <em>affirmation</em> of success, and this can be greatly <em>facilitated</em> through <em>coaching</em> or <em>mentoring</em>.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  For many people, the key to accessing locked-up potential is the granting of <em>permission</em>, not only by others such as the boss, but also, hardest of all to achieve, by themselves.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  The difference between success and failure, particularly in work that requires new learning, is often the personal discipline and commitment that we provide. By identifying a needed discipline(s) and making a habit of it, we help guarantee a successful professional outcome.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Stretching your thinking and seeing beyond your mental blind spots can be an uncomfortable process, but it will make you more engaged, informed, and able to succeed in an ever more complex world.<a id="page_360"></a></p>
