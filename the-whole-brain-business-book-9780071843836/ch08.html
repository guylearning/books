<p class="para"><strong><span class="dropcap">A</span></strong>fter a five-year search for a building site, my wife, Margy, and I finally found what we considered to be the ideal place to build a home that would serve as our residence and our headquarters: Lake Lure, North Carolina, at a resort complex now called Rumbling Bald Resort. After settling on the Oregon architect Lou Bruinier to help us design the house, we scheduled a date for him to fly out and view the site.</p>
<p class="indent">The morning of the site visit was a perfect September day in the mountains. I led Lou along the pathway skirting the ridge to a clearing on the mountain-side that provided a breathtaking view of the lake, the valley below, and the surrounding mountains. The architect was visibly moved by what he saw. He just stood there, drinking it in.</p>
<p class="indent">“Well, Lou, what do you think?” I asked. Without turning to me, he answered, “What a place to build a home. What a place to live forever. I feel like I’m doing God’s work. Thank you for the privilege!” He then took out his sketchbook and entered the first lines of his design.</p>
<p class="indent">About a year later, with Lou’s plans ready, we began the search for a builder, and eventually landed on Grover Wilson, the local “Sultan of Homes.” I took him up to the building site, and just as it had been at the time of Lou’s visit, it <a id="page_124"></a>was a perfect September day. After Grover looked out at the view and around the site, I asked him, “Well, Grover, what do you think?”</p>
<p class="indent">After a minute, he turned, peered at me, and said, “Oh, I’ve seen a lot worse than this.”</p>
<p class="indent">Another year went by, and while we were in the process of arranging for a construction loan and mortgage, I invited the banker up to the mountain-side to inspect the building site. Once again it was a beautiful September day. He made his way along the same path that Lou and Grover had walked along, taking care not to snag his three-piece suit or scratch his briefcase on the brambles. Once we arrived at the spot, I posed the same question I had asked the others: “Well, Jack, what do you think?”</p>
<p class="indent">Jack looked me straight in the eye and said, “Ned, you’ll never grow corn on this land.”</p>

<p class="centers">After all, when you come right down to it, how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language?</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Russell Hoban</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">I had tried to anticipate his response, but this was beyond my imagining.</p>
<p class="indent">How different is the view from each of our different thinking preference perspectives, and how different are the meanings we attribute to the words we use to describe those perspectives. The old saw that the Americans and the British are two peoples divided by a common language applies to those of us with dissimilar thinking styles as well. We assume we get what the other person means because we use the same words, but that’s not necessarily the case.</p>
<h4 class="h4">The Dialects of the Brain</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is hardly a single topic that is more fundamental to the business process than communication. And there is probably hardly any process that is more susceptible to failure than the everyday activity of businesspeople talking, writing, and somehow signaling to each other. People have vastly different perspectives and attach different meanings to the words they use to describe those perspectives. In fact, differences in thinking preferences can be so great that they create separate and distinct “languages” or dialects. We may be using the same vocabulary, but the dialects assign different meanings to the words and use them to describe worlds seen from vastly different perspectives.</p>
<p class="indent">In essence, we are experiencing the world around us as filtered through our profile of mental preferences. Where we have strong preferences, it’s as if we’re seeing and hearing things close to the way they actually are. In our <a id="page_125"></a>areas of lesser preference, on the other hand, we’re likely to be partially blind and deaf. And in our areas of avoidance, most of us don’t see or hear accurately at all.</p>
<p class="indent">If we built a continuum of communication success, the high point would occur between two individuals with nearly identical profiles and equal experience in the same profession. At the opposite end would be a pair with opposing profiles, where each person’s preference is the other’s avoidance and where they hold entirely different levels of experience, such as an A-quadrant insurance company actuary and a C-quadrant kindergarten teacher.</p>
<p class="indent"><a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08fig1">Figure 8-1</a> shows that the most effective and least difficult communication takes place between people who have the <em>same quadrant</em> preference and are in the same occupation. These two people are on the same wavelength, so to speak, and words are likely to mean the same thing to each of them because of their similar preferences and occupations.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 8-1</small></strong> Communication continuum: communication between those with different thinking styles. The impact of preference on how easy or difficult it is to communicate.</p>
<p class="indent">Somewhat more difficult and less effective communication takes place between two people whose profiles are in <em>compatible quadrants</em>, such as the <a id="page_126"></a>left-mode A and B and the right-mode D and C. The next lower level of communication success occurs between individuals representing <em>complementary quadrants</em>, such as A and D or B and C. These complementary quadrants represent interconnected specialized modes in the brain that are able to relate to each other in ways that often lead to creative thinking outcomes.</p>

<p class="att"><strong>—Chuang Tzu, “Autumn Floods” (4th–3rd c. BC), tr. Herbert A. Giles</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The most difficult end of the communication continuum is where opposing quadrants are involved in the transaction, such as the B and D quadrants or the A and C quadrants. To see what I mean, read the following dialogue between Walter, the vice president of advertising at a large corporation, and John, the creative director.</p>
<p class="indentb">The conversation begins when John walks into Walter’s office with a portfolio under his arm and a smile on his face. Behind his large desk, surrounded by imposing office furniture and traditional décor, Walter looks up as John enters and then stops, about eight feet into the office. Without changing his expression, Walter remarks, “I wasn’t aware that we had an appointment, John, but you look as if you have something you want to say.”</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Yes, I do. I need to tell you about some new developments on our campaign for this year’s new product line. As you know, we’ve made such a departure in the new designs that we’ve been struggling with how to present these ideas in the fall campaign.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>WALTER:</strong> OK, John, but keep it short. I’ve got to prepare for an important meeting upstairs.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Great. So, Walter, I think I had a breakthrough this morning just after waking up. As I was lying there slowly coming awake, it suddenly dawned on me that our previous approaches to this campaign missed the main concept of the new line. As I lay there mulling that over, I began to see …</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>WALTER:</strong> What is the point, John? I’m on a schedule here. Don’t take me through your whole <em>Good Morning America</em> sequence.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Well, I felt it was important for you to know where the idea came from and how it evolved.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><a id="page_127"></a><strong>WALTER:</strong> You know me well enough to know that all I’m interested in is the end result—not all the hokey stuff that leads up to it.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Yes, I know that, and I don’t want to take time away from your important work, but this seems like it’s a crucial campaign, so it needs not only your approval but also your support in making it happen.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>WALTER:</strong> John, get on with it.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>JOHN:</strong> OK, so, the central concept is that instead of featuring individual elements of the product line, what I think we ought to do, and what came to me when I was visualizing this, is a large-format piece showing the whole product line, with visuals showing how each separate product is related to each of the products in the line. We could also create a great animated video that I think would attract some attention.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>WALTER:</strong> OK, that seems obvious. So what’s the big deal?</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Well, the vision I had for our marketing strategy is oriented toward the whole system rather than the product pieces, and that’s why the campaign needs to be expanded to a global approach rather than focused on the parts.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>WALTER:</strong> Well, we’ve done pretty darn well around here talking about the parts! Our customers are used to it. I don’t see why we should risk a new approach when you look at the successful track record we’ve had for the past few years. And it’s not like our competitors are talking about the whole system. Before we go sailing off into the blue, I’m going to need some hard facts that support such a costly shift.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Well, I haven’t really gotten to the issue of cost yet, but it seems to me that we have a good chance of bringing this thing in at the same cost and with greater impact.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>WALTER:</strong> John, I’ve told you time and again that there are certain ground rules for bringing things to my attention. The first is that you have a complete presentation, starting with the cost of the project and the breakdown of the critical elements, especially with anything new like an online video. Second, that you have a schedule showing the beginning, middle, and end of the project. Third, that you have sufficient copies of these support materials available so I can have other members of the staff check them out too, and fourth, that you make an appointment in advance.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>JOHN:</strong> Yes, yes, Walt, I know the ground rules, but since this is a hot idea, I thought we could make some quick sketches and preliminary layouts to show you while the idea was fresh. That way we can take advantage of the possible time saved by making a quick decision to go in this direction. Take a look at these layout sketches …</p>
<p class="noindentl"><a id="page_128"></a><strong>WALTER:</strong> John, you know I can’t do that without the rest being prepared. Aren’t you listening to me? When you’re ready to present your advertising campaign in a way that factors in the costs and the time to accomplish the task, I’ll gladly give you more time, but until then, I’m not available to discuss it. So get cracking!</p>
<p class="indentt">When the differences in thinking preferences and work requirements are both severely out of alignment, effective communication is least likely to occur. And when it does succeed, it is the result of intense focus and motivation on the part of the people involved. They really want to make it work.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle1"><strong>Put It to Work</strong></p>
<p class="noindentb">Read over the dialogue between Walter and John twice, and then answer the following questions:</p>
<p class="bullet">• Both Walter and John are making “valid” points from their quadrant perspectives. What quadrants are represented in their communication approaches?</p>
<p class="bulleti"><span class="gray">•</span> Walter</p>
<p class="bulleti"><span class="gray">•</span> John</p>
<p class="bullet">• What quadrant(s) does your own communication most reflect? Are you more technical, precise, and to the point (A)? Detailed, thorough, and step-by-step (B)? Expressive, informal, and personal (C)? Or big picture, conceptual, and imaginative (D)? (See <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08fig3">Figures 8-3</a>, <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08fig4">8-4</a>, and <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08fig5">8-5</a> for more clues.)</p>
<p class="bullet">• What quadrants do you overlook most in your communication? Do you overlook facts, data, technical aspects (A)? Details, structure, and consistency (B)? Expressiveness, eye contact, and interpersonal sharing (C)? Or metaphorical, imaginative, holistic language (D)? (See <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08fig3">Figures 8-3</a>, <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08fig4">8-4</a>, and <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08fig5">8-5</a> for more clues.)</p>
<p class="bullet">• Walter and John are not really communicating well. Think about a time in which you experienced a similar situation.</p>

<p class="bulleti"><span class="gray">•</span> What challenges did you encounter as a result?</p>
<p class="bulletib"><span class="gray">•</span> Did you ultimately get the results you needed?</p>
<p class="indent">Now identify some specific changes you can make in your communication approach to better meet the needs of your listeners so that you get what you want from the communication. <em>Refer to the models provided in this chapter, which describe the different communication styles and implications across the Whole Brain Model</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebar1ba">
<p class="sidebartitle"><a id="page_129"></a><strong>The Male-Female Communication Chasm</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">From our database, we can conclude that men and women are, on average, equally strong candidates for experiencing difficulties similar to the B/D communication situation between Walter and John, but typically involving an A/C disconnect. That’s because, statistically, more men prefer the A quadrant and least prefer the C, whereas more women prefer the exact opposite (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08fig2">Figure 8-2</a>). I believe this to be the root of what has been described as the “Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus”<sup><a id="ch08end1a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch08end1">1</a></sup> syndrome (among other books that have been written on this topic). The fact that these differences contribute to the attraction between men and women increases the likelihood that a lot of relationships will be stressed or actually ruptured because of the inherent communication difficulty brought about by the combining of opposing quadrants. Both at home and in the workplace, this provides the opportunity to first understand these differences, then to find value in the complementary nature of these differences, working to bridge the gap and leverage those differences by communicating more effectively.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch08fig2"></a><img src="f0129-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="676" height="526"/></p>
<p class="figcap1"><strong><small>FIGURE 8-2</small></strong> HBDI profiles averages of males and females in current database.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_130"></a>It is easy to see how specialized jargon can develop around occupational choices and mental preferences. I believe this tends to increase the likelihood of misunderstandings taking place between people with different preferences working in different occupations.</p>
<p class="indent"><a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08fig3">Figure 8-3</a> helps explain the differences in processing modes on the basis of the four-quadrant model. In this case, the four quadrants are shown as vertical columns, with the horizontal rows indicating key descriptors, occupational choices, and examples of typical phrases used. So where Walter, with his strong preference for B-quadrant thinking, responds best to well-structured and well-articulated approaches and talks about playing by the rules, John is frustrated by what he sees as Walter’s “one-track mind” and lack of imagination. On the other hand, while John, who prefers D-quadrant thinking, talks about the long-range big picture and the need to innovate on existing <a id="page_131"></a>approaches, bouncing ideas around to arrive at a solution, Walter says that John is undisciplined and unrealistic.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch08fig3"></a><img src="f0130-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="564" height="562"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 8-3</small></strong> Differences in typical processing modes for each quadrant.</p>
<p class="indent">It doesn’t have to be this way. Once we understand how different preferences are influencing our own and others’ communications, we can adapt to the different dialects of the brain. It takes awareness and conscious effort, but the payoff is worth it.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Communicating in a Whole Brain Way</h4>
<p class="noindent">The challenge for business managers is to find ways of communicating with diverse employee populations that ensure the <em>intended communication</em> actually takes place, regardless of differences in the way people perceive. When the intended communication is significant, it is necessary to design and deliver it in ways that allow understanding to take place in all four quadrants. My experience clearly demonstrates that the use of illustrations, videos, graphics, examples, stories, and metaphors, when added to the more traditional forms of communication, greatly enhances the likelihood that the intended meaning will be conveyed to a wide range of people.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Precision of communication is important, more important than ever in our era of hair-trigger balances, when a false or misunderstood word may create as much disaster as a sudden thoughtless act.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—James Thurber</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The fail-safe assumption is that the population you’ll be communicating with will be mentally diverse. Therefore, I recommend delivering each significant communication point in all quadrants and modes if you want to be sure that everyone “gets” what you mean. When information <em>must</em> be understood as intended, there is no option other than to employ all quadrants and modes of the Whole Brain Model in delivering that communication.</p>
<p class="indent">An easy way to do this is to apply the four-quadrant Whole Brain Communication Walk-Around Model (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08fig4">Figure 8-4</a>) to the significant points of the intended message. This is a problem-solving process that forces you to review the intended communication in each of the four quadrants, ultimately helping you avoid future problems that arise from miscommunication.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch08fig4"></a><img src="f0132-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="563" height="433"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 8-4</small></strong> Whole Brain Communication Walk-Around exercise. “Walk around” each quadrant to diagnose your communication style and/or prepare your next important communication.</p>
<p class="indentb">Suppose, for example, that a company president has just drafted a statement for the corporate newsletter. Her first key point is: “It is our strategic intent to double this business in the next five years.” She wants to be sure people understand her intended meaning, so she tests her draft statements by eliciting new <a id="page_132"></a>reactions from each of the four quadrants of the Whole Brain Communication Walk-Around Model:</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><em>Quadrant A possible reaction:</em> “Double the business in the next five years? Just what did she intend to convey: Double the sales? The profits? The number of employees? The total assets of the business?”</p>
<p class="bulletlistb"><span class="gray">•</span> By asking herself questions about the factual content of the proposed statement, the president realizes she has to be more precise in her language. What she really means is that the strategic intent is to double the <em>revenues</em> of the business—specifically, to grow from $2 billion to $4 billion in annual revenues.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><em>Quadrant B possible reaction:</em> “The draft statement does not address the organizational implications of doubling the revenue. Does she mean that this is to occur without any increase in infrastructure or staff on the basis of the same organizational arrangement?”</p>
<p class="bulletlistb"><a id="page_133"></a><span class="gray">•</span> The president discovers that she has failed to build into the statement her intention to create three new strategic business units to achieve this doubling of revenues.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><em>Quadrant C possible reaction:</em> If the president includes a reference to three new business units, the reaction could be: “What might that do to our culture, and does this mean that we will be doubling the number of employees as well? How will it affect the morale of the existing employees? Our customers?”</p>
<p class="bulletlistb"><span class="gray">•</span> The president’s statement must stipulate or strongly imply that the strategic intent is not to double employment to achieve a doubling of revenue, nor to double the work of each employee. The significant increase in market focus should allow the doubling of revenue to take place with minimum increases in numbers of employees and extra workload for current employees.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><em>Quadrant D possible reaction:</em> “The initial draft statement limits the strategic intent to five years. Does she mean that we don’t plan to grow after five years? Is there no longer-term vision or outlook?”</p>
<p class="bulletlist"><span class="gray">•</span> In reality, the strategic intent is to grow the business indefinitely, and doubling revenues in five years is just the first of a series of milestones stipulated in the long-range plan. The statement needs to add how this strategy is part of a 15-year vision.</p>
<p class="indentt">The benefit of the Whole Brain Walk-Around process is that it forces a quadrant-by-quadrant review of intended communication. After completing the walk-around, the president can now see that she will have to modify her draft statement if she is to convey what she intends. For example, she may want to revise it as follows:</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">“Out of sight, out of mind,” when translated into Russian (by computer), then back again into English, became “invisible maniac.”</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Arthur Calder-Marshall</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">“The strategic intent of the first five years of our long-range plan is to double the revenues of our business by reorganizing into three strategic business units, which will provide the level of market focus that will allow us to achieve this goal with minimum staff increases and infrastructure changes.”</p>
<p class="indent">To make sure that everyone understands her message, she should incorporate a visual presentation that graphically depicts the growth plan and provide a handout that documents her statement and stipulates when and what kinds <a id="page_134"></a>of organizational changes are needed. Addressing the C quadrant, she should offer to answer any questions or concerns or to meet on an individual basis if the changes directly affect an individual, and to help prepare key leaders to do so as well.</p>
<h4 class="h4">How Each Quadrant of the Whole Brain Model Communicates</h4>
<p class="noindent">An additional tool to help improve the communication process is the four-quadrant model of how communication takes place, shown in <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08fig5">Figure 8-5</a>. There are communication options for each quadrant that are characteristic of the type of thinking employed by individuals holding those preferences. Increased awareness of these differences aids the communication process by enabling people to listen more purposefully to what they hear and say what they mean more precisely. Improving communications does more than just relieve personal frustration; it means that things can move more quickly with fewer mistakes and missed opportunities.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch08fig5"></a><img src="f0134-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="564" height="300"/></p>
<p class="figcap1"><strong><small>FIGURE 8-5</small></strong> Each quadrant communicates differently.</p>

<p class="centers">No one would talk much in society if he knew how often he misunderstands others.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">I doubt that anyone would argue about the importance of effective communication. In all aspects of business and personal life, communication among members of a team is near or at the top of everybody’s list of contributors to success. We can also include the family here, since in many ways the most successful families function like a team.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_135"></a>Whole Brain teams, which are made up of individuals representing all four quadrants and all four modes, present a particularly difficult communication challenge. Taking into account the models in this chapter, think about the communication struggles of an eight-member team whose members are all unique in their preferences, and whose preferences, taken together, represent a balanced distribution of all the quadrant characteristics. There is a strong possibility that each team member is communicating more effectively in his or her area of preference, less effectively in his or her area of less preference, and perhaps not at all in his or her area of avoidance. This means that in the ideal Whole Brain team situation, there are communication patterns of highly variable effectiveness on any given discussion point. Team members who understand this reality will ask questions if they don’t understand or will offer paraphrasing or embellishment of their principal points as they are offered, using phrases such as, “By that I mean …,” “For instance …,” “This illustration will explain what I mean,” “This page of the handout explains what I mean,” or, “Here’s a metaphor that shows what I mean.”</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">When the eyes say one thing, and the tongue another, a practiced man relies on the language of the first.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Ralph Waldo Emerson</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">It takes a savvy team to engage in this kind of interaction, but it’s a requirement when you consider the reality of team communication needs given differences in perception. When Whole Brain team members learn how to express themselves in ways that are true to their thinking style but sensitive to other members’ styles, the chances are good that the team will be highly effective. See <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</a> for more on Whole Brain teams.</p>
