<p class="noindentt">“This stuff works.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s the comment that we hear almost daily from practitioners, business-people, learning professionals, and others. It works.</p>
<p class="indent">While advances in technology and new discoveries about the brain are continuing at an incredibly rapid pace, the point that matters most is this: How can you apply what we know about the brain and business to make a difference in the way you manage your attention, approach your work, communicate, solve problems, and lead? Because, without application, there’s not much business value.</p>
<p class="indent">So how <em>will</em> you apply what you’ve learned? After all, you’re the only one who can decide how to better leverage your own brain and the thinking that others provide. Each chapter in this book included a “Put It to Work” section. That’s a great place to start. You can also go online to <a class="nounder" href="http://www.wholebrainbusinessbook.com">www.wholebrainbusinessbook.com</a> to find additional activities and resources that expand on and supplement what you’ve learned here, Another way to tap into and build collective intelligence is to connect with other readers on the book’s LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest pages to find ways they are applying Whole Brain Thinking, and to share your own.</p>
