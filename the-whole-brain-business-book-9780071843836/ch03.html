<p class="para"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s head of management education at General Electric, I felt that my job was to put GE ahead of its competitors by improving manager development and by providing managers with a business-focused problem-solving approach they could apply and benefit from immediately. I believed we could move in that direction by revamping our management courses and learning programs based on new learning about brain function, but we soon realized we simply didn’t know enough about our learners’ thinking and learning styles— how they preferred to learn and process information. To do what we wanted, we needed an accurate mechanism for measuring preferences that was more workplace-friendly than wiring people up. That’s why I created the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_28"></a>While the HBDI doesn’t measure brainwave activity in the thinking structures, as my initial EEG research did, it does provide measurements of mental preferences, even more useful, which in turn can be easily interpreted and translated into quite predictable behavior outcomes in the workplace. When you combine that insight with tools to help you develop Whole Brain Thinking, your ability to better leverage your potential grows exponentially. The insights the data provide will help you better understand your preferences and their impact on your world.</p>

<p class="indent">Our degree of preference for each of the four thinking modes can be determined by our relative attraction to or aversion for the descriptors found in each mode, which are groups of mental processes that have some commonality (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch03fig1"></a><img src="f0028-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="401" height="402"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><small><strong>FIGURE 3-1</strong></small> Our four different selves. The Four Selves Model characterizes specialized modes of the Whole Brain Model in the form of selves that we act out in response to everyday situations.</p>
<p class="indent">One helpful way to see the business implications of thinking preferences is to think of them in the context of the organization itself. In every organization, there are different people playing different mental or thinking roles. <a id="page_29"></a>All are critical players in the overall success of the business, but their preferences shape both their perceptions and what they naturally gravitate to, the information that they “allow in” and what they filter out.</p>
<p class="indent">When you look at the Four Selves Model (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>), what functions in business do you think show up in the A quadrant, with its preference for logical, analytical, fact-based thinking? What functions probably fall into the B quadrant, focusing on organized, sequential, detail-oriented work? How about the feelings-based, intuitive C quadrant? And what jobs fall into the domain of the D quadrant, following a more imaginative, risk-taking approach?</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s look at four managers to see how this plays out in the workplace. Amanda is the finance manager at her company. She is courteous and polite, but she is always focused on business and tends toward the more directive side of management. The human resources staff often gets complaints that Amanda’s style is too hard, with an emphasis on the facts and too little attention to individuals’ feelings. When asked the question, “What can we do to increase our bottom line?” she says, “We need to upgrade our systems so we can increase our capacity, speed, and overall return on investment. Although we’ll have to make an initial up-front investment, we’ll be able to save time, reduce staff, and eliminate the overtime and additional employment expenses that are eating into our profits.” She has data sets, calculations, and spreadsheets to back up her statements.</p>
<p class="indent">Brent is the manager in charge of production. For him, efficiency is paramount. His department follows a comprehensive manual of procedures that he himself developed. No deviation is permitted. Making sure that everything runs according to plan, safely, and on time is everything to him, so he tends to be impatient with ideas and methods that deviate from the norm. When asked, “What can we do to increase our bottom line?” he says, “We need to stick with the basics—orderly, reliable processes that have been tested and proven to work. Holding everyone accountable to the documented schedule and procedures we have in place is critical.”</p>
<p class="indent">Catherine is the manager in charge of customer relationships and service, helping customers with any questions, complaints, or requests. She says her job isn’t just about making sure that customers are satisfied, it’s about making sure customers “feel loved.” Those on her staff appreciate that she is a great listener, someone who’s always willing to be a sounding board when they need advice or just want to vent, but sometimes they’re not so clear about her specific goals and expectations. When asked, “What can we do to increase our bottom line?” she says, “We need to engage our customers as well as our employees on a deeper level so that they will feel more connected to what we <a id="page_30"></a>do and know how much we value them. It may mean offering more freebies and perks, but the long-term payoff will be worth it.”</p>
<p class="indent">David is the manager of creative services. He has a knack for thinking up very imaginative, almost unheard-of ideas, but the real reason he is a leader is that he excels at anticipating important trends before anyone else does, and he is good at conceptualizing innovative promotion and marketing ideas that others can flesh out. Because he prefers to act on his gut instinct, he sometimes overlooks small but critical details. When asked, “What can we do to increase our bottom line?” he says, “We need to be more on the ‘bleeding edge’ of our industry if we want to stand out. What’s the next big thing? We have to be there before the competition even thinks of it, and that means we can’t get keep getting bogged down by overengineered processes and procedures.”</p>
<p class="indent">These managers give you an idea of possible managerial styles for each separate quadrant of the Whole Brain Model. (See <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a> for further detail on different management styles.) Keep in mind that in an attempt to delineate purely A, B, C, and D styles, extremes of the norm are given. People with a preference for a single quadrant represent only 5 percent of the HBDI assessment data, and even those with a strong preference for one quadrant have and use the other three less-preferred quadrants. In fact, most managers—and most people in general (95 percent of the HBDI database)—prefer two or more quadrants.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Understanding the Individual Quadrants</h4>
<p class="noindentb1">Even though most people don’t typically work within the individual quadrants in isolation, the easiest way to get a sense of each quadrant’s influence, as well as the relative compatibilities and incompatibilities among preferences, is to take a look at each of them separately. Each of the following descriptions of the individual quadrants shows one of the four selves in isolation so that you can better understand and differentiate them. As you read, think about which of these quadrants most apply to you.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>The A-quadrant self favors activities that involve analyzing, dissecting, figuring out, solving problems logically, simplifying the complex, and getting facts.</strong> It uses phrases like, “Time is money,” and relies on logic based on certain assumptions, combined with an ability to perceive, verbalize, and express things precisely. The A self will calculate risk and won’t move forward if it is excessively high. Argument is more important than personal experience, facts trump intuition, and emotion is to be avoided. The A self’s abilities to generalize from the <a id="page_31"></a>specific and verbalize those generalizations make it an ideal technical problem solver, but because it lacks attention to emotion, it tends to appear cold, aloof, and arrogant. “A-only” solutions, while logical, will often be impractical because they ignore the very real barriers of (for example) dealing with human inertia or fixed attitudes. Their logic will chain them to the ground, because they won’t make the creative leap required to set a new direction.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>The B self is very detailed, structured, solid, and down-to-earth, with no equivocation or ambiguity</strong>. B onlys bear a number of similarities to their cousins in the A quadrant, but there are significant differences. For the B self, efficiency is about making sure things are done on time and correctly, down to the last detail. There are no shortcuts. The A self devises formulas, while the B self tests them. The B self has little patience with or respect for the intellectual complexities that the A self finds so compelling. When you want to get things done, and when perfection in detail is critical, the B self is the answer to your prayers. The B self will focus on one thing at a time and get it right the first time. However, because the B self shows little room for intuition, ambiguity, and emotion, others tend to view it as domineering, controlling, small-minded, boring, insensitive, and antisocial. Its ultimate desire is for order and dependability, to preserve the tried and true, even though that may ultimately defeat progress.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>The C-quadrant self is highly participative and team-oriented, and considers people to be the most important aspect</strong>. When the mood of an individual or group changes, the C self is immediately aware of this and responsive to it. Not in the least linear in functioning, the C self has little time for logic or theory. Experience is reality, goals mean nothing if they violate human processes, and personal satisfaction is the prime measure of success. Because of its faith in groups and its openness to each person’s contributions, the C self tends to be viewed as agreeable, nice to have around, and supportive. But it can be flaky, undisciplined, overly sentimental, and impractical because it refuses to deal with facts, goals, time, and money. Most of what the C self talks about is hard to verbalize, so connection and flow become more important than content. Others can become frustrated by the unfocused, continual talk.</p>
<p class="noindentlt"><strong>The D self is intuitive, holistic, adventurous, and risk taking</strong>. It speaks in metaphors and thrives on the excitement of new ideas, possibilities, variety, incongruities, and questions that sound obvious but actually go <a id="page_32"></a>the heart of the matter. The D self tends to be a true visionary, in the best sense of the word, but often has trouble working with others because it’s largely nonverbal and has difficulty explaining things or putting concepts into words. Lacking the C quadrant’s need to connect, the D self doesn’t want to slow down to the speed that’s necessary for everyone else to catch up, and it doesn’t want to spend energy on developing structure. The D self dislikes structure, words, and logic because it feels that all of these get in the way of the flow of ideas and energy—as does the here and now, whether it’s the B self’s details and procedures or the C self’s emotional grounding.</p>
<p class="indentt">As you can see, these are the extremes of the four quadrants. You are a combination of the styles and most likely prefer more than one quadrant. Looking at the “selves” preferences individually, however, shows how each has both advantages and disadvantages, strengths and blind spots. All of them are necessary in business, and together, they make up the universe of thinking style preferences (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03fig2">Figure 3-2</a>) in an organization. You can also begin to see how your own thinking preferences influence what courses you enjoyed most in school, your career choices, and how you work best with others to get things done.</p>

<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_33"></a>Preference Is Not the Same as Competence</h4>
<p class="noindent">A preference for a given activity and the competency required to perform that activity are not the same thing. I can do bookkeeping very well (competency), but I don’t like it (preference). Some people love to sing but can’t carry a tune. Preference is a matter of attraction; competence to perform a given task comes through training and experience. Competence can be developed to reasonable or even superior levels whether or not the person is attracted to the task (necessity can be the mother of competency). But true expertise and world-class competence are achieved almost exclusively in our areas of preference.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Marcus Aurelius</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">That being said, preferences commonly are correlated with competence because people tend to do best at what they like best. We willingly repeat, and thus reinforce, those tasks that we feel good about doing and that we can star in. It’s more difficult and less fun to strive for competence in activities that we’d rather avoid. As applied in business, our thinking patterns lead to the development of preferences, which in turn influence our interests, which most often lead to the development of our competencies, influencing our career choices and ultimately the work that we do.</p>
<p class="indent">A good way to separate preferences and competences is to think back to a time when you were in school and studying a subject that you really, really loved. In my case, it was physics and music. The boundless energy and interest that you felt for a favorite subject would be more like a preference. Having that interest did not necessarily mean that you automatically developed skills and competencies—just that you were interested and that your mind engaged easily and tended to be energized when you were involved in that type of activity.</p>
<p class="indentbt">When we talk about these kinds of activities in relation to work, we’re referring to the ones that are so interesting, so stimulating, and so pleasurable to do that you would select them for these special attributes over other work that was offered to you. They may not be the easiest activities to perform, but in all cases, they are more satisfying and fulfilling, and therefore, the ones you would select if you were given a choice. This is the kind of work that doesn’t require constant external rewards because doing the work is reward in itself.</p>
<p class="bulletab"><span class="gray">•</span> <em>Take a moment to think about what work activities satisfy you most.</em></p>
<p class="indentbt">On the flip side, think of a subject in school that you really disliked. For me, it was chemistry. Although I had grown up in a family of chemists and was “expected” to follow in their footsteps, I struggled to get engaged or perform <a id="page_34"></a>in my chemistry classes, and this affected my ability to develop competencies. Maybe you hated math. You may have developed a competency in basic math, but a considerable amount of energy and motivation were probably required, especially for any advanced math courses. The experience is similar to your professional life when your work requires you to perform activities in those areas that you prefer the least. While we can and do develop competencies in areas of lesser preference, this often requires more effort or energy than developing skills in an area of greater preference.</p>
<p class="bulletab"><span class="gray">•</span> <em>What work activities do you enjoy the least that require the most motivation and energy?</em></p>
<p class="indent">Having now read the descriptions of the different thinking preferences, you are probably guessing what areas of thinking you prefer to “live” in. The following exercises will help you further understand your preferences and how they correlate with your competencies, your performance, and ultimately your career choice.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle1"><strong>Put It to Work:</strong></p>
<p class="sidebartitle">Working Inside and Outside Your Zones of Preference</p>
<p class="noindentb"><strong>Exercise A:</strong> Write down the subject that you liked least in school. Now imagine that you have been offered a highly lucrative opportunity that will require you to put everything else on hold and do nothing but work related to that subject for the next two years.</p>
<p class="bullet">• What are your first thoughts upon hearing this?</p>
<p class="bullet">• Would you take the opportunity?</p>
<p class="bullet">• If your life depended on it, <em>could</em> you do the work?</p>
<p class="bulletb">• If so, what would be required for you to complete the project successfully?</p>
<p class="noindentb"><strong>Exercise B:</strong> List the key tasks that are required of you in performing your current job.</p>
<p class="noindentb"><img src="3line.jpg" alt="Images" width="650" height="83"/></p>
<p class="bullet">• Circle those that you enjoy the most.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Place a checkmark next to those that you have an adequate level of competency to perform well.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Now underline the activities that you don’t enjoy or that you enjoy the least.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_35"></a>Think about ways you can modify your current role to better accommodate your preferences and career goals. Keep in mind that the work that you don’t enjoy or that does not represent a current competency typically represents a learning opportunity, which often requires motivation!</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">If you love what you do, you will never work another day in your life.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Anonymous</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">These kinds of exercises help you begin to uncover clues to your preferences and also to see how competence and preference, while different, are linked. You <em>can</em> work outside your zone of preference, but it will take an enormous amount of effort and motivation. If you are drawn to work that focuses on the human connection and being sensitive to people’s needs, you may find it uncomfortable to make decisions based on cold, hard facts. However, aspects of your job may require it, so you learn how to do it. People often describe this process of developing competencies in areas of lesser preference as building a muscle that feels totally unpracticed and underdeveloped, just like working out at the gym. Working within a zone of preference, on the other hand, may also be challenging, but you won’t feel as if you’re operating from a place of total discomfort. “This is going to be a challenge,” you might think, “but I won’t hate the ride.”</p>
<p class="indent">As you consider the activities you are stimulated by—the ones you really love—and those you dislike, you can begin to see a more complete picture of your mental preferences and how they affect your work and your career choices. There are no right or wrong answers; it’s just that you are more energized by certain kinds of work and more drained by others. The things that stimulate you are usually in strong alignment with your thinking preferences.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the letter and descriptors of the quadrants in the Whole Brain Model, each quadrant has its own color (A, blue; B, green; C, red; and D, yellow, as seen on the book jacket flap) that provides an easy-to-remember association. The following description of several colleagues and their relatives working together in a business also includes the quadrant colors.</p>
<p class="indent">John loves activities that involve analysis and logic. When presented with a decision or idea, his motto is, “Just the facts.” This is representative of the A/blue-quadrant thinking preference. But John also finds other kinds of activities stimulating as well. He is attracted to B/green-quadrant activities such as clear procedures, and he likes to keep his office organized. He also enjoys experimental D/yellow-quadrant activities like seeing the big picture and coming up with ideas and new ways to solve problems. However, he finds C/red-quadrant activities, such as taking time to consider the impact of his decisions on people or being sensitive to interpersonal issues, much more draining and requiring of effort.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_36"></a>Susan, however, finds that she is equally stimulated by work in the organized green (B) and interpersonal red (C) quadrants, and that she dislikes activities that fall into the rational blue (A) or experimental yellow (D) quadrant. The reverse is true for her husband and daughter, who are entrepreneurial and technology-oriented, are highly inspired by experimental and feeling work elements, and don’t enjoy organized or analytical work elements.</p>
<p class="indent">The more scientific among you would gravitate toward activities in the A and D quadrants, while those of you who are interested in manufacturing things, selling real estate, or doing social work would probably prefer activities that fall within the bottom half of the Whole Brain Model—the B and C quadrants (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03fig3">Figure 3-3</a>).</p>

<p class="figcap"><small><strong>FIGURE 3-3</strong></small> Representative occupational categories. The array of professional occupations shown across the Whole Brain Model.</p>
<p class="indent">And then there will be a few of you who are stimulated by work tasks within each of the four quadrants. This more distributed selection is typical of CEOs, general managers, and executive assistants, to name a few—people whose jobs demand a broader understanding of the wide world of thinking preferences.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_37"></a>The exercises and discussion in this book do not attempt to provide a sophisticated and validated assessment of your thinking styles, of the sort that the HBDI provides. However, they will reveal the <em>general trend and direction</em> of your preferences. The HBDI will pinpoint your thinking preferences, and the resulting profile report will provide more detailed data about how you prefer to think and how you can apply this information to your personal and professional life. In the meantime, the following section provides an overview so you’ll be able to interpret the references to the HBDI throughout the book.</p>

<h4 class="h4a">How to Understand and Apply the HBDI Thinking Preference Data</h4>
<p class="noindent">In order to grasp the meaning of all the thinking style trends and patterns you’ll explore in the examples in this book, you should know what the HBDI Profile is, what it indicates, and how to interpret the examples of HBDI Profiles so that you can apply this work to your own needs. While you do not need to have your HBDI to understand or apply Whole Brain Thinking concepts, you’ll find that the HBDI Profile grid is an effective method of displaying and describing the degrees of preference for the quadrants when you apply the concepts to yourself and those you work with.</p>
<p class="indent">The HBDI, which millions of people around the world have completed, charts your location in the world of thinking style preferences and was designed specifically for use in business. It can be used to describe individual preferences as well as a wide variety of mental processes, from team operations and customer viewpoints to corporate culture and branding.</p>
<div class="sidebar">

<p class="att"><strong>—Thomas Mann</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The results of the 120-question HBDI are revealed in a profile displayed on a four-quadrant grid that emulates the four principal thinking structures in the brain. In the east (left)/west (right) positions are those preferences that are more rational and structured (left) and intuitive and holistic (right) ways of thinking. In the north/south positions are those ways of thinking that are referred to as upper (north) and lower (south). The upper modes consist of cognitive and intellectual ways of thinking, and the lower modes encompass visceral, and instinctive ways of thinking.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_38"></a>The four-quadrant display on the left of <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03fig4">Figure 3-4</a> is an example of a typical HBDI Profile. The model in the middle is the Four Selves Model, which describes the coalition of our thinking selves in a more behavioral way. The model on the right is the Whole Brain Model, which is the conceptual and structural basis of the profile grid.</p>

<p class="indent">Remember, the HBDI displays mental <em>preferences</em>, not abilities or competencies. However, as we discussed earlier, there is a strong relationship between preferences and competencies in that one typically leads to the other (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03fig5">Figure 3-5</a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch03fig5"></a><a id="page_40"></a><img src="f0040-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="444" height="252"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><small><strong>FIGURE 3-5</strong></small> Relationship between preferences and competencies and all the phases in-between.</p>
<p class="indent">As you review the typical occupations displayed in <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03fig6">Figure 3-6</a>, keep in mind that a preference for a particular thinking style and an avoidance of another style are of equal consequence and have equal impact on an individual. Your preference(s), particularly a very strong preference, will typically be associated with the work you most enjoy. In contrast, a lack of preference or an equal avoidance in a quadrant implies dislike for some or all of the work elements in that particular quadrant. Being stimulated by work is highly motivational and often represents a state of self-actualization. Being repelled by it is highly demotivational unless you have a very specific incentive and drive to pursue that work. For these reasons, the HBDI Profile is quite predictive of a person’s potential acquisition of competencies and engagement in work. You will tend focus your energies and efforts on building competencies in the areas you are attracted to mentally. <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03fig6">Figure 3-6</a> is a partial universe of profiles and likely occupations.</p>

<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>360s and Preferences</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">The 360-degree assessment is a tool that many companies have used for measuring behaviors as part of the process of building a learning and development plan. But can individuals build the <em>right</em> developmental plans without understanding how they and others think? One of the challenges with the way 360s are often conducted is that they are done out of context—without taking the thinking preferences of both the rater and the person being rated into account—and we know that the brain misinterprets data it receives out of context. If the rater is focused on organized B-quadrant activities like timelines and detailed procedures, that is what she will tend to pay most attention to, and the ratings will reflect that orientation. This doesn’t mean that someone with a D-quadrant experimental mindset isn’t getting things done correctly and on time—he might just be using a more unconventional approach to get there.</p>

<p class="indent">Trish and Frank could hardly bear to sit next to each other at the monthly association board meetings. As the board discussed proposed actions to increase membership and retention, all Frank would listen to was quantitative analysis; if there was none, he wouldn’t consider taking action. In addition, he wanted to know every detail in advance, well before anything could be implemented.</p>
<p class="indent">Trish, on the other hand, was brimming with ideas for increasing member retention and engagement, but her “data” were qualitative. She spent much of her time talking with members and knew intuitively what they needed and wanted.</p>
<p class="indent">Trish felt attacked by Frank’s constant requests for data and details. Frank found Trish’s desire to brainstorm and discuss ideas at every meeting to be self-serving and a waste of precious meeting time.</p>
<p class="indent">The board president, Maria, felt like a referee, constantly blocking and tackling the frequent disputes. She fully understood each perspective and tried to “translate” between them. She was torn, because she knew that both had value. She could jump from brainstorming to data discussions easily, which sometimes frustrated the other board members.</p>
<p class="indentb1">Meetings became more and more tense until everyone began to hate the meetings!</p>
<p class="number">1. Guess Who’s Who:</p>
<p class="numbull">• Which profile is Trish’s?</p>
<p class="numbull">• Which is Frank’s?</p>
<p class="numbull">• Which is Maria’s?</p>
<p class="number"><a id="page_43"></a>2. Look at the shape of each profile and identify the quadrant with the most prominent preference. Under normal, everyday circumstances, this quadrant will be the direction of that person or group’s preferred mode of thinking.</p>
<p class="numbull">• What would be Profile X’s preferred mode? How would that show up in behavior? What about Profile Y? Profile Z?</p>
<p class="number">3. Look for the second-most-preferred quadrant of the profile. If the first and second both have strong scores, the combination of the most-and second-most-preferred quadrants results in a preferred <em>mode</em>, such as left, right, upper, or lower.</p>
<p class="numbull">• What second-most-preferred quadrants or modes do Trish, Frank, and Maria most prefer?</p>
<p class="numbulli">• Trish</p>
<p class="numbulli">• Frank</p>
<p class="numbulli">• Maria</p>
<p class="number">4. Look for the least-preferred quadrant. Often the lack of preference for a particular thinking style is just as important as the strong preferences. A strong preference indicates the likelihood of a person’s being stimulated by a particular style, while the absence of preference, particularly if it is a score of 33 or less, indicates the possibility of an individual’s having a strong dislike for that style. In many cases, both of these conditions are visible to family members, colleagues, and friends.</p>
<p class="numbull">• How are the lowest preferences affecting the working relationship between Trish and Frank?</p>
<p class="number">5. Look for strong preferences in opposing quadrants, such as B/D and A/C. These profiles often represent internal conflicts as individuals make decisions or react to everyday situations. For example, in the case of the B/D profile, a person could be on the one hand imaginative, holistic, and risk taking and at the same time detailed, traditional, or organized. In other words, such a person has one foot on the accelerator and the other foot on the brake.</p>
<p class="numbull">• Was this type of profile present in the board? How did it help or hinder the challenge?</p>
<p class="number">6. Look for profiles that are very balanced, with relatively equal scores in all four quadrants. Such a profile represents a relatively equal distribution of preferences and therefore a balanced distribution of interests, skills, abilities, and competencies. This is extremely rare. Only 3 percent of our database of individuals has a primary preference in all four quadrants.</p>
<p class="numbull">• Who has the balanced profile?</p>
<p class="numbulli"><span class="gray">•</span> What challenges does this profile present for the individual?</p>
<p class="numbulli"><span class="gray">•</span> Were there any advantages?</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_44"></a>In all cases, the profiles displayed in this book represent actual data, whether they are those of an individual or a group average. <em>Note:</em> When profiles are labeled “pro forma,” the data are inferred by applying a diagnostic technique based on the Whole Brain Thinking framework.</p>

<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  There is a strong relationship between the styles of thinking you prefer and the competencies you acquire and enjoy most.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  The HBDI profiles an individual’s mental preferences across the four quadrants of the Whole Brain Thinking Model, providing a useful means of understanding how preferences affect the person’s work effectiveness.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Hundreds of business occupations have been profiled, and norms for those profiles are useful to evaluate and better understand the mental demands of those professions—and your own.</p>
