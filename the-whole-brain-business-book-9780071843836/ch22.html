<h4 class="h4">What’s Holding Back Creativity in Business?</h4>
<p class="noindent">The senior leader of a Fortune 100 company had delivered a clear directive: “We need new ideas to change the culture here so that people will see we’re serious about innovation.”</p>
<p class="indent">Looking to increase the quantity and quality of new ideas to improve results at one of the company’s regional plants, this leader had formed a team and given it the task of changing the creative climate at the plant. The team was excited about the challenge and dove in with full force. One of its proposals included designing a “creative space” where employees could go to change their perspective and mental state away from the day-to-day “noise,” find resources to stimulate their creativity, meet with others for idea generation, and get their creative juices fired up or recharged. The team members had studied this concept and found data to substantiate its effectiveness—especially <a id="page_312"></a> in cultures where people found it very difficult to shift their thinking at their workspace. I was asked to help in the design.</p>
<p class="indent">The team had very little budget, but it was able to locate a mostly unused room that, with a little freshening up, would do the trick. Team members eagerly rounded up volunteers to clean and repaint the room and solicited donations internally and from friends and family for creative objects and furniture to decorate it. I was so impressed with the creativity this team was generating to get this project done, with so little budget, that I happily donated a painting I had painted of a local forest to contribute to the “space.” Once the room was complete, it had a delightful array of comfortable chairs and seating options, books, music, and creativity-inspiring objects such as materials for creative modeling, toys, interesting artifacts, and crafts. The team members held an inaugural ceremony featuring a dedication by the senior management sponsor, and buzz and excitement abounded about how this location was truly committed to changing the culture. After all, here was a tangible sign that creative ideas were encouraged!</p>
<p class="indent">A month later, I made a trip to the plant, anxious to visit the room and see how it was going. Much to my surprise, the door was locked and there was no one in sight. I sought out the team lead, and he looked at me with frustration in his eyes as he told me: “It’s our SOP. Our standard operating procedures don’t allow us to leave the creativity room open, and the procedure for requesting the key is so cumbersome that no one is using it! I’ve tried to get an exception for the room, but they claim we can’t do that. The worst part is, this is sending a strong negative message to the organization: ‘We have it, but you can’t use it.’ It’s awful! I almost wish we’d never done it now.”</p>
<p class="indent">As silly as it sounds, one of the biggest barriers to creativity in business is the day-to-day culture, the existing norms of that business.</p>
<h4 class="h4">The Stumbling Blocks: Are They All in Our Heads?</h4>
<p class="noindent">“More than rigor, management discipline, integrity, or even vision—successfully navigating an increasing complex world will require creativity.” This quote from IBM’s 2010 Global CEO study, which surveyed 1,500 CEOs from 60 countries and 33 industries, made it crystal clear: creativity is a business requirement in today’s world. Since then, CEOs have continued to make speeches proclaiming a “fresh commitment to new ideas and more creativity” and urging an entrepreneurial approach to business. But has much really changed? We talk about emulating the Steve Jobses of the world, studying the latest new technology innovators, hiring those who can come up with clever solutions, or creating breakthrough new products that will transform entire markets and industries.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_313"></a>So why are the results so consistently disappointing?</p>
<p class="indent">There are a number of reasons, but first and foremost, these CEOs are calling for more risk-oriented, nontraditional, disruptive, D-quadrant-style thinking, while, given the stress of today’s environment, the management organization is even more likely to be thinking in rational, safekeeping, risk-avoidance, and stewardship terms—primarily A- and B-quadrant-oriented thinking. They may latch onto a concept like Design Thinking because it represents the “latest and greatest,” and they may find the process and structure appealing, but that’s where the real <em>adoption</em> ends because the culture is just not ready. The requisite risk taking and nonlinear connecting points are too far outside their comfort zones, or, as we saw in the previous example, other cultural norms and procedures take precedence. As a result, companies usually end up applying dollars that were supposed to be allocated to creative efforts to shoring up the existing product line rather than exploring something that is truly new. Any change that does happen is incremental rather than breakthrough.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">When opposites supplement each other, everything is harmonious.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Lao Tzu</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The frustrated CEO asks: “What must I do to get new thinking from my people? I tell them what I want, but nothing changes!” The managers appear to understand, and they applaud sincerely, but this is too much of a risky-feeling mental stretch for them to implement, especially in the current environment. Many of them have been hired, trained, and rewarded for operating in an A/B environment, and now, when they’re being exhorted to bring in their C/D thinking preferences as well, they don’t know how to respond effectively. They feel uncomfortable and insecure when they are operating in modes that they neither trust nor understand. And for those who are more naturally inclined to think this way—often those who are rising up through the ranks and who view the world from a younger generational perspective—the challenge is daunting in a different way. Unless they’re working for a company like Google, where “Googlers” are still encouraged to spend 20 percent of their time on projects of their own interest (although the company has added more guidelines in recent years), these employees find that they hit a wall when they try to pitch a new idea to the layer of management they report to. So they ask themselves, “How do I actually pursue creative thinking in a culture that is so unwilling to listen to new ideas, an environment that is so hard to change, with leaders who don’t get it?” Going forward, this new generation will be less prone to join or stick around in an environment that does not meet their creative needs. The lesson for organizations is clear: to continue to attract and retain the talent you need if <a id="page_314"></a>you are to remain successful, it’s essential that you have a full commitment— at all levels—to creative thinking and the value it brings to the business.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, in most business contexts, the creative process is often thought of and labeled as problem solving. Although the application of creative thinking to problems has value, culturally it means that an issue has to be judged to be a problem—something negative—in order to evoke a creative response. People forget that defining and meeting a need may have more to do with seeing an opportunity (a plus) than with defining a problem (a negative).</p>
<p class="indent">Compounding the issue, most people think of problem solving as what has been incorrectly labeled a “left-brain” process—orderly and straightforward, a step-by-step analysis and application of logic. That view of the process takes off the table a wide array of enormously effective C- and D-mode techniques and activities, such as having empathy, modeling, simulating, doodling, drawing on intuition, thinking metaphorically, and synthesizing (combining things to create something new with worth that far surpasses the total of what each idea could be worth separately)—C- and D-oriented techniques that produce the visions and thinking that power truly innovative contributions.</p>
<p class="indent">Another common stumbling block is that creativity often gets relegated to (or is viewed as) the domain of a particular function or individuals. It’s what the people in R&amp;D or marketing do, or perhaps product development. This is also true of the term <em>innovation</em>, which is considered the lofty domain of a select few, perhaps those in R&amp;D, not a required thinking skill for all. (See <a class="nounder" href="ch21.html#ch21">Chapter 21</a> for more on the differences between innovation and creativity.)</p>
<p class="indent">Creativity and innovation exist and need to be cultivated in every corner of our organizations. The problem is that they are often hidden and even discouraged. We need to make it safe and provide a platform for those contributions to be heard—whether they’re coming from IT, human resources, finance, sales, or management. A “fail fast, fail cheap” approach helps make it acceptable for people to pilot ideas, to test things … and to fail safely.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Edwin Land</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">And finally, although leaders ask for creativity and say that they value it, in the do-more-with-less world where there never seems to be enough time or resources to get things done, creativity becomes viewed as a nice-to-have, the “fluff,” or work that can happen only outside office hours, not the “real work.” The irony? Do-more-with-less is a condition that’s screaming out for creativity. Imagine how much more we could ultimately get done if we sanctioned that creative time!</p>
<p class="indent">So what can we do about this? We need the climate, champions, and support for creativity as a key ingredient for business success.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_315"></a>Creating the Right Climate</h4>
<p class="noindent">Some years ago, we conducted an HBDI thinking preference study of more than 5,000 employees across a broad range of divisions and functions within a large chemical company. The company was struggling to do more with less and felt that a lack of innovation had become pervasive. The HBDI data revealed that although “creative” ranked fifth out of twenty-five characteristics as a key descriptor for employees when they described how they see themselves in general, it ranked fifteenth out of sixteen as a work element! In other words, creativity wasn’t the problem; creativity <em>on the job</em> was the problem. The company was hiring people who saw themselves as creative, but clearly, the climate of this company did not support creative and innovative thinking, so it was most likely that creative pursuits were happening outside of work.</p>
<p class="indent">A plan was put in place, driven by the CEO and senior management, to very visibly shift the culture using training, performance systems, and consistent messaging. A critical component of the success of this initiative was the internal champions who kept it going deep inside divisions across the globe. Such champions already exist in every company we have worked with; however, they typically are not highly visible if the culture is one that thwarts innovation. The steps in the box that follows will help you find and get the most out of the creative process champions in your organization.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>Ten Steps for Establishing Creative Process Champions and Whole Brain Problem-Solving/Opportunity-Finding Teams</strong></p>
<p class="numberlist1">  1. Arrange for senior management sponsorship.</p>
<p class="numberlist1">  2. Solicit and identify interested candidates.</p>
<p class="numberlist1">  3. Invite the candidates to learn about their thinking preferences by administering the HBDI assessment.</p>
<p class="numberlist1">  4. Gauge the breadth of their existing creative process expertise and the degree of alignment between their thinking preferences and the mentality of the creative processes in which they have expertise. If the level of existing expertise is inadequate or too limited, arrange for the needed training and development to help them achieve mastery of a broader array of creative processes. Note: It is not necessary to limit the creative processes to the quadrants of greatest preference—your ultimate objective is to have a broad selection of preferences and creative processes available on the team.</p>
<p class="numberlist1"><a id="page_316"></a>  5. Arrange and get buy-in and support from direct reporting management for the creative process champions to be given temporary assignment to a creative process problem-solving team.</p>
<p class="numberlist1">  6. When a major opportunity where new thinking is needed or a tough challenge or problem occurs, select from the pool of creative process champions a group of five or six who represent a composite Whole Brain group with the mix of expertise that would optimize the solution to that major problem or opportunity.</p>
<p class="numberlist1">  7. Arrange for meetings between the creative process champions and the owner(s) of the problem or opportunity to gather data and define scope, timelines, and so on. Make sure that the owner(s) are available to consult with the team during the process to answer additional questions or provide needed information.</p>
<p class="numberlist1">  8. Let the role of leader be determined by the team. If there is a “problem or opportunity owner,” make sure that person is part of the team. The team may want to have that person serve as the team leader, if it’s appropriate.</p>
<p class="numberlist1">  9. Provide the team with a dedicated time, space and tools (both online and other) to apply its creative mastery. Include an online shared workspace as well as a physical meeting location that has a full spectrum of resources, including creative materials to support model making and experimentation with alternative solutions.</p>
<p class="numberlist1">10. Make it easy for the team to communicate its solution recommendations to the senior management problem or opportunity owners if they are not members of the team.</p>
</div>
<p class="indentb">Here are some additional considerations to take into account in creating a climate that will support the creative process, particularly when heterogeneous teams are involved:</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="gray">•</span> Creativity needs to be free of too much control and overscheduling. This requires a culture of trust and flexibility.</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="gray">•</span> Creativity is an inefficient process from a productivity standpoint. It may feel “messy.” This is normal. The more you structure it, the faster you shut it down.</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="gray">•</span> Creative results cannot be guaranteed on demand. Build this into your planning.</p>
<p class="bullet"><span class="gray">•</span> Mistakes will be made. Create a safe environment that focuses on learning from them instead of punishing for them. Mistakes and the learning from them is an essential part of the creative process.</p>
<p class="bulletb"><a id="page_317"></a><span class="gray">•</span> Interpersonal relationships may be stressed by the creative contention. Prepare those who are involved by helping them understand the importance of thinking diversity and skills to best handle it.</p>
<p class="indent">It is essential that the manager who is in charge of a creative team first establish a climate that encourages diversity of thinking, tolerates ambiguity, and is flexible in terms of schedule, outcomes, and personal behaviors. This climate must allow for a fundamentally messy process to take place in an otherwise orderly organization. When traditional business approaches to encouraging innovation don’t work, management has been known to take a chance on nontraditional ones. Generally speaking, these approaches are outside the regular corporate system, so in many cultures, a special place must be found for them within a facility that allows people to be authentic in their work habits (such as flexible work hours and/or relaxed dress codes, if that is not already the norm), and that visibly differs from the daily work habits and facilities of the parent organization.</p>

<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>Put It to Work</strong></p>
<p class="noindentb">Resist the temptation to fall back on brainstorming as the only tool in your creative toolkit; it rarely provides needed results. Try this exercise to expand your creative toolkit:</p>
<p class="bullet">• Review the creative processes in <a class="nounder" href="ch22.html#ch22fig1">Figure 22-1</a>, and look for two or three processes that you have never tried before, but that sound intriguing.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Take the initiative to find out more about those processes (for example, search online).</p>
<p class="bullet">• Now think of a challenge you have at home or at work. Apply the first process, then the second.</p>
<p class="bulleti"><span class="gray">•</span> What did you learn?</p>
<p class="bulleti"><span class="gray">•</span> How do the results of the different processes differ from one another?</p>
<p class="bulleti"><span class="gray">•</span> How were the experiences different from your usual approach to creativity?</p>
<p class="bulleti"><span class="gray">•</span> Was the process uncomfortable or comfortable for you? Do you notice a correlation with your comfort zones of thinking?</p>
<p class="bullet">• Every time you have a challenge, try another process. Involve others, too. You’ll discover that it can really be fun to engage in creative thinking when you have some fresh tools in your toolkit.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 22-1</small></strong> Categorizing 82 creative processes in terms of the Whole Brain Model.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_318"></a>I can guarantee that this approach really works. We have worked with several organizations using an accelerated process called Whole Brain Hackathons to get the best possible solutions as quickly as possible, drawing on an array of processes across the Whole Brain Model.

</div>
<h4 class="h4a">Managing the People Responsible for Creative Work</h4>
<p class="noindent">Even though applied creativity is by its nature a Whole Brain process, some of the visible behavior characteristics of people who need to be part of the process are consistent with C/D thinking, particularly D-quadrant qualities. People doing this type of creative work often have a low tolerance for rules and regulations and resist being closely supervised on the basis of detailed step-by-step processes. They are more inclined to break rules than to make rules. They <a id="page_319"></a>are more likely to take risks and experiment. Therefore, the job of “managing” this kind of thinker is always a challenging one. It requires a mixture of trust in the process, patience, encouragement, and realistic goals.</p>
<p class="indent">The job of many managers, however, is to run a “tight ship” by monitoring quality, maintaining consistency, and providing the structure and control that minimizes variability. The differences between these two approaches are so sharply defined that we are dealing with oil and water. When creative thinking is part of the job description, leaders, managers, and supervisors need to be sensitive to the conditions under which the creative process can be most productive. The best way to lead and manage those who are responsible for creative thinking is to be clear about the objectives and deadlines from the start and then manage them with some distance. Placing too many rules and conditions on the individuals will inhibit the natural flow that is necessary to creativity. Although it may seem inefficient to incubate ideas or potential solutions, it actually takes less work and time when you create a safe environment.</p>
<p class="indentb">The styles that are typical of a technical supervisor/manager may be perilous to the creative solution. When managing a creative person or team, steer away from:</p>
<p class="numberlist2">1. Too much close supervision or micromanagement, which stifles the free flow of unusual ideas.</p>
<p class="numberlist2">2. Strict adherence to procedures that will inhibit people’s ability to pursue the natural free flow associated with creative thinking. (Remember the locked creativity room at the beginning of this chapter?)</p>
<p class="numberlist2b">3. Application of quantitative performance measures too early in the process, before there are enough data to measure.</p>
<p class="indent">Even though applied Whole Brain Creativity requires some of these more A/B-oriented disciplines in order to define, follow through, and implement creative ideas, those on the creative team will often ultimately perform these steps themselves because of their self-motivation. If you state the desired outcomes at the beginning, there should be no need for close supervisory techniques. By striking a balance between firm project control and a totally open-ended and undefined process, the manager in charge of the creative team can promote productivity instead of hampering it. What’s essential is having the conversation up front and making sure that both parties clearly understand and buy into it.</p>
<div class="sidebar">

<p class="att"><strong>—Mark Twain</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_320"></a>It is important to emphasize this point, because our HBDI database indicates that the thinking-style norm for lower- and middle-level managers, while more multidominant than in the past, is still more strongly left-mode, A/B-oriented than C/D-oriented. Therefore, the management styles of this population tend to go against the grain of what is needed in the early stages of the creative process. Typically, it is only at the higher levels of the organization that creativity and innovation become legitimized. It is at these higher levels that you might find leaders who are themselves creative champions and who begin to encourage and even sponsor creative behavior. Because many of the processes inherent in creativity and innovation typically conflict with the mental preferences of operational managers, supervisors, and the culture at large, both leaders who attempt to change an embedded culture like this and rising potential creative champions feel as if they are running into a brick wall. In this case, some sort of company-wide creativity campaign may be required.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Creativity and innovation are about finding unexpected solutions to obvious problems, or finding obvious solutions to unexpected problems. We should use our creativity to provide better businesses and solutions rather than constantly trying to disrupt what people are doing.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Rei Inamot, Chief Creative Officer, AKQA</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Changes that would allow the creative and innovative potential of the organization to be unleashed would first require a top-down, company-wide culture-changing educational program that provides needed understanding to everyone in the organization, including managers, supervisors, and plant managers, as well as knowledge workers and frontline production workers. Several of our clients have created award programs, videos, and case examples to prove the worthiness of pursuing creativity and innovation. And in parallel with that, I would suggest an educational program that reveals the nature and source of creativity and innovation and how everyone can pursue it and contribute through application. You do not have to be Google to have company-specific initiatives and programs that designate time and resources for <a id="page_321"></a> new ideas, but you must be clear about how each individual can contribute. Until individuals understand who they are and why they do the things they do and the way they do them, creativity will remain a mystery, and the resulting thinking and ideas that are so critical to sustaining a competitive advantage in today’s environment will remain out of the company’s reach.</p>

<h4 class="h4a">Generating and Managing “Killer” Business Ideas: A Case Study</h4>
<p class="noindent">Several years ago, the Australian arm of global liquor giant Brown-Forman, manufacturer and marketer of some of the best-known spirits in the world, including Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whisky and Southern Comfort, came to our colleagues in Australia with a challenge: although the company had a robust process in place—dubbed “ideation”—to generate new marketing ideas, the ideas it was producing were typically only one step removed from what it was already doing. They were good ideas, but they weren’t, as the representatives put it, “killer” ideas. They told our team that they wanted not just to start thinking outside the existing continuum but also to learn to think <em>way outside</em> their comfort zones to make their ideation process even more effective.</p>
<p class="indent">This was a highly energized group with a relatively broad spectrum of HBDI Profiles, as one would expect, although there was an overall bias toward the C- and D-quadrant preferences. Michael Morgan of Herrmann International Asia describes some of the process he used with the team.<sup><a id="ch22end1a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch22end1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">This approach to “ideation facilitation” is rooted in Whole Brain Creativity and goes well beyond what many companies refer to as “brainstorming.” Although the process is carefully planned, with specific, closely managed steps, the participants don’t necessarily notice this. They quickly get caught up in the spirit of a sometimes zany and wacky, but at all times highly stimulating exercise. Importantly, each of the steps is rooted in Whole Brain Thinking to ensure that people understand their own and others’ thinking preferences and therefore work together better and more creatively.</p>
<p class="indent">For Brown-Forman, we had to address some very clear needs and generate ideas around some very specific business issues. We had to help the company define and if necessary redefine its objectives in more creative ways and then take it through a process of idea generation, verification, and prioritization.</p>
<p class="indent">My basic philosophy in taking people through this process is that the human brain is absolutely useless in coming up with ideas, but is brilliant at making connections. If someone has you sitting in a blank room and says, “Give me 20 ideas on how to decorate a birthday cake,” most people would struggle to come up with five, and none of them would be what you’d call “breakthrough.” However, if I said, “Come up with 20 ideas on how to decorate a birthday cake, <a id="page_322"></a>and here is a book of <em>Ripley’s Believe It or Not</em><sup><a id="ch22end2a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch22end2">2</a></sup> stories that I want you to look through to get some ideas,” we would end up with the most amazing cake with all sorts of things jumping out of it.</p>
<p class="indent">It is the same as saying to a group of people, as happens far too often in corporate life, “Go away and brainstorm for 20 minutes and come up with ideas on how to solve this problem.” Most people will attempt to obey the instruction. but they generally won’t come up with stunning ideas. That is why our idea generation techniques are designed to stimulate people to find different ways to define issues and challenges and then to come up with ideas by making connections.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, I’ve found that people often rush into idea generation and end up solving the wrong problem. An example I use is, “Oh, dear, the lightbulb has gone out. But I can’t reach the light.” However, if we looked at it another way (“The light is too far away”), we would be more likely to come up with ideas about how to make the light closer—for instance, having it attached to an extendable cord like a Venetian blind so that we can pull it down when we need to. In other words, by redefining the problem and then making connections, we can become far more creative. In a business context, the challenge, “How can we increase sales?” may well become, instead, “How can we help customers buy more?”</p>
<p class="indent">As a means of helping the Brown-Forman team come up with more creative definitions of the problem, I used a technique called “Who? Do? What?” A lot of people find it difficult to come up with wacky ideas, especially if they are logical, rational, and sequential. If they have a wacky thought, most people tend to edit it out. “You can’t have a purple cake,” they say subconsciously.</p>
<p class="indent">So if you want people to have wacky ideas, you must give them a process. And such a process has to appear to be logical to get them out there. Our “Who? Do? What?” is a very logical process that can help people generate hundreds of ideas.</p>
<p class="indent">An example could be: How can we increase sales? (Who = We; Do = Increase; What = Sales.)</p>
<p class="indent">If we just say, “Come up with lots of ideas for increasing sales,” the results will often be boring. However, if we use a whiteboard or butcher’s paper table headed up by “Who? Do? What?,” we can generate lateral thinking by getting the group members to come up with all types of “whos” (we, customers, suppliers, teenagers, policemen, Bugs Bunny … whoever comes to mind).</p>
<p class="indent">Then we get them to fill in the “Do” column, and they may come up with “increase, decrease, accelerate, explode, eradicate, eat, drink, and party.” And then the “Whats”—sales, profits, turnover, carrots, fast cars, and so on. By getting them to randomly connect the items in the three columns, we get them <a id="page_323"></a>to make a whole heap of wacky connections. And, out of those connections, ideas start to spring.</p>
<p class="indentb">Some other techniques for helping people break out of their comfort zones include:</p>
<p class="bulleti"><span class="gray">•</span> <strong>Magic wand thinking.</strong> Ask <em>what if</em> I had a magic wand and was able to solve this problem with no constraints on what the solution might look like or how “off the wall” it might be. What would that solution look like?</p>
<p class="bulletib"><span class="gray">•</span> <strong>TLC.</strong> To turn crazy ideas into actionable solutions, ask: What’s Tempting about this idea? What’s Lacking? What could I Change to make it work?</p>
<p class="indent">At Brown-Forman, a huge number of wacky ideas were whittled down into some killer breakthrough ideas, including one that culminated in the decision to form the Jack Daniel’s V8 Supercar team, which quickly became the sport’s number one merchandise seller. The brand was soon experiencing double-digit growth along with increased awareness, popularity, and loyalty.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Looking for the Positive Deviants</h4>
<p class="noindent">Is the answer you’re looking for already there and you just aren’t looking for it in the right places? The concept of positive deviance was pioneered in the early 1990s, based on the observation that solutions can be found and change can grow from within if we seek out and learn from the “positive deviants” in our organizations—those people who behave differently or use different approaches and strategies that allow them to find better solutions to problems that their peers continue to struggle with, even though they’re all facing similar challenges.</p>

<p class="indent">While it might seem as if it would be easy to identify the uncommon behaviors, this isn’t something that we are likely to do without conscious effort. As explored in the discussion about change in <a class="nounder" href="ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>, mindsets are a powerful thing. We’re guided by those mental maps that are based on our prior experience and knowledge, and this can prevent us from looking around for other options and ideas that might help us solve our problems.</p>
<p class="indent">But let’s say that the out-of-the-ordinary behavior sticks out like a sore thumb, and you just can’t miss it. The next challenge is recognizing its value. Throughout this book, we’ve talked about the mental defaults that can become traps and blind spots. For example, we know that people tend to hire, <a id="page_324"></a>value, and reward the thinking that is most similar to their own. This makes it especially challenging to recognize positive deviance and take advantage of the often ingenious solutions that might be playing out right under our noses.</p>
<p class="indent">In their book on the subject, <em>The Power of Positive Deviance</em>,<sup><a id="ch22end3a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch22end3">3</a></sup> Richard T. Pascale, Jerry Sternin, and Monique Sternin reiterate this point: “As a problem-solving process, this [positive deviance] approach requires retraining ourselves to pay attention differently—awakening minds accustomed to overlooking outliers, and cultivating skepticism about the inevitable ‘that’s just the way it is.’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">Using a Whole Brain approach as part of the deliberate process of identifying positive deviance will give you the best odds of finding, understanding, valuing, and then applying the solutions that may already be working on a smaller scale, hidden in plain sight within your organization.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Action Steps for Increasing Creative Potential and Business Yield</h4>
<p class="numberlist2">1. <strong>Challenge assumptions.</strong> When we are dealing with a problem situation, instead of accepting what somebody tells us or how the problem is stated in writing, or even how we define the problem ourselves, it is creatively healthy to challenge the basis of these statements by questioning the facts upon which they are based or the premise upon which they are based. Our assumptions are often the filters through which we perceive the problem situation. When these are challenged, important new understandings are often revealed. A problem well stated is a problem half solved. There are specific techniques you can learn for better problem definition. Start by asking “How do I_____in order to _____?”</p>
<p class="numberlist2">2. <strong>Recognize your mental defaults.</strong> Perhaps it is because we get “stuck” that we sometimes call creative thinking “out-of-the-box thinking.” Clearly we appear to have an intuitive sense that each of us needs to break out of our natural thinking processes, to “get out of our own box.” Understanding the nature of your thinking preferences, ideally using an HBDI Profile, which shows the different degrees of preference across the four quadrants, provides a new definition of the mental boxes or boundaries we may have created for ourselves.</p>
<p class="indentlp">In fact, as we discussed in detail in <a class="nounder" href="ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>, we each have a set of mental defaults, where we go almost unconsciously when we are faced with a decision or challenge. Once you know what these defaults might be, however, it is much easier to predict and define what your boundaries will be and thus the areas that will be a challenge for you to see differently.</p>
<p class="numberlist2"><a id="page_325"></a>3. <strong>See in new Whole Brain ways.</strong> A client was challenged because its packaging of large light fixtures caused costly breakage. Not only were the costs of the packaging and breakage skyrocketing, but the materials used were difficult to recycle. The team members were sure that they had thought of every possible solution, but using Whole Brain Creativity techniques to get “out of their box,” they devised the idea of packaging the fixtures in garbage cans, which could then be resold. The recycling problem was solved, while costs—and breakage— dropped significantly, all because they were able to see the issue in a new Whole Brain way.</p>
<p class="indentlp">The Problem-Solving Walk-Around (see <a class="nounder" href="ch22.html#ch22fig2">Figure 22-2</a>) deliberately examines a problem (or opportunity) from the perspective of the four quadrants: the logical, rational A quadrant; the organized, procedural B quadrant; the interpersonal, emotional C quadrant; and the experimental, holistic D quadrant. Since most of us have our favorite way of looking at things, based on our thinking preferences, this walk-around technique provides an easy way for us to be facilitated to seeing in new ways.</p>
<p class="numberlist2"><a id="page_326"></a>4. <strong>Make connections.</strong> A high percentage of creative ideas is the result of synergy occurring between two thoughts or perceptions, especially when they cross quadrant boundaries. Making connections between them can stimulate synergy, which will increase the yield of fresh, new ideas. Some of these connections take place naturally, but seeking out different perceptions and forcing a connection between them can often yield creative results. Doing this is, in fact, a distinctly creative process.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things.</p>

<p class="numberlist">5. <strong>Take risks.</strong> Those among us who have a D-quadrant preference often enjoy risk taking and make use of this creative step naturally. Others of us who have preferences in the other quadrants need to overcome our resistance to risk taking. The way to do that is to practice taking small risks on purpose until you achieve a comfort level. In this way, you become more comfortable with risk taking so that it can become a tool in your creativity toolkit. We also need to create cultures of experimentation in our organizations where it is OK to take a risk— and potentially fail, with a focus on learning from those failures for new insight.</p>
<p class="numberlist">6. <strong>Seize upon a chance.</strong> Many people who consider themselves already creative are opportunistic as they engage in a problem-solving or opportunity-finding situation. Their past experience has demonstrated that taking a chance pays off. Others of us who would like to be more creative need to add this, as well as risk taking, to our toolkit. With a little practice, we can improve our responsiveness to creative opportunities. In most cases, we are dealing with a dynamic, rather than a static, issue—changing situations somewhat similar to a highway roundabout, where cars are entering into and exiting from a circular roadway. We’ve all experienced the frustration of being behind someone who doesn’t respond to an opening in the traffic pattern and remains stuck in place. They are too safekeeping, or security-minded, or fearful that they can’t maneuver their car quickly enough to fill in <a id="page_327"></a>an open space in the traffic. Seizing upon a chance in a potentially creative situation is analogous. We have to take a calculated risk in order to take advantage of an opening that will allow us to move forward toward a creative solution. The consequences of not seizing a chance are that we are stuck in our own mental traffic jam and there is no creative outcome or business benefit.</p>

<p class="noindent">It may be helpful to gain a new perspective on a problem by viewing it from a different mode of thinking.</p>
<p class="indent">Using the worksheet template in <a class="nounder" href="ch22.html#ch22fig3">Figure 22-3</a>, on a piece of paper, ask yourself how this problem would appear to a person viewing it from the A, B, C, or D-quadrants.

<h4 class="h4a">Bridging the Gap Between the Different Thinking Tribes for Great Creativity</h4>
<p class="noindent">Given the generally left-mode, A/B-oriented preferences of the business community, it’s not surprising that there is some skepticism about creativity and the creative process from the perspective of bottom-line, traditional, rational thinking. For some businesspeople, a more creative approach can take on the <a id="page_328"></a>image of crazy tangents, impractical ideas, and generally weird behavior. But there are rational explanations for this seemingly “odd” behavior, and it is important for organizations to understand this so that it can be considered acceptable and thus be legitimatized.</p>

<p class="numberlist2">1. What business calls thinking is different from what a more creative community calls thinking. The different preferences of the creative community engage parts of the mental process that are more expansive, free-flowing, aesthetic, experimental, and risk-oriented—not the usual processes for most business communities.</p>
<p class="numberlist2">2. Members of a more creative community are stimulated by different kinds of work. They have different values and different priorities. They like to have a variety of stimuli, and thus they may get frustrated or even bored by the more structured, nuts-and-bolts work activities that many traditional businesspeople find stimulating.</p>
<p class="numberlist2b">3. The classic business community is smart in one way, and the more creative community is smart in other ways. And while these different kinds of smartness should be complementary, they are often misunderstood and end up being mutually antagonistic.</p>
<p class="indent">This combination of thinking preferences, types of smartness, differing values, and differing priorities contributes to what is, in many businesses, an arm’s-length relationship between those who are more interested in viable, yet more traditional business approaches and those who are looking for new, more innovative, and more creative approaches. As a result, it often turns into a situation of “us” and “them.” The sad part is that it doesn’t have to be. The loss of potential synergy is enormous and costly.</p>
<p class="indent">How do you bridge the divide between those who like to spend all day batting around ideas and relying on their “hunches” and those who prefer a clear, step-by-step process and structure? The first step is to give them an understanding of how they each think (for example, using a tool like the HBDI) so that people can learn about their own preferences with a focus on <em>application in terms of solving real business challenges</em>—not just a “feel-good” exercise. Then bring them together to understand their <em>thinking</em> <a id="page_329"></a>differences, identify the value in them, and learn how they can complement each other and add value to the business. Provide them with tools that they can use to leverage those differences, and let them get to work on a real challenge. Once they see that the results they get together will almost always outperform those that they get separately, it becomes a very different conversation, and a very different culture.</p>
<p class="indent">There is often common ground that you can build on. Our colleague Chuck McVinney<sup><a id="ch22end4a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch22end4">4</a></sup> shared a great example of results that came from “bridging the gap” in a midsized company that had a problem between two major teams, one that was more C/D-oriented—they were designers and purchasers of innovative products—and the finance and administrative team, whose role included keeping people compliant with budgets. Neither team really “got” the other, and the result was a meager 30 percent compliance with the planned budget and procedures.</p>
<p class="indent">When their HBDI Team Profiles were analyzed, Chuck noted that both teams had one element in common in spite of their differences: they both scored high on teaching and training. We know from our research that different thinking preferences lead to different teaching and learning preferences (see <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</a>). So in a program set up to address the compliance problem, the finance team was asked, “What do you mean by teaching?” The team members replied that they taught employees about their systems and procedures, how to be compliant, how to fill out the forms, and similar activities. Those on the design team were then asked how they preferred to learn. Their answers included activities like discovery and dialogue—certainly not the “information download” that the finance team was doing, in effect telling them what to do.</p>
<p class="indent">The result was that those on the design team felt as though the finance team was like a police force, wanting to control everything. Once the members of the finance team understood this, they redefined the way they taught compliance, involving the members of the design team as contributors to the education process. Compliance went up to 80 percent almost immediately.</p>
<p class="indent">How do you define the thinking culture of your company in terms of the Whole Brain quadrants? How many people are using old processes to fix new problems? How do your hiring, development processes, performance measures, and leadership approaches impede or support creative thinking? Here is the good news: the late W. Edwards Deming wrote that 94 percent of quality issues were caused by the system—and not the workers.<sup><a id="ch22end5a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch22end5">5</a></sup> This is a prime opportunity for improvement that anyone in the organization can directly affect.</p>
<p class="title"><a id="page_330"></a><strong>SO WHAT?</strong></p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Without a climate and a culture that support creative thinking, organizations will miss out on their full creative potential and the resulting business benefits.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Whole Brain teams made up of creative process champions who are experts in a particular creative process can be assigned to solve major problems by applying multiple processes to the solution.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  There is a universe of creative processes that can be used as a resource to help teams leverage their breadth of thinking.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  To move from incremental to truly breakthrough solutions, we have to build in strategies for overcoming the natural resistance between the different mental tribes in the organization—only then can the resulting synergies emerge.</p>
