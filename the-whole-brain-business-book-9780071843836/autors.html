<p class="noindent">Ann Herrmann-Nehdi is CEO of Herrmann International.

<p class="indent">Herrmann-Nehdi has worked with many hundreds of organizations of all sizes and industries around the world, helping them leverage their cognitive diversity and increase their thinking agility to improve profitability, leadership, productivity, innovation, and overall business results.</p>
<p class="indent">A thought leader in her field, she has been featured in media outlets such as <em>Business News Daily, Chief Executive Magazine</em>, <em>Chief Learning Officer Magazine</em>, <em>HR Executive Magazine, Investor’s Business Daily</em>, <em>Management Today, T</em>+<em>D Magazine, Training Journal</em>, and <em>O The Oprah Magazine</em>, and has contributed chapters to many books on the topic of Whole Brain Thinking and Learning.

Through Herrmann International’s global offices and the thousands of HBDI® practitioners around the world, millions of individuals and their teams—including nine out of ten of the Fortune 100 and prominent universities such as Stanford, MIT, Vanderbilt, and INSEAD—have applied the Whole Brain system to improve performance.</p>
<h3 class="h3ba">Ned Herrmann</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ned Herrmann, who founded Herrmann International in 1981 and was the originator of Whole Brain Thinking, first pioneered the study of the brain in the field of business while working as manager of General Electric Corporation’s Management Education at Crotonville.</p>
<p class="indent">Herrmann’s work has been featured in the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, <em>Business Week</em>, <em>Scientific American</em>, <em>Discover</em>, <em>USA Today</em>, <em>Training</em>, and <em>Reader’s Digest</em>, among many other national and international publications.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_414"></a>In 1988 he published his widely acclaimed book, <em>The Creative Brain</em>, tracing the scientific and historical roots of his innovative Whole Brain Thinking approach. In 1995 McGraw-Hill published the first edition of <em>The Whole Brain Business Book,</em> creating a new benchmark in the arena of mind research and its applications to business.</p>
<p class="indent">Herrmann viewed the Whole Brain Model as a metaphor for an organizing principle of how the brain works, and as clients and practitioners around the world demonstrate every day, the exponential applications of one simple model have created a system that can improve virtually all aspects of personal and work performance.</p>
