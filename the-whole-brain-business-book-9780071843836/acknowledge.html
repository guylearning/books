<p class="para"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen we decided to update this book, we faced an interesting challenge: how to update and reorganize the book to better reflect today’s realities and examples while not losing my father’s voice and the “soul” of the original book.</p>
<p class="indent">I knew we needed a great team to make this happen. I was very fortunate to have the support and creative skills that Marla Lepore provided. Marla’s patience, deep knowledge, and fantastic editing skills were essential to the success of the project, and I will be forever thankful to her.</p>
<p class="indent">Linda Plante played a significant role, helping the entire team stay on track so that we could meet deadlines and collaborate effectively. We could not have done this without her!</p>
<p class="indent">Tracy Sterling brought her great project management expertise to the project, which, combined with her knowledge and extensive experience in Whole Brain Thinking, helped ensure that we delivered a high-quality product with up-to-date, practical, and relevant application content.</p>
<p class="indent">I am deeply appreciative of Mohamed Ali Nehdi’s graphic design capability, deep knowledge, and experience from working on the first edition of the book. Without it, we could not have provided all the new and updated graphics and data displays. In addition, as my partner in this work and as my husband, he has contributed to our work in Whole Brain Thinking in more ways than I can possibly list. Thank you!</p>
<p class="indent">Daniel Stanhope provided important psychometric analysis and concepts for our HBDI data updates, especially the CEO data, which were critical to this project and which I greatly appreciate.</p>
<p class="indent">Laura Lovallo Wang and Dale McGowan, along with our manuscript reviewers, Michael Packard and Daryl Hammett, helped to provide invaluable assistance in the final stages of production. Lori Addicks and Michael Morgan contributed stories and examples in addition to serving as manuscript reviewers.</p>
<p class="indent">My personal thanks go to all those who contributed updated stories and examples: David Clancy, Ted Coulson, Ann-Louise deBoer, Rich DeSerio, Prasad Deshpande, Manny Elkind, Ayn Fox, Paul Gustavson, Bill Hart, Jay Kayne, Fred Keeton, Lynne Krause, Ed and Monika Lumsdaine, Lewis Lubin, Anne McGee-Cooper, Bob McKown, Tiffany McMacken, Chuck McVinney, <a id="page_xiv"></a>Colin Pidd, Cynthia Radford, Lynn Robinson, Crystal Snoddy, Allison Strickland, Duane Trammell, Chris Webb, and Robert Webber.</p>
<p class="indent">Many thanks to Randy Glasbergen for the terrific humor he brings through the cartoons we have included.</p>
<p class="indent">Special thanks go to my son, Karim Nehdi, who, as a third-generation leader at Herrmann International, is taking the work to new heights by bringing important new insights and values that also influenced many of the updates we created for this book.</p>
<p class="indent">I cannot thank enough my mother, Margy Herrmann, to whom the first edition was dedicated, for all of her significant contribution to this body of work over many decades, which continues today; my sister, Pat, for her terrific proofreading and review of the book; and my sister, Laura, and son, Selim, for their continued love and support.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, my personal thanks to the Herrmann International team and all the HBDI certified practitioners around the globe who continue to provide us with new applications of the concept and are every day helping individuals, teams, and organization drive better results through Whole Brain Thinking.</p>
