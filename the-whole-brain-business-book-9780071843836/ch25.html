<p class="para"><strong><span class="dropcap">A</span></strong> colleague, Russell Means, started a very successful legal practice by involving retired lawyers in the Florida city where he set up his first practice. As a young person who had never set up a business, he found an enormous pool of successful people who were energetic, smart, and available. Russell was able to take advantage of several hundred years of accumulated experience in launching his legal practice. The level of competence that these highly experienced people provided was beyond his ability to pay for, but because of their circumstances and his need, he got a dollar’s worth of ability for ten cents.</p>
<p class="indent">No matter how you do it, if you want to start a business, you need to know your own strengths and limitations and find ways to fill in the business gaps so that you don’t become another statistic in the annual report of business failures. At a bare minimum, most entrepreneurs should line up a CPA and a lawyer whom they trust, and pledge to listen to them. Trust your instincts, but take their advice. Every step along the way, seek out the expertise you need to complement your own.</p>
<p class="indent">Many people aspire to go out on their own, and in today’s environment, a move to become an entrepreneur may be the most desirable or only option. But it’s one thing to know that you want to “make the leap”; it’s something <a id="page_362"></a>else entirely to know whether you have what it takes. Understanding your preferences and using a Whole Brain approach will significantly improve your chances of success. It will also help you understand the entrepreneurial mindset—a key factor for making any start-up or brand-new initiative successful.</p>

<p class="att"><strong>—Robert L. Schwartz</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Beyond the typical application involving a new business venture, entrepreneurial thinking is also at the heart of many corporate initiatives that champion an innovative mindset and seek to emulate the creative and boundary-breaking energy that many start-ups produce. Because of the nature of the work, these kinds of projects require people to behave like “intrapreneurs,” all within a corporate culture that may or may not be ready for or open to it.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether you are considering an intrapreneurial approach or going out on your own, looking at what we know about entrepreneurs can help you better understand entrepreneurial thinking and what it might mean for you.</p>
<h4 class="h4">How Do Your Thinking Preferences Compare to the Average Entrepreneur’s?</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ve got this terrific idea. You think it will work, but you need some reassurance that you are on the right track and an affirmation that you’ve got what it takes. There are numerous experts who can help you get your act together—financial experts, business process experts, and motivational psychologists, not to mention friends, neighbors, and family. Many of them have written books on the subject or offer workshops or webinars and often include motivational phrases such as “go for it.” What I have to offer is not in competition with any of these sources, but it is one of the first things that you should explore.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe it is essential for someone who is contemplating starting a business or who is, in essence, being asked to become an intrapreneur inside a business to know what his or her thinking preferences are and the potential influence of those preferences on the person’s entrepreneurial business behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">A strong D-quadrant primary preference—a high average score (92)—is characteristic of all entrepreneurs in our global database (both technical and nontechnical, male and female). <em>Nontechnical</em> male entrepreneurs also have a primary preference in the A quadrant (70). In contrast, the female norm for nontechnical entrepreneurs is slightly more balanced, but with an even <a id="page_363"></a>stronger D quadrant (97) combined with a C-quadrant primary preference. Not surprisingly, <em>technical</em> entrepreneurs (both male and female) have higher A-quadrant scores, but still maintain that very strong D-quadrant score, which clearly defines the entrepreneurial mindset. A study conducted by Huefner, Hunt, and Robinson, looking at a comparison of four scales predicting entrepreneurship, confirmed the consistency of a high D-quadrant preference for entrepreneurs.<sup><a id="ch25end1a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch25end1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Look more closely at the HBDI data, and you’ll discover that the work elements ranking for all entrepreneurs reinforces their unique profile, showing the top six most-preferred to be, in descending order, problem solving, expressing ideas, innovating, conceptualizing, interpersonal, and creative. This is distinctly different from the managerial data discussed in <a class="nounder" href="ch20.html#ch20">Chapter 20</a>, where innovating and creative appear <em>in the bottom five.</em> Even for CEOs, innovating is lower, landing in the fifth spot, and creative is even lower, at ninth. This highlights the difference between entrepreneurs, who have a consistently high average preference in the D quadrant, and other key leaders.</p>
<p class="indent">So if you’re an entrepreneur with the typical profile, the high average D-quadrant preference, combined with the work element preferences for innovating, conceptualizing, and creative, implies that you have ideas, concepts, and a vision of the future. You are also better suited to deal with risk and ambiguity, and probably are pretty optimistic about your chances for success (see <a class="nounder" href="ch25.html#ch25fig1">Figure 25-1</a>). These characteristics are what fuel an entrepreneur’s energy, drive, and strong focus on the vision and the dream, often sustaining him or her when the going gets tough and the inevitable challenges arise in the start-up process. From a business perspective, however, the dark side of the entrepreneur’s profile implies that he or she has (1) only a moderate level of interest and probable capability in the rational, analytic, and financial domain; (2) perhaps some knowledge of but not much energy for or even skill in business planning and details; and (3) limited perspective in recognizing that certain other people may have to be involved in the venture. At the extreme, a typical entrepreneurial mentality is often: “Legal advice costs money I don’t have, and since this is a low-risk venture, I don’t believe I’ll need a lawyer <em>or</em> a financial expert <em>or</em> a business planner <em>or</em> a human resource mentor.”</p>

<p class="figcap1"><strong><small>FIGURE 25-1</small></strong> Composite profile averages of male and female non-technical entrepreneurs. Male non-technical: 1-2-2-1+ (70-66-67-91). Female non-technical: 2-2-1-1+ (53-65-85-97).</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">You’re going to fail, probably many times. But that’s okay—in fact, it’s essential. Very often, the diff erence between success and failure is simply perseverance.<sup><a id="ch25end2a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch25end2">2</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_364"></a>Our research and the study of successful entrepreneurs shows that you <em>do</em> need to supplement your strong preferred modes with additional interests and needed competencies—never forgetting the critical importance of those areas that may not be in your sweet spot, like legal or financial advice if you have a typical entrepreneurial profile.</p>
<p class="indent">If, on the other hand, you do not have a strong preference for the visionary, risk-oriented D quadrant, other challenges are likely to emerge.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose your HBDI Profile is more oriented toward the B quadrant and its safekeeping thinking preferences (2-1-2-2)—the opposite of an entrepreneur’s typical profile (see <a class="nounder" href="ch25.html#ch25fig2">Figure 25-2</a>). Case in point: Sarah had been persuaded by others that her idea was too good to pass up, so she went for it. But her preferences put up challenges. Along with her traditional and conservative approach to life, she was very focused on safety, security, and details to the point of wanting to have everything perfectly lined up and predictable. As a result, she wasn’t able to have the big-picture view, a long-range vision that could serve as her guiding star. She struggled at every step along the path, and because she was so concerned about control and possible risk, her health started to suffer.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch25fig2"></a><img src="f0365-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="383" height="439"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 25-2</small></strong> An atypical HBDI profile for an entrepreneur: The 2-1-2-2 profile.</p>
<p class="indent">Sarah did not realize or see with clear objectivity that she would be “riding the brake” throughout her business’s birth and infancy stages, creating enormous delay and frustration along the way. Ideally, Sarah needed to partner with an complementary thinker, an entrepreneur whose vision, enthusiasm, and risk orientation could carry her through the first few years of her business journey, but she ended up so frustrated and out of energy from trying to get everything “just right” prior to launch that she ended up dropping the project altogether.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_365"></a>Roxie, on the other hand, has a strong preference for the interpersonal C quadrant (2-2-1-2) (see <a class="nounder" href="ch25.html#ch25fig3">Figure 25-3</a>) and enthusiastically wanted to start her own consulting business. Roxie <em>loves</em> people, and her profile confirmed what she already knew: she really didn’t know much about business, she’d never been good at organizing and planning, and her new business idea was much more of an urge than a concept—she had kind of “felt” that the business could be a real success. Roxie was an HBDI practitioner who had a very strong intuition that she could make a go of it, but she also recognized from her knowledge of Whole Brain Thinking that when she compared her profile to that of the occupational norm for an entrepreneur, there were significant differences. She knew that it would be risky for her to attempt to launch her business given her nonbusiness mentality, so she joined forces with a group of other consultants in her area, and as a result, they all benefited from the greater breadth of thinking and the support system that they needed to be successful.</p>

<p class="indent">Bryson, with a strong A-quadrant, technical-oriented preference (1-2-2-2), knew that he had a tiger by the tail (see <a class="nounder" href="ch25.html#ch25fig4">Figure 25-4</a>). A technical whiz, he had a business idea that was surely a winner. The logic of it was overwhelming. Bryson had analyzed the need and diagnosed the market potential, and he had a good handle on the needed finances. What he lacked was a solid business plan and a timeline for the new product’s development. Missing the big-picture <a id="page_366"></a><a id="page_367"></a>concept of where his proposed business could really go, Bryson’s view had been extremely narrow, with essentially a tunnel-vision focus on just trying to get this thing built. But the weakest link in his business experience had to do with people: he simply wasn’t interested in this critical aspect, and he felt it every time he needed to make a pitch or try to sell someone on the idea—people just weren’t as interested in all the technical aspects as he was! Bryson ultimately got involved with the local start-up community, where he was able to build a team and get good advice on how best to get his product off the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">All of these aspiring businesspeople went for it, in spite of the predictable consequences of their particular coalition of mental preferences. The quest to have their own business was so strong that it overrode many of the inadequacies they might have felt along the way.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the statistics on business failures are so frightening, I believe that people who want to start their own business need to be absolutely objective about their own mental capability to undertake such a risk. So the first order of business is to understand themselves. The second order of business is to supplement their areas of low preference—which most frequently represent their lowest levels of established competence—by aligning with or bringing in people to provide those competencies. I’ve said it since <a class="nounder" href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>: every business runs on thinking, and I’m convinced that starting and running a successful business is a Whole Brain activity. As my colleague Michael Morgan of Herrmann International Australia likes to say: “You can be in any business you like, but successful business requires Whole Brain Thinking.” All four of the examples here needed to supplement their single-quadrant primary preferences with the other three.</p>

<p class="indent">Imagine for a moment a four-person volleyball team in which only one of the players is really skilled in the game, while the other three are generally familiar with volleyball, but have played it only once or twice. This is an analogy or metaphor for the four selves (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>) <a id="page_368"></a>that make up our mental capabilities. The business world requires four skilled players on each team. Without all four, not only are the chances of winning greatly decreased, but even staying in the game becomes a critical question.</p>
<p class="indent">You can supplement the three less-skilled players on your “team” in many ways. If your financial assets allow, you can hire them. One or two could be family members, or you can get the needed input from established contacts, such as bankers and lawyers. But there is another possible source. Remember Russell Means? Russell was successful because he understood his strengths and potential blind spots and planned around them, creatively using retired resources. What is most important is finding that breadth of thinking, no matter how and where you do it.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Thinking like an Entrepreneur</h4>
<p class="noindent">The unique nature of entrepreneurial thinking has been consistent over the last several decades. It is interesting to compare the current HBDI data analysis showing a very strong preference for D-quadrant thinking (2-2-2-1+) with the data from a study I conducted more than 30 years ago of 70 entrepreneurs who had attended the School for Entrepreneurs at the Tarrytown House and were participating in a reunion led by its founder, Bob Schwartz<sup><a id="ch25end3a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch25end3">3</a></sup> the consistency of high D-quadrant preference among entrepreneurs is astounding. It is seldom that an occupational group has such a clearly defined norm. In my initial study, what struck me most was that all the profiles were within five or ten points of each of the quadrant scores making up the average. In interviews with these people, I discovered that almost all of them were currently successful, but that they <em>had failed at least once during their entrepreneurial career.</em></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Entrepreneurship is business behavior resulting from a specialized form of thinking greatly influenced by an individual’s D-quadrant mental preferences.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Ned Herrmann</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Could aspiring entrepreneurs who have their strongest primaries in the A, B, or C quadrants succeed in an entrepreneurial venture? Based on all of our entrepreneurial research to date, I would have to say that these people would not be the best choice, as they would need to stretch far beyond their natural preferences in order to undertake a true entrepreneurial venture. This is not to say that someone with such a profile, especially if it is combined with a low D-quadrant score, could not make it, but it is clear to me that to succeed in a <em>true entrepreneurial situation</em> dealing with high-risk new products and unknown markets, it takes a very strong D-quadrant thinking preference <a id="page_369"></a>to achieve the level of success that is fundamental to entrepreneurial behavior. For those who don’t naturally think that way, they must have a very strong motivation and drive to “up the D-quadrant game,” something that is often accomplished by partnering with another entrepreneur and/or hiring one early in order to be truly entrepreneurial. Other alternatives might include joining an existing small business, owning a franchise, or scaling back the risks with a less ambitious business plan.</p>
<p class="indent">This explains what is often referred to as the “entrepreneurial bug.” Entrepreneurs are interested in the adventure, in the pursuit, in the chase of a business venture that has never actually been launched in this unique way. It is not just the thrill of the investment risk; it is the need for the spirited chase of the personal dream. For these reasons, the strong, overriding D-quadrant mentality is almost essential to playing the role to the hilt (see <a class="nounder" href="ch25.html#ch25fig5">Figure 25-5</a>). No other strong quadrant preference provides the needed ingredients for entrepreneurial behavior.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_370"></a>Of course, there are significant consequences to unleashing that behavior based upon a very strong, often single primary preference in the D quadrant. It would be typical of this mentality to want to continue “to entrepreneur,” even though it was time to change gears and focus on building and delivering the product. This is frequently a fatal consequence of D-quadrant thinking that is not appropriately moderated by contributions from the A, B, and C quadrants. Entrepreneurs need to be smart enough to be aware of their own obsession and also to seek out objective advice and counsel regarding their stewardship of the entrepreneurial enterprise.</p>
<p class="indent">International management consultant Ichak Adizes describes the life cycles of a business from its “infancy” to its achieving of “prime.”<sup><a id="ch25end4a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch25end4">4</a></sup> As discussed in <a class="nounder" href="ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a>, during these growth stages, through infancy and adolescence, entrepreneurial thinking is almost always the key mentality required for success, but as the business matures and begins to enter a state of optimization and stability, the leadership style must change and the “obsessive” entrepreneurial behavior must stop, or the business will suffer and ultimately fail.</p>
<p class="indent">Most entrepreneurs are capable of shifting their mental processes if they become alert to the need to do so. The HBDI includes strong primaries (1), secondaries (2), and even low tertiaries (3). (For more information, refer to Appendix A in the back of the book.) Once they understand that their HBDI Profile also includes secondary preferences, they can shift by intentionally and <em>situationally</em> engaging those secondary preferences (and the resulting competencies) as the need for their primary entrepreneurial focus declines in the business. This requires a wake-up call of reality from their team, advisors, or consultants to effect the midcourse correction that they need to make in order to survive infancy and adolescence and achieve mature success. Even then, such a shift takes tremendous energy and focus for most entrepreneurs.</p>

<p class="indentb">Engaging that team of diverse thinkers is critical. Here’s one of the ways our colleague Joseph Kayne, former director of the Miami University Institute for Entrepreneurship and current CEO of the Imagine It Project, would highlight the importance to his students:<sup><a id="ch25end5a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch25end5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindentl">At Miami University we used the HBDI to reinforce the value of diverse thinking preferences in an entrepreneurial venture. One exercise which drove this point home was class discussion around the question, “What <a id="page_371"></a>would a new business look like if the entire senior management had a blue preference? Green preference? And so on.” Regardless of the quadrant preference, students quickly realized a single-preference management team would be highly dysfunctional.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In working with an entrepreneur who was so obsessed with his dream that he couldn’t see it <em>not happen</em>, I found that the most effective way to demonstrate what was missing—and needed—for success was to help him understand how, without good counsel, financial issues could prevent him from achieving “the dream.” We then arranged for a CPA he trusted to conduct a financial audit and share the results with all the key players in the enterprise. After reviewing the audit results, he developed a revised entrepreneurial statement of business objectives and passed it to all key personnel for their annotated comments. Next, working with the CPA, I helped the entrepreneur diagnose the audit results and the statement of business objectives using the four-quadrant model, testing for viability in each quadrant. With the help of the CPA and the team, we came to terms with each of the nonviable <a id="page_372"></a>aspects of the business and then prepared a newly revised statement of business objectives that all concerned considered financially viable. This felt like a painful process at the time, but it provided an essential reality check that ultimately saved the business. It struck me at the time how little preparation most entrepreneurs really have as they embark on their journey.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, some years later, I was invited to attend Cornell University’s Entrepreneurship and Personal Enterprise Celebration honoring M. Arthur Gensler as Cornell’s Entrepreneur of the Year. I was surprised and pleased to discover that Cornell University had launched, with strong support from a group of inspired, entrepreneurially oriented alumni, a university-wide Entrepreneurship and Personal Enterprise (EPE) program. I was also intrigued to see a relatively large number of students from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, the Cornell Hotel School, and the Johnson Graduate School of Management in attendance, demonstrating that entrepreneurship can exist across many disciplines. The focus on entrepreneurship at Cornell continues today through Entrepreneurship at Cornell (ECA) and a wide range of programs and initiatives across all the colleges at Cornell.</p>
<p class="indent">The heart and soul of EPE depended on its advisory council of Cornell graduates, all of whom have a successful track record as entrepreneurs. They served as visiting faculty members and contributors to events like the one I participated in and had a direct interface with the students, who came from many colleges and schools throughout the university. It’s an approach that is widely used in other programs today.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">This integration of the active input from successful entrepreneurs with the academic aspects of entrepreneurial management and the essential business skills for successful personal enterprise into one multidiscipline program is, I believe, key to their success. Many schools have MBA programs and business courses, but until recently, it was rare to find schools that offered both undergraduate and graduate entrepreneurship programs like Cornell, Miami University in Ohio, Belmont University in Nashville, the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis, Babson University in Boston, and the many, many others that now exist. Today, owing perhaps in part to the economy and in part to the changing interests and motivations of the new generations entering the workforce, entrepreneurship is one of the fastest-growing majors in the United States. In addition, “start-up institutes” and business incubators are popping up in cities across the world with the purpose of educating entrepreneurs and helping them establish and grow their businesses. What a break for the <a id="page_373"></a>aspiring entrepreneur! I would love to go back to school and acquire the skills that I missed completely and had to learn the hard way. These programs make a real contribution to business education, and the HBDI is built into a number of them as a core component of the self-understanding required to navigate the entrepreneurial journey effectively.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Do You Really Want to Own a Business, or Are You Looking for Intrapreneurship?</h4>
<p class="noindent">For many people, the idea of being an entrepreneur often turns out to be more appealing than the reality of it. The term <em>entrepreneur</em> conjures up the image of an independent person with a unique product or service idea that is developed and brought to market by the wits, skill, energy, and risk taking of that highly motivated person. Many such businesses fail, although some, like Lazarus, rise from the ashes of defeat and ultimately succeed. In the Tarrytown School entrepreneur study, I learned that most of that group, even though they were now successful, had experienced failure one or more times. This is a typical trait of entrepreneurs and implies a level of motivation to succeed that overrides trouble along the way and is often so strong that it could be described as an obsession. They have caught the “entrepreneurial bug” and usually will not be satisfied until the business idea has been fully explored. The typical entrepreneur is almost always working outside of any formal company organization, unless it’s a company that he or she personally owns. If that’s the case, the entrepreneur has freedom of action that doesn’t exist inside an organization—freedom to take risks without justifying them and to fail without the usual organizational consequences. But what about those who wish to be or need to be entrepreneurial inside an organization? Today, “entrepreneurial thinking” is showing up more frequently on desired leadership competency lists. In just one example, a large, global multinational’s competency list recently specified, “Lead with an entrepreneurial mindset.”</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">If you want to be an entrepreneur, it’s not a job, it’s a lifestyle. It defines you.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Niklas Zennstrom</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The word <em>intrapreneur</em> was coined by Gifford Pinchot III,<sup><a id="ch25end6a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch25end6">6</a></sup> who was associated at the time with Robert Schwartz at the Tarrytown School for Entrepreneurs. By <em>intrapreneur</em>, Pinchot meant an individual who was functioning in an entrepreneurial way <em>within</em> an organization. The concept is great, but the intrapreneur’s circumstances are very different because, unlike the entrepreneur, the intrapreneur is tied to an organization that has a climate, culture, leadership, policies, budgets, audit procedures, <em>and</em> supervising <a id="page_374"></a>management. In every sense, it almost always reeks of political complexity and fear of risk, and it often has a bureaucracy. Catching the entrepreneurial bug and going it alone is not often possible under these conditions. In most cases, the reality is that others who have managerial decision-making authority are also involved in the intrapreneurial project. The true classic entrepreneur would never buy into this situation. The conditions are too limiting for freedom of action, and freedom of action is a requirement for entrepreneurialism.</p>
<p class="indent">If the organization wants to develop a climate that supports risk taking and freedom of action, then the process might work. However, my experience tells me that in order for the intrapreneur to be able to function in an entrepreneurial manner, his or her mentality and that of the sponsor need to be in very good alignment. My personal belief is that it takes a high-level champion who thinks like an entrepreneur to create intrapreneurial protective “air cover.” We don’t have a thinking preferences norm for intrapreneurs because this is not an occupational title. If it were, I have reason to believe that the norm for intrapreneurs would be generally similar to the profile for entrepreneurs, so the opportunity for organizations is to find these thinkers and provide them with the air cover they need if they are to survive.</p>
<p class="indent">However, I <em>do</em> see a catch-22. Most entrepreneurs don’t want to have anything to do with constraining structures or bureaucracies. They don’t want to have anything to do with people looking over their shoulder. They don’t want to have anything to do with externally imposed financial constraints. In general, they don’t want to have anything to do with rules, procedures, policies, audits, and strict reporting relationships.</p>
<p class="indent">Years ago, I talked to Gifford Pinchot at length about his concept of intrapreneurship and argued the points that I’ve just made. His idea is very appealing, of course, and under the right circumstances, it can be applied successfully. And when it succeeds, it is wonderful. Resources do exist. The League of Intrapreneurs<sup><a id="ch25end7a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch25end7">7</a></sup> is one example, providing tips, support mechanisms, and ideas for intrapreneurs.</p>

<p class="indent">Under the right circumstances, it is possible to have successful intrapreneurs. I was an intrapreneur within GE for five years before I left the company and became an entrepreneur. Much of what I have described in this book, including the Whole Brain concept, the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument, and their application to teaching, learning, creativity, and innovation were all developed while I was an employee of General Electric. <a id="page_375"></a>During the high-risk developmental phase of this technology, I was given the necessary air cover by my direct boss, Lindon Saline, and his financial manager, Dave Dickson, and also by the senior vice president and the CEO. However, there were several high-level managers, including another senior vice president, who felt that what I was doing was not in any way aligned with General Electric’s business operations and was therefore inappropriate. Because of the air cover my champions provided me, along with my own wits and ingenuity and the quality of my ideas, I not only survived but succeeded. In a win-win arrangement, I partnered with GE through the infancy stage of my entrepreneurial endeavors and the starting of my own company, with GE sending participants to my creativity workshops, a process that benefited the organization’s ongoing efforts to build creative problem-solving skills. GE also used me as a consultant in the area of cognitive diversity as I made the transition out of my role.</p>
<p class="indent">While I love the idea of intrapreneurship, there are potentially severe personal consequences from playing that role or serving as a champion for others. It takes good ideas, high motivation, guts, and a thick skin—a true entrepreneurial spirit. A golden parachute also helps!</p>
<h4 class="h4">Building Entrepreneurial Thinking as a Core Competency</h4>
<p class="noindent">For organizations that truly wish to encourage entrepreneurial thinking, the challenge is no less daunting. First, they need to make sure that they understand what entrepreneurial thinking actually entails and not just pay lip service to it. Creating a clear definition is the first step. Next, it is crucial that they focus on the outcomes they hope it will produce: new product ideas, additional opportunities with customers, internal process improvement ideas, and so on. Then it is vital that they put in place the necessary thinking skills—through training and development as well as through project work that allows those skills to be applied. Many companies try hiring people who bring an entrepreneurial mindset with them, but the risk is that if the company lacks the requisite climate, those hires will leave in frustration. Another approach is to seek out those employees who may be natural entrepreneurs but are using those skills outside of the organization and provide them with the air cover they need to bring their ideas inside.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, and most important, doing a full audit of what is really required in terms of climate and leadership to support those efforts is essential! Entrepreneurial thinking is available—but be careful what you ask for! Once it is unleashed, it has terrific power.</p>
<p class="title"><a id="page_376"></a><strong>SO WHAT?</strong></p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  People who start businesses need to know their own strengths and weaknesses first so that they can then seek out complementary skills in internal or external advisors.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Many entrepreneurs share a common profile, with a strong preference for D-quadrant-oriented, visionary, risk-driven thinking.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  The dark side of that profile is that the other three quadrants of needed business interests and competencies are usually inadequate or missing.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Business is a Whole Brain activity. Therefore, the chance of start-up success increases when interest and competency in all four quadrants are available in the leadership role.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Those who are interested in being internal entrepreneurs, or intrapreneurs, can succeed, but they require air cover by a senior champion and a very strong motivation to successfully navigate the cultural roadblocks they are likely to encounter along the way.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Organizations that seek to build entrepreneurial thinking as a core competency should make a commitment to build the climate and leadership willingness to support it, or it will not succeed.</p>
