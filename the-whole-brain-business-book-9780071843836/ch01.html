<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Because every business runs on its thinking, optimizing thinking is the key to better performance and better results.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  The more we learn about the brain, the more relevant these concepts are to every aspect of your business, your own career, and your professional growth.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  With Whole Brain® Thinking, your business will have an improvement process that does for people and the organization what Lean did for manufacturing and Agile did for technology.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  More than 30 years of research stand behind the concepts, examples, and stories you will be reading about in this book.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="dropcap">M</span>y first full-scale research activities on brain function caused quite a stir at the GE Management Development Institute at Crotonville in the mid-1970s. Ironically, most people couldn’t see how the brain was connected with my professional work in management education. Compared to what we now know about the brain, we were pretty much in the Dark Ages. In addition, most business cultures were so steeped in analytical, logical, and safekeeping modes of thinking that they not only resisted the idea of “Whole Brain” Thinking, but also didn’t see why they needed to recognize, acknowledge, and apply the more interpersonal, imaginative styles of thinking that existed within their organizations but were often buried.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether it was explicitly articulated or not, the typical response that I seemed to be getting back then was some variation of a basic question: <a id="page_8"></a>“So what?” So it’s probably fitting that each chapter in this book ends with a section entitled “So What?” Why does it matter that we have different preferences for different kinds of thinking? What does creative thinking have to do with business success? Why should I care about this when I need to make my numbers, deal with complex issues, rally people around a new mission and strategy, and keep people engaged and performing at their peak?</p>

<p class="att"><strong>—F. W. Nichol</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">When it comes to running a business, <em>so what</em>?</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>What Is Whole Brain Thinking?</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Applying Whole Brain Thinking means being able to fully leverage one’s own preferences, stretch to other styles when necessary, and adapt to and take advantage of the preferences of those around you to improve performance and results.</p>
</div>
<p class="indentbt">The answer is simple: every business runs on thinking. If you want to continually improve and reach new heights in an increasingly complex world, you have to understand the impact of thinking and take advantage of all the thinking potential that you have. For my own company and for all businesses, a more conscious Whole Brain approach to business is a necessity, not an option, for these primary reasons:</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>If thinking is the fuel that drives business, we need to understand how the brain works in order to deal with change effectively.</strong> Are you dealing with the same kinds of problems, opportunities, and work environment that you faced five years ago? Or even a year ago? Change is happening so fast that it’s not uncommon for most businesspeople to be coming up against challenges and issues that have no precedent on an almost daily basis.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>This level of change requires you to fully leverage all the mental muscle you have in order to move away from resistance and seek out new thinking.</strong> When you can engage the kind of specialized thinking that is more inclined to embrace novelty, you’ll be better able to make critical decisions after the facts have run out. To compete effectively in a world characterized by change, everyone has to be able to function using all of the brain’s different modes. This has never been truer than it is today.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><a id="page_9"></a><strong>Mentally diverse heterogeneous groups produce more creative, effective solutions than do similar-thinking homogeneous groups.</strong> This isn’t an altogether new thought. The saying “two heads are better than one” has been around for a while. We just didn’t have research to explain it or a way to measure it, manage it, and describe it, which is what the Whole Brain Thinking concept allows. We now have the research that demonstrates why we need all the diverse thinking in our organizations working together if we are to get the best results, particularly as the challenges we face keep getting more complex. The good news is that most organizations have those cognitive differences within their ranks; they just have to know where to seek them out and how best to leverage the diversity.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>With greater thinking diversity comes a unique challenge: heterogeneous groups are often much harder to manage.</strong> Classic management approaches no longer apply—they’re too constricting, and therefore they’re usually counterproductive. To manage these diverse groups, leaders need to be more like translators than like traditional taskmasters. The upshot: if we’re going to tap the power of the Whole Brain team, we have to learn Whole Brain ways of managing.</p>
<p class="noindentlb"><strong>Certain modes of thinking will increasingly dominate an organization as it matures unless the leadership applies Whole Brain Thinking to consciously cultivate and encourage the breadth of thinking that is necessary for ongoing success.</strong> We tend to hire, coach, promote, and otherwise reward in our own image. It’s natural to be drawn to those who think the way we do. It’s easy. We have our own shorthand. But if we limit ourselves in this way, we’re missing the other perspectives and mental frames of reference we need in order to solve complex problems and find more innovative solutions. All that single-mindedness will lead to stagnation or worse. In the face of increasing complexity and intense competition, companies won’t be able to survive over the long term if they don’t deliberately look for, develop, and leverage the full spectrum of thinking.</p>

<p class="centers">It is what you learn after you know it all that counts.</p>

<p class="indent">As you read this book, you’ll discover that the way you communicate, learn, make decisions, plan your work processes, choose your career, deal with customers, manage people, allocate attention, and handle every other aspect of your business performance is rooted in how you prefer to think. Imagine how much you’ll be able to accomplish—how much more productive, more <a id="page_10"></a>focused, and more flexible you’ll be—once you understand and know how to use all your thinking to your advantage.</p>
