<p class="noindent">“Ned Herrmann was way ahead of his time. Long before neuroscience became all the rage, Ned was talking and writing about the mind-body connection and about how we think impacts how we act. He was a pioneer, a genius, and pathfinder. Ann Herrmann-Nehdi has done the world a huge favor by updating Ned’s seminal work, <em>The Whole Brain Business Book,</em> and reintroducing us to the power we each have when we use all of what we’re given. This book is rich in ah-ha moments and a treasure trove of practical tips on how to apply Whole Brain Thinking at work, home, and in the community. This is an extraordinary performance, a <em>tour de force</em>, and a must read for everyone who wants to apply their whole selves in whatever they do.”</p>
<p class="attribution2"><strong>—Jim Kouzes,</strong> coauthor of <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> and Dean’s Executive Fellow of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University</p>
<p class="noindent">“Ned Herrmann and Ann Herrmann-Nehdi know more about the brain than anyone. If you want to function better, this is a must read.”</p>
<p class="attribution2"><strong>—Ken Blanchard,</strong> coauthor of <em>The One Minute Manager</em></p>
<p class="noindent">“Whether you’re new to the Whole Brain model, or ready for a twenty-first century update to the classic volume, this book is a must read for anyone with a brain. You will learn how your mind works, how to improve and expand your thinking style, and how to better understand and communicate with the brains around you.”</p>
<p class="attribution2"><strong>—Daniel H. Pink,</strong> author of <em>Drive</em> and <em>A Whole New Mind</em></p>
<p class="noindent">“This book delivers on two capabilities that leaders at every level should have: first, to truly know that we all actually process the world differently, and second, to start to really think about thinking itself.”</p>
<p class="attribution2"><strong>—David Rock,</strong> author of <em>Your Brain at Work,</em> and Director, NeuroLeadership Institute</p>
<p class="noindent">“We know that being innovative requires a Whole Brain process and team. We also know that we live in a ‘whole-brained’ world. Whether you want to work smarter or appeal to a broad audience, you have to first understand how different people think.”</p>
<p class="attribution2"><strong>—Shannon Loftis,</strong> General Manager, Redmond Games Publishing at Microsoft</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_b"></a>“Ann has done a masterful job of updating Ned’s original work, by including a contemporary neurological perspective on brain functioning while connecting this to the latest thinking on human performance, interpersonal effectiveness and organizational design. The Whole Brain Model and HBDI are powerful tools for both understanding human behavior and helping everyone to achieve their ‘whole brain’ potential.”</p>

<p class="noindent">“I have been in leadership and consulting roles for almost 45 years. <em>The Whole Brain Business Book</em> took me to a new place for the first time in over 20 years. The clients I work with create completely new mindsets as a result of exposure to this approach.”</p>
<p class="attribution2"><strong>—Mike Packard,</strong> Founder and CEO, TransCat Consulting, and former Executive Vice President, LensCrafters</p>
<p class="noindent">“An affirming catalyst to elevate us to the level of engagement we desire most in working with others.”</p>
<p class="attribution2"><strong>—Daryl B. Hammett, Sr.,</strong> CEO, Peabody Executive Coaching and Performance Management Group, and former Senior Vice President and General Manager, Sears Optical</p>
<p class="noindent">“In my experience with technical teams in universities and industry, the Whole Brain model provides a first-order engineering approximation to mental diversity that encourages collaborators to empathize nonjudgmentally, thereby enabling them to better leverage their intellectual excellence, spur their creativity, and make pragmatic contributions that really matter to people.”</p>
<p class="attribution2"><strong>—Charles E. Leiserson,</strong> Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</p>
<p class="noindent">“We have a much stronger unit with everyone understanding what everyone brings to the table. I use Whole Brain Thinking daily. It has made a difference in my personal and professional life, and I know it has for my team members as well.”</p>
<p class="attribution2"><strong>—Brian Wheeler,</strong> Director of Operations, Lastar, Inc.</p>
<p class="noindent">“Other models are more focused on behavior, so it’s harder to have a conversation about problem solving. Whole Brain Thinking is more applicable in the workplace because it’s about the way you think and solve problems. It facilitates a good work discussion.”</p>
