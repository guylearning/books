<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Hard data support the finding that the preferences of the world’s population are equally distributed across the four quadrants of the Whole Brain Model.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Any organization of more than 100 people is likely to have thinking preference diversity available to it.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Leaders of such companies typically do not lead on the basis of the full diversity of thinking in their workforce.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Every ethnic group, on average, has a balance of thinking preferences represented. When the preferences are combined, this balance will show up as a Whole Brain profile.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he event was an American Creativity Association conference. Ann and I had our presentation prepared, and we knew what activities we wanted to conduct during the workshop. But at the last minute, just before the attendees began streaming into the room, we had an idea: What if we divided the participants into two groups, on the two sides of the room—one composed only of male participants, the other only of females? Would that affect the activities and how the participants completed them? The group dynamics? The outcomes?</p>
<p class="indent">There was plenty of grumbling when we instructed the attendees to split up by gender. It was as if we were blatantly violating the rules of political correctness. “What are you trying to prove?” they wanted to know. “Are you implying something?” The truth was, we didn’t know for sure how much difference we would find between the male group’s creative interactions, processes, and outcomes and the female group’s. After all, they were all members of a creativity association, so as a group, they had a lot in common.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_62"></a>The first thing we asked them to do was to work together within their gender-specific groups and answer the question, “What is the most important thing for you to accomplish, the ultimate goal of creativity?”</p>
<p class="indent">When they presented their results, Ann and I were stunned.</p>
<p class="indent">We knew from brain research that there are differences in the physiology of the brains of males and females. For example, while the human male brain is larger on average than the average female brain, the neurons in the cortex of the female brain are packed closer together, and female brains possess more neurons than male brains. There are other physiological differences that scientists are continually discovering, and our own data consistently shows a difference in thinking preferences, with males tilting more toward the A quadrant and females tilting more toward the C quadrant (see <a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#ch05fig1">Figure 5-1</a>). This data difference between males and females holds true around the world.</p>

<p class="figcap"><small><strong>FIGURE 5-1</strong></small> Male and female profile averages from the HBDI database.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet even knowing all this, we were still shocked at how plainly the differences manifested themselves behaviorally in our workshop. In answering our first question, about their approach to creativity, the males overwhelmingly talked about creating a unique, tangible thing—building “stuff” with a specific outcome. The females, on the other hand, talked about the environment and helping people, producing the conditions for creativity, making changes that would affect people in a positive way, and doing something important. Neither of these answers was “right” or “wrong,” and in fact, both are essential. But the interesting thing was how neatly their responses aligned with our data, even down to the few outliers in each group—a factor that also shows up in our research. (For more on creative thinking, see <a class="nounder" href="ch21.html#ch21">Chapters 21</a>, <a class="nounder" href="ch22.html#ch22">22</a>, and <a class="nounder" href="ch23.html#ch23">23</a>.)</p>

<p class="att"><strong>—Ann Herrmann-Nehdi</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Again, these were people who, on the whole, had a lot in common, specifically a passion for creative thinking. But for all their similarities, they still experienced things differently based on their gender.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the reasons I wanted to share this story with you is that it’s a good introduction to the idea of difference. Difference is everywhere, and one of the most obvious differences is that between male and female.</p>
<p class="indent">How do you start to deal with difference, particularly when it comes to thinking? In their article “Putting Your Company’s Whole Brain to Work,” published in the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, Dorothy Leonard and Susaan Straus<sup><a id="ch05end1a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch05end1">1</a></sup> put it succinctly: “Start with yourself. When you identify your own style, you gain insight into the ways your preferences unconsciously shape your style of leadership and patterns of communication.”</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">We shall not perish as a people even if we get our money supply wrong— but if we get our human relationships wrong, we shall destroy ourselves.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Right Reverend Robert Runcie, Archbishop of Canterbury</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The previous chapters focused on your own thinking preferences and how they play out. But of course, you aren’t an island; in work as well as in your personal life, you’re going to be interacting with other individuals, and that means you’re going to come up against thinking preferences and patterns that are similar to yours and others that are different from yours to one degree or another. It’s often easier to work with someone whose thinking preferences are like our own. It’s as if we are operating in our own shorthand, and such people instantly seem to <a id="page_64"></a>“get” us. But it’s not always possible, or even likely, that you’ll be surrounded by people who prefer to think the way you do. In fact, difference is more often the norm.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Thinking Across the World</h4>
<p class="noindent">Taking it a step further, one of the things we’ve learned from the data we’ve collected is that not only can you expect differences, but you can expect <em>balance</em>: organizations, ethnic groups, and any group of a large enough size will have a balanced distribution across all four quadrants of the Whole Brain Model. One way to put it is that the world is a composite Whole Brain Thinking distribution.</p>
<p class="indent">Our hard data from around the world demonstrate this finding conclusively. Studies conducted in the United States and in many countries have a common theme. If the sample size is large enough—1,000, 500, 250, or even as low as 100—the composite of individual HBDI Profiles represents a highly diverse but well-balanced distribution across the four quadrants of the Whole Brain Model. This is true in all parts of the world. <a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#ch05fig2">Figure 5-2</a> shows some sample composite profiles.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch05fig2"></a><img src="f0065-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="677" height="652"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><small><strong>FIGURE 5-2</strong></small> HBDI composite profiles of organizations from around the world: (a) Global chemical company, (b) African bank, (c) Asia-Pacific small food company, (d) U.S. midsize software company.</p>
<p class="indent">CEOs are always surprised by the balanced data representing the composite of their employees. They often think their organizations have a tilt to one side, often reflecting the mental preferences of the leadership team or the culture of the company. As a result, they aren’t managing or leading their companies on the basis of the composite Whole Brain reality of their organizations. Their leadership and communication styles have been either tilted in one direction or too confined for the global nature of the thinking and learning styles of their employees.</p>
<p class="indent">I estimate the costs of business leaders holding wrong assumptions about the mentality of their human assets at hundreds of millions of dollars in lost profits resulting from misalignment in expectations, jobs, training, communication, and leadership.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you imagine the difference in performance that would result if companies were managed in a style that is in alignment with their human resource assets? If we now widen the lens to include not only their own organization but also their customers and the general public, the implications become even more profound. Leaders must now rethink their external assumptions as well as their internal practices, particularly if they are in consumer-oriented businesses.</p>
<p class="indent">Think of all the content creators today. If they’re looking for the broadest readership possible, how could the editing be modified to make that happen? Widening the lens even further includes the composite Whole Brain reality in <a id="page_65"></a>educational institutions. It stands to reason that if the student body is a composite Whole Brain, then that should also be the case for the faculty and the curriculum. In contrast to the data on the students, however, many learning institutions still don’t have a composite Whole Brain faculty or a composite Whole Brain curriculum.</p>
<p class="indent">A striking example is the freshman class of a large midwestern university. The composite average shown in <a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#ch05fig3">Figure 5-3</a> represents approximately 500 entering freshmen in the School of Engineering.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch05fig3"></a><img src="f0066-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="402" height="452"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><small><strong>FIGURE 5-3</strong></small> HBDI composite profile of freshman entering a large midwestern university engineering program. Note the whole range of mental preferences.</p>
<p class="indent">This extraordinarily well-balanced composite was a shock to everybody, with the exception of the dean of engineering, who intuitively knew that there was a mismatch between the faculty and the students and that this condition would lead to extremely adverse consequences.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_66"></a>Shown in <a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#ch05fig4">Figure 5-4</a> is a composite average profile of the faculty of the School of Engineering, alongside the average profile of the entering seniors four years later, as provided by Edward and Monika Lumsdaine’s<sup><a id="ch05end2a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch05end2">2</a></sup> research. As you can see, the average profile of the entering seniors emulates that of the faculty. What you don’t see are all those who failed to make the grade, transferred to another school, or dropped out because of unsolvable frustration. Those who didn’t make it to graduation were predominantly C- and D-quadrant thinkers. Could they have been successful if the faculty members had recognized this and appealed to a broader spectrum of thinking styles in their teaching methods and approach?</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch05fig4"></a><img src="f0067-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="677" height="350"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><small><strong>FIGURE 5-4</strong></small> HBDI database average profile of engineering faculty and the HBDI composite of entering seniors at a large midwestern university.</p>
<p class="indent">I think this example of an engineering school could be duplicated in most of the colleges and universities around the world. To compound the tragedy, even when those responsible know that they have been holding the wrong assumptions about their students or their employees, they often do not commit themselves to changing what they are doing and the way they are doing it. There are some exceptions, and these champions of human resource development will someday be recognized for their achievements.</p>
<p class="indent">Our worldwide database is so far-ranging that readers could pick their own categories and the answer would be essentially the same. What are the thinking preference characteristics of a particular ethnic group, for example? When <a id="page_67"></a>separate composite profiles are developed for each identifiable ethnic group, on the average, they produce a composite Whole Brain; there is essentially no difference in brain dominance preferences between populations of whites, blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asians.</p>
<p class="indent">Thinking preferences, of course, do not equal intelligence. An individual’s HBDI thinking profile describes the degree of that person’s mental preferences in each quadrant. There are an infinite number of discrete profiles for the world as a whole and for each ethnic group. A study of our database a few years ago showed that when those individual profiles are assembled into a composite whole and averaged, the result is a 1-1-1-1 balanced profile. (For more information on the HBDI preference codes, see the HBDI Profile Interpretation Guide in the appendix.) The composite profiles for the different ethnic groups and the world in general from our study are shown in <a class="nounder" href="ch05.html#ch05fig5">Figure 5-5</a>.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch05fig5"></a><img src="f0068-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="551" height="623"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><small><strong>FIGURE 5-5</strong></small> HBDI composite average profiles for African American, Asian, Caucasian, Latino, Native American ethnicities.</p>
<p class="indent">While these profiles are not a measure of intelligence, they are a measure of competency potential. The composite Whole Brain distribution for all ethnic groups taken together suggests that the distribution of competency potential is similar within each ethnic group.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe that in each ethnic group, there is an equal potential for such occupational aspirations as pilots, physicians, nurses, teachers, social workers, technologists, scientists, stockbrokers, engineers, police officers, musicians, entrepreneurs, researchers, and managers. These are, of course, only examples, because I could fill the book with examples of specific occupations.</p>
<p class="indent">From a business perspective, it is important to note that occupational choices cross national and cultural boundaries. The HBDI Profiles of airline <a id="page_68"></a>pilots are approximately the same regardless of their ethnic or cultural background. The reason is that the work requirements are the same for airline pilots from India, China, Japan, Germany, France, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, and the United States. The same is true for nurses, pathologists, or engineers. The more rigorous the professional requirements, the more likely it is that the profiles of occupational colleagues will be similar. The reason, again, is that the work requirements are approximately the same regardless of the culture or the ethnic population. Remarkably, the same is true for CEOs, with a few slight differences based on region, as described in detail in <a class="nounder" href="ch20.html#ch20">Chapter 20</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In the idealized, and I believe attainable, world of the future, businesses will be able to find every capability they need in the composite of candidates representing all ethnic groups, cultures, and genders. Acquiring competence will be up to the individual, regardless of which group he or she is from. Designing jobs to take advantage of available competencies and aligning workers with those jobs is up to the managers of the business.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><a id="page_69"></a><strong>Thinking Differences at Home</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">When people want to improve their dealing with differences in the workplace, I often tell them that they have the perfect opportunity to practice over breakfast. In working with thousands of people over the years, we’ve asked them where they think the preferences of their partner, spouse, or significant other lie, and anecdotally, we can say that opposites attract— at least in first marriages. On the other hand, couples in second and third marriages, as well as unmarried couples who are living together, are generally more similar in their thinking preferences. Perhaps the unmarried couples think so much alike that they don’t feel the need for a formal contract. And maybe couples in their second and third marriages have figured out that they just don’t want to work that hard anymore!</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4a">Male and Female Brains at Work</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s go back to our participants at the creativity conference for a moment. We know there’s a mental tilt in the direction of the A quadrant for males and the C quadrant for females, and we saw this play out in the workshop—but so what? What are the implications and consequences of this in the workplace?</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Once, power was considered a masculine attribute. In fact, power has no sex.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Katharine Graham</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In terms of work that people really love to do, there is a pretty even distribution across the occupational options, with the exception of those jobs that require strong competencies in technical, numerical, logical, analytical, or diagnostic work, which are more heavily tilted toward males. In contrast, the kind of work with a heavy C-quadrant orientation is primarily relationship-based, requiring competency in understanding feelings and interpersonal transactions. Many men are uninterested or actively dislike— and as a result, haven’t built up competencies in—handling the sensitivity and patience required in these kinds of jobs. There is ongoing research exploring the differences in the structures of male and female brains that may one day more fully explain the physiological reasons for the way these differences play out. But the differences are there, and they show up consistently.</p>
<p class="indent">But then, of course, there are women who “think more like men” and men who “think more like women.” The reality is that, given any kind of career options, men and women will sort themselves out into jobs that align with their interests and thus their preferences.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><a id="page_70"></a><strong>Women in STEM</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">There has been a concerted effort to create opportunities and encourage more women to take part in the traditionally male-heavy STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines. An integral part of these educational programs has been a focus on teaching approaches, specifically using methods that are proven to engage <em>all</em> students. I agree wholeheartedly. If we want to build confidence and encourage people to pursue all sorts of educational opportunities and career paths, we need teaching and learning methods that appeal to a wide range of learners.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4a">The Benefits of Gender Balance</h4>
<p class="noindent">For all their grumbling at the outset of the creativity conference workshop, a funny thing happened after the groups got over the “political incorrectness” of being separated along gender lines: they started having fun. They were laughing and joking, there was lots of lively discussion, and they were really enjoying themselves. It was easy to work in these gender-aligned groups.</p>
<p class="indent">But there are important differences in male and female thinking preferences that would argue for gender-balanced teams as the most effective generally, and particularly when creative problem solving is involved.</p>
<p class="indent">Examining the characteristics that typify male thinking and female thinking can lead to only one conclusion, and that is that a creative team leader wants both. It has been demonstrated over and over that teams made up of people with diverse thinking styles produce more creative solutions than homogeneous teams. In fact, for most tasks in today’s environment, any team leader will benefit from thinking diversity. (In <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</a>, we will discuss more of the specific research and business examples that demonstrate the power of diverse thinking in teams.) I can say flatly that it is not possible to create the optimum Whole Brain team with only one gender involved. The differences are both subtle and profound. You cannot get to where you want to be mentally without having both males and females involved in the process.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Strength lies in differences, not in similarities.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Stephen R. Covey</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Over the years, my organization has had many opportunities to test out these conclusions. In all the workshops that we offer, there are opportunities for team interaction, and although it is our objective to build gender-balanced, diverse, heterogeneous teams, sometimes the logistics of a particular workshop <a id="page_71"></a>don’t allow for that ideal combination. Therefore, we have the opportunity to observe relatively similar or homogeneous teams, both in thinking style and in gender, as they undertake creative workshop assignments. Homogeneous teams of either gender tend to reach early consensus and settle too quickly on what prove to be mediocre conclusions. In comparison, gender-balanced, diverse, heterogeneous teams not only consume all the time allowed, but also ask for additional time and almost invariably produce the highest, most imaginative creative results.</p>
<p class="indent">When I ask each team to describe its team process, the members of the homogeneous teams of either gender talk about the smoothness of the team interaction, the relative speed with which they decided what to do, and the ease with which the team roles were assigned and carried out. The members of the heterogeneous teams of either gender talk about the difficulties of team interaction, highlighting the struggle they had in deciding on a plan of action—for example, carrying out of the individual roles and the difficulty of putting those roles together to make a unified presentation of the results. The gender-balanced heterogeneous teams experienced similar difficulties in time management and independent role development, but in most cases, they had such a superior grasp of the team’s conclusions that the team members could contribute independently yet synergistically.</p>
<p class="indent">Some business cultures and industries claim that they don’t have the necessary balance of genders to be able to form gender-balanced heterogeneous teams. One of the reasons they don’t feel that they have the correct balance is that they are overlooking a large number of employees whom they don’t feel qualify as potential team members. Many people who hold this view are missing the point. It is not the organizational level of a potential team member that qualifies him or her, but rather the quality and style of the person’s thinking. Since most organizations are, in fact, a composite Whole Brain, most of them do in fact have the balance of genders and styles required to form all the teams they would ever need.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>Twenty-First Century Research Confirms the Importance of Gender Balance</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Years ago, when Ned Herrmann originally proposed that gender-balanced heterogeneous teams would be more creative and effective, the idea seemed reasonable to most people, but was challenged by others who felt that it was too politically correct or too difficult to prove. At last there is research that substantiates this premise.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72"></a>Coauthored by MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and Union College researchers, the study sought to better understand how groups perform and, more specifically, what might facilitate or hinder that performance: “We set out to test the hypothesis that groups, like individuals, have a consistent ability to perform across different kinds of tasks”, says Anita Williams Woolley,<sup><a id="ch05end3a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch05end3">3</a></sup> the paper’s lead author and an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business.</p>
<p class="indent">“Our hypothesis was confirmed, continues Thomas W. Malone, a coauthor and Patrick J. McGovern Professor of Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management. “We found that there is a general effectiveness, a group collective intelligence, which predicts a group’s performance in many situations.”</p>
<p class="indent">The researchers found that groups showing greater “social sensitivity,” which entails perceiving others’ emotions effectively, performed better than other groups, especially those that were dominated by one person. This social sensitivity factor was greater in groups with more women— which can also be substantiated by our data showing that women overall tend to have stronger preferences in that domain.</p>
<p class="indent">I have gotten mixed reactions to our gender-related research over the years. Some women find it offensive to imply that they are using their brains differently from the way men do. The facts and research prove, however, that women <em>do</em> use their brains differently, and that there are important consequences that emerge. Our differences can in fact be an advantage, as this research demonstrates.</p>
<p class="indent">Difference does not imply better or worse, right or wrong, but it may make our group process feel more annoying or cumbersome. Bringing together different preferences and styles into a group process may be inconvenient and require greater facilitation skills, but the fact is, when you can harness those varied styles effectively through Whole Brain Thinking techniques, you will get better results.</p>

<h4 class="h4a">Same Thinking Preference Competitiveness</h4>
<p class="noindent">We’ve talked a lot about difference in this chapter, but what about those who think similarly to us? There can still be challenges. While people with strikingly different thinking preferences often have difficulty understanding each other, those with very similar thinking preferences can become competitive with each other. What is happening here is that while the people’s thinking preferences are nominally very similar, there are some minor differences that could be just enough to give Person 1 a slightly different perception of a given situation compared to Person 2. This somewhat different perception could lead to, “We both have pretty much the same understanding, but my way is better than your way.”</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding about ourselves.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Carl Jung</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Here’s an example: two individuals with strongly rational (A/B quadrant) thinking preferences are developing a strategy concerning this year’s sales plan for one of their industrial customers. Two of the defining characteristics of rational thinkers are logical processing and analytic processing. In this example, Sam prefers both, but he is more logical than analytical. Marie also prefers both, but she is more analytical than logical. They team up to work on the same problem, with one tilting toward analysis and the other tilting toward logic.</p>
<p class="indent">Sam, the sales engineer, says that the customer has purchased 500 of the same motor every year for the past three years, and therefore we should project a minimum of 500 for this year.</p>
<p class="indent">Marie, the inside sales support engineer, says yes, but her analysis shows that the orders came in distinct cycles, with the majority coming in the second and fourth quarters, and this affects the manufacturing cycle. And what if the customer doesn’t order in the fourth quarter? This could adversely affect year-end results. Sam counters with the logic of a three-year track record. Marie argues that analysis has uncovered a buying pattern that could affect future business. They struggle to reach agreement on an issue where they are both partly right.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_74"></a>This form of thinking preference competition seems to favor the A/B left mode, but it can also take place in the upper mode, often in scientific research or an R&amp;D lab. For example, two R&amp;D physicists who share an A/D profile are working together to design a much thinner version of their core product. The person with rational preferences proposes a research study of all the known designs as the first step. That would be the obvious logical thing to do. In contrast, the physicist with experimental preferences would much rather play around with different combinations of existing components to determine which criteria contribute most to thinness. That would be the more interesting and creative way to start the task.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case you have two individuals, both with double primary preferences in the rational A quadrant and the experimental D quadrant, but with different mixes. One favors rational thinking a bit more than experimental, and the other favors experimental thinking a bit more than rational. They are clearly on the same track, but one sees a faster route to the finish line than the other. They argue about which approach will produce quicker results. Again, both are partly right, but each feels strongly that his approach is best.</p>
<p class="indent">As they work through their individual solutions to a problem, I can see these two people becoming quite competitive about which approach is best. It is likely that either the logical or the experimental approach would ultimately produce a solution, but because both of the people involved are aware of both approaches but favor one, they are often inclined to be quite competitive about the one they prefer.</p>
<p class="indent">The C/D right-mode and B/C lower-mode quadrants may be somewhat less susceptible to competition because people favoring these quadrants seem to compete with themselves rather than with others. They are also inclined to be softer in their approach and more attentive to their relationships. In contrast, people with the more pragmatic-oriented thinking preferences in A and D are more sharp-edged and assertive and less concerned with interpersonal relationships. Damn the torpedoes—full steam ahead!</p>
<p class="indent">My purpose in citing these examples is not to suggest that competition in thinking preferences is bad. In fact, competitive approaches can lead to better decisions and better solutions. My purpose is to suggest that there are consequences to pairing people with similar profiles. Most people would assume that, since their thinking preferences are so similar, two such people will be entirely compatible in a team situation. With these observations, I’m suggesting that the assumption of compatibility might be premature and that, in some cases, similar but not precisely the same thinking preferences could lead to vigorous competition. The leadership challenge would be to keep this competition healthy and synergistic rather than hostile and combative. The manager has to establish a climate that fosters interaction between members of an organization on the basis of creative added value.</p>

<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Hard HBDI Profile data from many companies, organizations, universities, schools, conventions, and other groups around the world clearly demonstrate that the world in general, and the business world in particular, represents a composite Whole Brain distribution of preferences.</p>
