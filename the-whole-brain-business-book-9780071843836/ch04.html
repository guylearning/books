<p class="para"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ust a few weeks before he was supposed to take the SAT, Karim, who is left-handed, was in an accident that injured his left hand. Not only was he unable to hold a pencil in his dominant hand, but he was also unable to reschedule the test. This was his last chance to take the SAT that year. Karim did the only thing he could do in the situation: he spent the weeks leading up to the test date practicing filling in bubbles on a sample answer sheet with his right hand.</p>
<p class="indent">For someone like Karim, who had spent his life developing strength and comfort using his left hand, practicing with his right hand was like building a brand-new muscle. He couldn’t remember a time when he’d had to put so much mental energy into the physical act of writing. But no matter how unnatural and exhausting it felt to him, he was highly motivated to make it work. When the test day came, he used his right hand and got through it.</p>
<p class="indent">Unless you’re one of the few people who are truly ambidextrous, you probably don’t think about which hand you’ll use when you write; you just do it. After a few million movements based on a proclivity for right or left, you’ve developed a lifetime of handedness preference and skill. In a different but analogous sense, your mental patterns, or dominances, have also developed into preferences that have become competencies. You go to them by default because they require less effort and are more comfortable, and as a result, you’ve strengthened them through repeated use, just as you would a muscle. <a id="page_46"></a>But there will be times when the situation will require you to go outside the comfort zones of your preferences. Like a left-hander writing with his right hand, it will probably be challenging, but if you’re motivated and deliberate about it, you <em>can</em> do it. And the more you practice it, the more effective you’ll be in <em>any</em> situation.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">One of the saddest experiences that can ever come to a human being is to awaken gray-haired and wrinkled, near the close of a very unproductive career, to the fact that all through the past years he has been using only a small part of himself.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Orison Swett Marden</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">But first, you may be wondering, how did your preferences develop to begin with? Are they permanent? Can they change?</p>
<h4 class="h4c">The Development of Preferences: It’s Nature <em>and</em> Nurture</h4>
<p class="noindent">Are we on a genetically programmed path that is determined by our genes and chromosomes? The answer is, “No, but….” We are, I believe, a product of both nature and nurture, and for most of us, it is the nurture aspect that predominates in determining who we are and who we can become. That is a message of hope! If we were limited to only our genetic inheritance, there would be no opportunity for each of us to develop into our own unique person. Little, if any, of the learning that takes place during our maturing process would have any effect. We would be the product of our genetic inheritance and nothing else. I don’t think there is a person alive who would accept that as an accurate description of who he or she is. It’s not nature <em>or</em> nurture that determines who we are; it’s nature <em>and</em> nurture. The basic building block of our adult self is the DNA of our inherited genes and chromosomes, but that’s only the beginning. From that foundation, we can each become the architect of a unique, emerging human being.</p>
<p class="indent">My research into the brain leads me to believe firmly that the grand design is to be whole—that the normal, ordinary, everyday brain is specialized and interconnected in ways that position it to develop as a balanced, multidominant brain that is capable of accessing and using all of its mental options. Since the Whole Brain Model was originally developed, the findings of numerous scientific studies, along with the musings of a variety of writers and thought leaders, only bolster this notion. However, our data on millions of individuals suggest that a small percentage of people end up being that exquisitely balanced. In the more typical case, as we mature mentally, we develop preferences for particular modes of processing.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_47"></a>These preferences emerge from latent patterning in our brain that leads to preferred characteristics that begin very subtly but are reinforced and grow stronger through daily use. As we respond to life’s learning opportunities, it’s natural that we learn to go to our strengths first, because they tend to win us praise and other rewards. As our behavior is positively reinforced, this further entrenches our favored pattern of performance, which, in turn, leads to ever-increasing praise, and therefore an intensified preference! This performance-praise feedback loop can turn a small difference in specialization into a powerful preference for one cognitive mode over another.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">I believe the grand design is to be whole.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Ned Herrmann</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">During the early stages of the maturing process, we really don’t know any better. By the time we are able to understand the consequences of this strengthening pattern development that’s becoming dominance, like handedness, our thinking patterns have already been established. Our mental preferences become mental defaults.</p>
<p class="indent">As we saw in <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, some of our mental patterns may develop into such strong preferences that they have led to competencies in particular ways of thinking. We have become very good at language, or we have developed impressive math skills, or we are exceedingly organized. We can accurately sense the feelings of others, or we are always coming up with new ideas. These early competencies arising out of preferences can lead to a path of similar mental processing clusters that affect our development.</p>
<p class="indent">Change and growth can follow the pursuit of our interests. As our interests develop and expand, they can result in enormous changes in our mental capacity and range of thinking. If we assume that the whole spectrum of mental options is preloaded into the developing brain, then the opportunities for growth and change are limitless (see <a class="nounder" href="part05.html">Part 5</a> for ideas on growth.)</p>
<p class="indent">The life experiences that produce change can also build walls that prevent change from taking place. Learning environments that limit rather than stimulate, or parents who refuse to allow a child to pursue his or her interests, not only thwart development but also erect barriers that foreclose on whole domains of thinking. Teachers who present information in ways that serve their own learning style deny learning to others who learn differently. Suffice it to say that the normal person has built into his or her brain a full set of mental processing options that can be accessed and applied if life’s circumstances don’t get in the way. At birth we have the <em>wiring to be whole</em>, and we can become more so by taking more complete charge of our own development.</p>

<h4 class="h4">On Being Whole-Brained</h4>
<p class="noindent">Should you aspire to a Whole Brain profile, that is, a profile with four strong primaries, one in each quadrant? Should your goal be a perfectly balanced 1-1-1-1? (For more information on the HBDI preference codes, see the HBDI Profile Interpretation Guide in the appendix.) The answer is a clear <em>no</em>. The world would be a dull place indeed if everyone faced life’s variable situations and decisions with such an equally distributed array of mental preferences.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">The people who get on in the world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and if they can’t find them, make them.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—George Bernard Shaw</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">What should be everybody’s objective is to be as <em>situationally</em> whole-brained as possible. This means that you continue to have the advantage of primary preferences that provide you with a leading response to everyday situations, but you are not <em>limited</em> by those preferences. You have a much broader spectrum of mental options available to you, options that can be accessed because you know of the existence of your situational capabilities, and you have practiced using these options to a sufficient extent for these secondary modes to represent competencies that you can count on. Because you have equal access to all four quadrants, when the situation calls for a given type of mental function, you can give it your best response. This is the skill of Whole Brain Thinking.</p>
<p class="indent">Make no mistake about it: there is an advantage to having strong primary preferences. Because of these preferences, you have developed interests that have led you to competencies, which represent your mental strengths. In a given situation, that’s where you look first for an answer or an appropriate response. In most cases, you don’t have to stop and think about everything you do. You go ahead and do it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_51"></a>As a case in point, over the years I have developed an uncanny ability for long-range planning. I have been able to conceptualize 5-, 10-, and 15-year goals and make them come true. It is less natural for me to devise short-term goals and develop detailed plans for achieving them. However, because I have become keenly aware of this difference in mental preferences, I have developed a competence and discipline in short-term planning that I use whenever I have to. In earlier times, I would have concentrated on the long-range thinking that came naturally to me. Now that I know I have an available option, I am able to access and apply short-term planning competencies, including dealing with excruciating detail. I do it when I have to because it’s useful to me. I don’t do it when I don’t have to because it doesn’t stimulate me and I tend to find it boring. The point is, now that I know what my mental options are, I am able to be much more situationally whole. Knowing my preferences and my mental options positions me to supplement my existing competencies with needed situational competencies. The same could be true for you. In <a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>, consider a day in which you need to analyze the performance data for a key product, work on finalizing the details of next year’s budget, hold a one-on-one coaching session with an assistant, and play around with some ideas for the new marketing campaign. All of these modes are situationally available to us all, and it may be more difficult to access the mode that is least preferred.</p>

<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_52"></a>Seeing Things from the Viewpoint of Our Least-Preferred Quadrant</h4>
<p class="noindent">Each of us is a coalition of four different selves, but we prefer to use one or more of those selves compared to the others. All HBDI Profiles are made up of most-preferred and least-preferred thinking modes.</p>
<p class="indent">It is interesting to group people together on the basis of their most-preferred and least-preferred thinking modes. When those in the group have the same most-preferred mode, they can typically reach an easy consensus on subjects that fall into the domain of their thinking preferences. However, this is not the case when people are dealing with least-preferred thinking modes. When people are grouped together on the basis of their least-preferred quadrants, the group is <em>heterogeneous</em> in terms of primary preferences and <em>homogeneous</em> in terms of nonpreferences. Unless you give its members a special assignment in their common area of least-preferred thinking, they will exhibit the behaviors of a diverse group and therefore will have difficulty in achieving consensus. Since there is a shared lack of preference for a particular mental domain, there is an opportunity for group learning to take place. For example, using communication as the theme for an assignment, we will group people together on the basis of their least-preferred quadrants and then ask them to play the role of reporters at an accident scene (see <a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch04fig4"></a><img src="f0052-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="676" height="437"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><small><strong>FIGURE 4-4</strong></small> Examples of four reporters’ views of the same accident. Each one represents a different quadrant viewpoint.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_53"></a>They are asked to interpret the accident through the stereotypical perceptions of reporters who don’t like to use a particular quadrant in their perceiving and writing about an event. Let’s take the C quadrant as an example. If we group together four or five people who don’t prefer to think and write in C-quadrant language, but require them to do so for this assignment, they will typically develop an extremely stereotypical version of a C-quadrant newspaper story. It will be filled with emotion and people issues. They will enjoy doing it, and it will be a hilarious experience. But the important outcome is that they will learn a bit about how to perceive an event in C-quadrant terms and how to write about it using C-quadrant language.</p>
<p class="indent">The exercise in least-preferred thinking quickly reveals that the stereotype in the C quadrant is <em>emotionality</em>. In the A quadrant, it is <em>facts</em>; in the B quadrant, it is <em>details</em>; and in the D quadrant, it is <em>off-the-wall future “stuff.”</em> Even though the stereotypes are ridiculous in the extreme, the assignment provides practice in thinking and writing in ways that these individuals <em>almost</em> never use and typically disregard when those who <em>prefer</em> to use these modes would do so in a business situation. Walking in the shoes of the people who prefer the things that we least prefer provides an instant wake-up call to the need to pay more attention to what others are saying, and to have more respect for the way they are saying it. Since we are living in a composite Whole Brain world, and since the reality of any multifunctional group is the diversity of its thinking and therefore its perceptions and language, it is essential from a communications standpoint that we increase our tolerance and understanding of what people who are different from us are saying. (See <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a> for more on improving communication through Whole Brain Thinking.)</p>

<h4 class="h4a">How Mental Preferences Play Out in Decision Making</h4>
<p class="noindent">Decision making is a common business area where your mental preferences play out, and where you can learn to draw on the strengths of your preferences and tap into your four selves to be more effective.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the years, your decision-making processes will have developed a consistent pattern that is grounded in your preferences. Strongly A-quadrant-oriented thinkers, who prefer facts, become very rational when there are facts <a id="page_54"></a>upon which to base a decision. When there are not any facts, their decision process is less effective. B-quadrant-oriented thinkers are looking for details. They don’t want to make a mistake, so they will delay a decision until they are confident that they know everything there is to know and that there will be no surprises down the road. Without the benefit of careful, deliberate consideration, their decision process is less effective.</p>
<p class="indent">The C-quadrant decision process is based not only on a strong preference for preserving relationships, but also on a general avoidance of the analysis of facts and figures. Therefore, the C-quadrant decision process is largely intuitive and more focused on people issues. The D-quadrant decision process is different from the other three quadrants in that it is inclined to be variable: sometimes bold, assertive, and daring, and at other times impulsive and spontaneous.</p>
<p class="indent">Because so many businesspeople have double and triple dominances, there are decision styles that are combinations of these single-quadrant styles. The double-dominant A/B left-mode style, for example, has a need for both facts and details, for both logical analysis and step-by-step processing, whereas the double-dominant right-mode style combines the relationship-oriented, intuitive processes of the C quadrant with the more variable, bold and daring, and sometimes vacillating style of the D quadrant.</p>
<p class="indent">The double-dominant upper style (A and D) can be thought of as the scientific approach to decision making. It’s a potentially synergistic combination of logical, analytic, rational processing and bold, daring, and frequently imaginative ideas. An exemplar of this style might be Captain Kirk of <em>Star Trek</em>. The double-dominant, B-quadrant/C-quadrant lower style is more typified by a supervisory nurse’s decision-making style—structured, procedural, and conservative, yet highly people-oriented. It is sensitive but careful, spiritual but traditional, with lots of detail but a deep concern for human values.</p>
<p class="indent">Double dominance in the B and D quadrants is a more perplexing style. This can make it feel as if the decision maker has “one foot on the accelerator and one foot on the brake,” alternating between risk taking and safekeeping, or between big, bold, daring alternatives and conservative, high-security options. The double-dominant A/C profile also exhibits internal confrontation between two very different preferences—on the one hand, the strong A-quadrant preference for rational decision making, and on the other, an equally strong preference for feelings, relationships, and people issues. Businesspeople for whom <a id="page_55"></a>this is the everyday decision-making style shuttle back and forth between a consideration of facts and a consideration of human relationships. They typically agonize over their decisions that are hurtful to people.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">To grow as human beings, to guide our conduct, we also look for universal principles: absolute values.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Keshavan Nair</strong></p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5aa">Whole Brain Decision Making</h5>
<p class="noindent">Just as our preferences affect how we focus and what we focus on when we’re making a decision, our areas of lesser preference can become blind spots. Those who have strong A- and B-quadrant preferences may fail to recognize the “people” consequences of a decision, or they may be so risk-averse that they stagnate because they always choose the “safe” option. People who have strong preferences in all quadrants, on the other hand, often analyze well but don’t make decisions at all. Ultimately, there are no “good” or “bad” ways to make a decision—only consequences! Your goal should be to manage the consequences of your thinking preferences effectively.</p>

<p class="att"><strong>—Janet Rae-Dupree</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">As a result, situational wholeness is especially useful when it comes to decision making. Each of the different quadrants offers different strengths and adds value to the decision-making process, so when all quadrants are considered, we will arrive at a better overall decision. The Whole Brain Decision-Making Walk-Around (see <a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>) is a tool to help ensure that we “walk around” the four-quadrant model, asking appropriate questions regarding each aspect of the mental processes involved. For example, have we done a rigorous consideration of the facts? Have we examined the details in the chronology of events? Have we factored in all the people issues and dealt with relationships? Did we take a big-picture view of the entire situation, and have we factored in the future that is appropriate to our conclusion?</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch04fig5"></a><img src="f0055-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="662" height="357"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><small><strong>FIGURE 4-5</strong></small> Whole Brain decision-making walk-around.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_56"></a>The decision-making model provides a discipline to the process that requires a step-by-step consideration of each quadrant-specific aspect of our decision process. Several round trips provide an even better chance that all major aspects of the decision situation have been dealt with. A better decision should result.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>Put It to Work</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Take a moment to think about a decision that you recently made, ideally a big decision that did not have the outcome you desired. Look over the Decision-Making Walk-Around and analyze which quadrants you paid most attention to. Which did you overlook? How might the decision have been affected if you’d used a whole-brained approach?</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebar1ba">
<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>Intuition and Pattern Seeking: Shortcut or Trap?</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes we make decisions without elaborate thought. Going with our gut, or relying on intuition, allows us to make decisions quickly. We don’t need to discuss the decision at length; instead, based on how we feel about the decision, we just go ahead and make it.</p>
<p class="indent">Intuition is a natural process, and once we understand it, we can use it more effectively. As with all mental skills, we can develop our intuition over time. It requires allowing our unconscious mind to come up with the answer rather than processing it consciously. There are other ways the brain works to make the decision-making process faster for us, but sometimes these shortcuts are traps. Designed to be highly efficient, your brain is a pattern-searching machine. It’s actually lazy. Whenever you encounter a situation or an issue, your brain looks to see if it has “seen” this before, and if it has, it activates that part of the brain. This is why you may have already arrived at a decision in your head before a colleague has even finished describing the situation. That efficiency has a downside, though, because it gets in the way of our ability to take our thinking to a new place. This type of cognitive bias was called “the curse of knowledge” by Robin <a id="page_57"></a>Hogarth, and it has been explored in many contexts, including in Chip and Dan Heath’s book <em>Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die</em>.<sup><a id="ch04end1a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch04end1">1</a></sup> You can sidestep the curse of knowledge by tricking the brain with novelty and mind-shifters that are often called “mind hacks.”</p>
<p class="indent">As an example, recent research has shown that people who speak a foreign language can reduce their inherent decision bias by thinking about the decision in the other language. “A foreign language provides a distancing mechanism that moves people from the immediate intuitive system to a more deliberate mode of thinking,” wrote Boaz Keysar,<sup><a id="ch04end2a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch04end2">2</a></sup> professor of psychology at the University of Chicago. This forces the brain to move to a more logical and conscious process, thereby eliminating the frequently instinctive emotional decision bias.</p>
<p class="indent">You can create this same effect even if you don’t speak a foreign language. Try stepping into the shoes of another role or another person whom you know. This intentional shift will engage your brain to better decipher the issue at hand from a different perspective and bring it to mind consciously. An easy technique is to visualize your living room and imagine what an interior designer might notice about it. Next, imagine what a thief might notice. How about a housekeeper? A real estate agent? This simple activity demonstrates how easily we can get in touch with other viewpoints. The mere process shifts our thinking.</p>
<p class="indent">Our mental defaults can become mental blind spots and potential roadblocks to our truly arriving at the best, most balanced decisions. The good news is that we can learn to override these defaults, but it requires understanding and remaining aware and mindful of our mental process so that we can manage <em>it</em> rather than having our mental process manage <em>us</em>.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4a">Your Preferences and Job Success</h4>
<p class="noindent">What about in our day-to-day work? Our strong primaries often represent work activities that stimulate us, and our lower preferences almost always represent work activities that drain us. When people aren’t stimulated by the work they are doing, they drop out of the game. They become selectively blind and deaf to the discussions and activities that are taking place in their areas of avoidance. If a person has avoidance in one of the quadrants, and a large percentage of the work he or she has to do falls into that quadrant, then the likelihood of job success is enormously reduced.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><a id="page_58"></a><strong>What Motivates You?</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Just as having a preference for a type of work doesn’t mean that you’ll necessarily be good at it, you may also discover that you have skills and competencies in activities you don’t particularly like. Career progression and work opportunities bring a full range of competency options into view, and as part of this process, many people realize that although they have performed well at certain tasks and jobs, they didn’t really like them. The link between preferences and competencies helps explain why money isn’t the primary motivator for most people at work. As Frederick Herzberg’s<sup><a id="ch04end3a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch04end3">3</a></sup> seminal research showed, negative environmental factors such as low pay can be demotivating, but the reverse isn’t true; instead, he found, people were motivated by interesting work, challenges, and increasing responsibility. In his book <em>Drive,</em><sup><a id="ch04end4a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch04end4">4</a></sup> Daniel Pink reiterates this point, identifying autonomy, mastery, and purpose as the three elements that motivate us. Like many researchers and experts today, Pink warns against the “carrot and stick” management methods that rely on money as the key motivator, explaining that not only are they ineffective, but they can do more harm than good<em>.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Occupational mismatch, in which a person is assigned to work that does not fall into his or her area of preference, can produce very poor results. Take, for example, a financial manager who has a super-primary in the A quadrant and a preference in the C quadrant that is so low that it is clearly an avoidance. Because much of the mentality of financial work falls in the A quadrant, this person will typically perform well on all of the logical, analytical, quantitative aspects of the work, but he or she will often be selectively blind and deaf to the people aspects of his financial assignment. This person might be described as a “cold, heartless number cruncher” as a consequence of that avoidance. The finance job typically requires much more than just the ability to deal with numbers effectively. Therefore, this person’s avoidance in the C quadrant could seriously limit his or her ability to perform high-level finance work because, in most cases, it requires interest and competence in dealing with human resource issues. (See <a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a> for more about occupational “misfits.”)</p>
<p class="indent">Check this out yourself. Think about your coalition of preferences. Are they equally distributed, or do you have some strong attractions and possibly a few turn-offs? Go back to <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a> and review the exercise in which you listed the tasks in your current job and underlined those that you dislike or like the least. Reflect on the consequences of those underlined words for the work you <a id="page_59"></a>do and the way you do it. There are several action steps that you might consider. The first is to eliminate as many of these tasks as you can from your work assignment by delegating them or seeing if you can reassign them to a more appropriate person. But because this isn’t always possible or realistic, the second step is to begin to make friends with them. Do them in service of your preference. You might find that when you view the work elements you don’t like within the context of their contributing to the work you are highly stimulated by, you’ll be more motivated to handle them. It’s all about mindset.</p>
