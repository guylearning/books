<p class="para"><strong><span class="dropcap">I</span></strong>t was an interesting group—all headmasters of private schools from a region in the Southeast, gathered together to talk about improving overall student performance. But I could tell that one of the headmasters was distracted; his facial expressions and fidgeting were becoming harder and harder to ignore. So I decided I would take a moment to confer with him at the next break.</p>
<p class="indent">In the meantime, I introduced the next activity, one that involved using a metaphor. Suddenly this headmaster stood up and declared emphatically to the group: “Excuse me, excuse me. I don’t ‘do’ metaphors.” His intolerance for this activity that he clearly disliked—metaphors—was so strong that, even before experiencing it, he felt it necessary to stop the program!</p>
<p class="indent">Have you ever been to or participated in a training program, online learning, or any other sort of educational event that you absolutely hated? Maybe you were bored because to you, it felt like a one-way lecture, or you thought <a id="page_162"></a>the activities were too touchy-feely or boringly predictable. Or perhaps you were annoyed by the lack of structure and no clear agenda because it was so hard to follow the instructor’s train of thought. But then after the program was over, you discovered that some of your fellow participants had absolutely loved it. They felt it was one of the best learning programs they’d ever been to. You couldn’t believe it. How could they possibly have learned anything from that terrible program?</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">The only safe assumption is that every group represents a composite Whole Brain of thinkers and learners.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Ned Herrmann</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In the same way that we have built patterns of preference over the course of our lives as thinkers, each one of us as a learner is a unique human being with a unique learning preference. As a student, you probably did much better in some subjects than in others and responded much more favorably to some teachers and teaching methods than to others. Think of the teachers and content that you can still remember today—years later—and then try to recall those that were lost almost immediately after the learning. Our research has shown that you probably retained some material more accurately and for a longer period of time than other material that was <em>delivered in a different way</em>. Our unique learning preferences are the result of the brains we were born with, combined with the years of experience that have developed into our own distinctive learning approaches over the course of our lives.</p>
<p class="indent">The first application of my study of the brain and the evolving theory of Whole Brain Thinking was in the domain of management education at GE’s management education complex at Crotonville. The more I learned about the role of the brain in the learning process, the more curious and skeptical I became about the effectiveness of the programs I was involved with. To satisfy my curiosity, I began to evaluate the programs I was responsible for on the basis of what the participants actually learned and whether they learned what they were intended to learn. The study revealed that what the participants actually learned covered a wide spectrum within a course, even with a participant group of only 20 people. The study further revealed that less than half of that learning was the learning that was actually intended by the training program. This information was so shocking that I decided I could not report it to upper management without offering specific ways to correct the situation.</p>
<p class="indent">Further inquiry into the participants’ learning preferences revealed a wide range, with several significant subgroups showing similar learning preferences.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, I diagnosed the faculty members and discovered that they too had strong personal learning preferences. My curiosity then led me to examine the design of the various courses that were being taught. I discovered that these were <a id="page_163"></a>rather narrow in terms of the design methods used, and that they also seemed to match the learning preferences of the course leaders. No wonder we were having problems! The course design and the course leaders seemed to be in good alignment, but this was, in turn, in good alignment with only part of the class, perhaps as few as half. This meant that as many as half of the participants were so out of alignment with the course material and the course leaders that they were missing much of what they were intended to take back to their jobs.</p>
<p class="indent">In today’s world, learning is no longer relegated exclusively to the training department. The advent of coaching and mentoring, “leader as teacher,” and other initiatives have put managers and leaders squarely in the role of not just manager or leader, but also developer. The implications of these differences in learning preferences thus affect everyone—for each person’s own development and the development of others.</p>
<p class="indent">My research has not only shown that the business world, or any large organization taken as a whole, represents a composite array of thinking preferences that are equally distributed across the Whole Brain Model, but that the same is true for learning. In other words, there is a balanced distribution of learning preferences, with each quadrant and each mode being equally represented and seeking a particular learning approach. But that’s not all. There is also an equal distribution of learning <em>avoidances</em> across the four quadrants. And learning avoidances are even more significant than learning preferences because they cause people to tune out, just as the headmaster did with metaphors. Whether it is a learning, coaching, or mentoring program, a tuned-out learner is a waste of educational time and effort as well as corporate time and money.</p>
<h4 class="h4">The Impact of Design and Delivery on the Learning Outcome</h4>
<p class="noindent">Training and development budgets range from thousands to millions or even billions of dollars annually. Coaching and mentoring programs are now standard in most organizations. Much of this time, effort, and money may be wasted because people are expected to participate and learn in programs that are out of alignment with their learning preferences, out of alignment with their job needs, and out of alignment with their career paths. The degree of match between the learner and the development content, the way the learner learns best, and the mode of delivery are all critical considerations for achieving desired learning outcomes. If we fail to take them into account, the learner’s engagement and attention can be affected, and he or she will fail to build the expected skills or competencies. At best, the outcomes will be temporary. My experience tells me that at least half of those attending in-house training programs or participating in coaching or mentoring programs are seriously out of alignment in one or more of these specific measures (see <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#ch11fig1">Figure 11-1</a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch11fig1"></a><img src="f0164-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="677" height="873"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 11-1</small></strong> A Whole Brain group receiving intended learning through a Whole Brain design, compared with a delivery that addresses only left-mode preferences.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_164"></a>The alignment issue exists in programs in schools and universities as well. How many classes did you tune out of when you were in school? Our partner, Ann Louise de Boer, has conducted extensive research at the University of Pretoria that demonstrates how a Whole Brain Learning redesign improves learning outcomes in higher education. The research has looked at a range of learning challenges, documenting successful application of the approach in a <a id="page_165"></a>variety of areas. In one example, grades in the School of Dentistry improved by 30 percent after the tooth morphology class was transformed. Ann and her team have qualitative and quantitative research showing how results will improve once alignment has been established. Other programs and results highlighted in their book, <em>Whole Brain Learning in Higher Education: Evidence-Based Practices</em>,<sup><a id="ch11end1a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch11end1">1</a></sup> include engineering, information literacy, library leadership, management, and many others. Alignment clearly matters, and the team’s ongoing research continues to substantiate this.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>Learning Preferences Matter</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">In recent years, there has been some debate over the veracity of learning-styles research. A study conducted by the Learning and Skills Centre examined 13 models of learning styles, including the Whole Brain Teaching and Learning Model, and concluded that style matters when it comes to delivering effective learning and that the Whole Brain Model was a valid approach. The Centre’s report, <em>Should We Be Using Learning Styles?</em>,<sup><a id="ch11end2a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch11end2">2</a></sup> makes recommendations for students, teachers, trainers, managers, researchers, and others.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The implications for those of us who are managers, coaches, and mentors are significant. I believe that an understanding of thinking and learning styles matters both on a personal development level and in our responsibilities to grow those employees who report to us. Learning happens every day on the job, and understanding the way people learn is just as important as understanding how they think.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Education, learning, and changing are so closely related to problem solving that they may all be names for the same thing.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—George Prince</strong></p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4a">Growing Yourself: Own Your Learning</h4>
<p class="noindent">Think back to the last time you were fully engaged by a learning experience. Did it involve uncovering the facts, analyzing issues, and forming theories? Or maybe you had the opportunity to do hands-on practice: testing things out, following a clear, structured process. Perhaps you were working in a group, either face to face or online, listening and sharing ideas. Or were you experimenting with new concepts and ideas and growing through self-discovery? Once you understand how you prefer to learn, you can begin to take better control of your own growth and development.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle1"><a id="page_166"></a><strong>Put It to Work</strong></p>
<p class="noindentbs">Refer to the model in <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#ch11fig2">Figure 11-2</a> as you consider how your preferences affect your learning and your best learning experiences. Next, take a moment to reflect on the best learning experiences you have had over the course of your life.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="ch11fig2"></a><img src="f0166-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="563" height="458"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 11-2</small></strong> Whole Brain learning preference model summarizes learning styles by quadrant.</p>
<p class="bullet">• <em>Which quadrants tend to be your preferred learning approaches, those that engage you and incite greater learning?</em></p>
<p class="indentbs">Now think about examples of learning that you did not enjoy at all, the ones where you most tuned out of learning. What types of experiences triggered your tuning out?</p>
<p class="bullet">• <em>What are the consequences, and how many learning outcomes do you think you missed by tuning out?</em></p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4a"><a id="page_167"></a>How Our Preferences Affect Learning</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember the headmaster who declared that he did not “do metaphors”? That comment affected the way I handled the metaphor activity. I explained the rationale and the process we would use, as well as the intended outcome, so that he would buy into it and participate, and he did. When you’ve felt like tuning out, have you provided feedback or asked for alternative ways to access the content? Next time, consider asking for what you need and selecting programs that best represent your preferred approach so that you can get the most out of the experience. When you do not have a choice or are intentionally seeking a challenge, approach the learning experience as you would a new adventure, well rested and with a stretch mindset, knowing that it will take a lot more energy—and consider finding a learning partner you can work with to help.</p>
<p class="indent">People tend to assume that what works for them will also work for others, unless they know otherwise, so if you are learning in a coaching or mentoring situation, don’t be afraid to ask for what you need. Most coaches and mentors will be very happy to help. After all, they want to make sure that their time and effort are not wasted!</p>
<p class="indent">Now let me be clear: understanding your learning preferences isn’t about getting a free pass to check out when learning isn’t aligned with your preferences. It’s about recognizing when you might become disengaged and stretching yourself so that you can get the learning you need. You have access to all of these modes—you just need to find ways to make them work for you.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">If you are in education, you are in the business of brain development. If you are leading a modern corporation … you need to know how brains work.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Dr. John Medina</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">How does your learning mindset affect the way you learn? Significantly! Carol Dweck’s research at Stanford University found that people who believe that their brain and intelligence can be “built” like a muscle (a growth mind-set) will learn more effectively; those who do <em>not believe</em> that their brain can be built, that we are born with our intelligence “fixed” (a fixed mindset) will struggle. So we know that a growth mindset is critical in order to engage in the learning and to achieve learning outcomes.<sup><a id="ch11end3a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch11end3">3</a></sup> The very premise of Whole Brain Thinking substantiates this idea of a growth mindset. This, combined with the effective application of learning preferences to the learning process, can help instill that growth mindset. As a learner, you must first understand and believe that you <em>can</em> stretch your personal preferences and not get boxed in <a id="page_168"></a>by your preferred modes or use them as an excuse to disengage. You most likely have a long list of examples where that has occurred already in your lifetime. When you recognize and accept that you have the ability to think and learn beyond your preferences, you can “own” your learning, find the motivation, take responsibility for your success, and get support to better meet your needs.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>Learning on the Football Field: Getting What You Need to Win</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">A group of university football players at a top midwestern U.S. school used the HBDI assessment to help them uncover their learning preferences, and they saw a direct connection with their individual success and winning games on the field. They used the knowledge of how they think and learn to help both themselves and their coaches give and receive information more effectively in those crucial split seconds during a game, the make-or-break, win-or-lose moments. Everyone now knows how to make sure that the player or coach he is communicating with in that split second “gets it” as intended.</p>
<p class="indent">The correlation with the workplace—where speed of communication, comprehension, and application of learning have never been more critical—is clear.</p>
<p class="indent">One reason that informal learning, social learning, and communities of practice continue to grow in popularity is that they allow learners to ask for what they need “on the field” and better tailor the experience to fit their unique learning preferences.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4a">Growing Others</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the roles we have as managers and leaders is to support our employees in their development. Even those who don’t have people management responsibilities are often called upon, either by the organization or by an individual, to serve as a mentor to someone who is growing in his or her role. No matter what the circumstances, one thing is clear: when you understand how people think and learn, you can make faster connections and cut through the noise so that you can focus on what really matters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_169"></a>Think about the most effective coaches and mentors you’ve had throughout your career. One of the first things you may have recognized is that they really seem to “get” you, to understand you and know what you care about. Lewis Lubin,<sup><a id="ch11end4a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch11end4">4</a></sup> an executive coach who uses the HBDI in his practice, calls this a process of finding the “chemistry of compatibility.” It’s the homework he does before beginning a coaching engagement so that he can gain some insights into how the person prefers to think and learn. This gives him a starting point for connecting with the individual in an authentic way, drawing in thinking preferences to find a shared comfort zone of language. By speaking from the mindset that connects best, he’s able to ensure that both he and the person he’s coaching are really hearing each other.</p>
<p class="indent">Thinking and learning preferences can also become the springboard for discussions with employees about how they can use their preferences more deliberately, and stretch to other quadrants beyond their preferences to meet specific competency requirements. If their developmental goals require them to be more strategic and holistic in their perspective, for example, how might they use Whole Brain Thinking to move out of their comfort zones and see beyond their blind spots?</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of your thinking and learning preferences, all approaches across the Whole Brain Model are important and valid, which is why the most successful coaches have the thinking agility to move beyond their own comfort zones and filters. As Lewis says, it’s not about being a chameleon or changing who you are; it’s about adapting and being flexible to meet those you coach or your employees where they think (see <a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#ch11fig3">Figure 11-3</a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch11fig3"></a><img src="f0169-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="563" height="246"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 11-3</small></strong> Coaching the Whole Brain way: For best results, coaches must spend time in each of the four thinking quadrants. Here’s a Whole Brain checklist to get you started.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><a id="page_170"></a><strong>The Mentoring Match</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Lynne Krause of BBTD Services<sup><a id="ch11end5a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch11end5">5</a></sup> has a long track record of using the HBDI and thinking preferences as the foundation for matching mentors and mentees. She says that matching people with similar thinking preferences leads to better communication, faster bonding, and increased trust, and the result is longer-lasting and more mutually beneficial mentoring relationships. In one example from the U.S. Naval Command, matching mentors and mentees based on their thinking preferences led to a 99 percent success rate in terms of the pair “sticking” and lasting over time instead of dropping off soon after the first meeting or two, a huge improvement over the previous success rate of just 50 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">Franklin University used the HBDI to accelerate the ramp-up time for its MBA students with their community business leader mentors. Discussing thinking and learning preferences right off the bat allowed them to set the stage so that each party could easily talk about what he or she was seeking and what that person needed most for success. The conversation made it easier and faster for the pairs to get to know each other, which accelerated their ability to use their time most effectively.</p>
<p class="indent">The take-away: if you are seeking out a mentor or coach, or are looking for the opportunity to grow your own skills by becoming a mentor, don’t overlook the importance of thinking and learning preferences.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4a">Everyday Learning with Thinking in Mind</h4>
<p class="noindent">For everyone, especially adults, learning takes energy, focus, and motivation. The way our society works today, there is a general avoidance of discomfort, with a strong desire to make things easier and more convenient. The discomfort created by the need to process new information or change the way you think is often a deterrent. Yet as my friend and HBDI practitioner Manny Elkind,<sup><a id="ch11end6a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch11end6">6</a></sup> president and owner of Mindtech, Inc., once pointed out, “In many cases, if you are not somewhat uncomfortable, then you are probably not learning!”</p>
<p class="indent">In spite of 100 years of dogma saying otherwise, we now know that new neuronal connections can be created, even in the adult brain. Whether you are the learner or you need to help others learn and grow, the research has shown that context, emotional engagement, novelty, meaty challenges, sleep, planning for processing over time, and practice are all essential to making sure that the learning gets through and sticks. When you prepare your brain for learning, <a id="page_171"></a>you will be more mentally prepared for the challenge. You may still not “like” the discomfort that a stretch may require, but you can own the challenge and view learning as a victory.</p>
<p class="indent">And that’s important, because in today’s world, learning isn’t a choice; it’s a necessity if you want to keep up with the pace of change around you. One of the ways you can grow and adapt is to practice accessing and developing your less-preferred modes. The following chart provides a sampling of four types of everyday activities that, through regular practice, will help establish and reinforce a more whole-brained, personal approach to work and life in general. It’s your brain; for best results, use it daily!</p>
<h5 class="h5">A Program for Exercising All Four Quadrants</h5>
<p class="noindent">Building situational capability in each quadrant is like building a muscle; it requires regular practice doing quadrant-specific activities on a consistent basis. In this section, you will find a sampling of everyday activities that, if practiced regularly, will help you establish and reinforce a more whole-brained, personal approach to work and life in general. Modify, adapt, or change the activities as required.</p>
<p class="indent">Select a quadrant that you want to be more proficient in, and either pick one activity a day or repeat one until you feel that you’ve “got it,” then move to another. Overachievers might try to do one from each quadrant every day!</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Do you want to exercise your logical thinking? Your process orientation? How about your kinesthetic or risk-taking abilities? Go to <a class="nounder" href="http://www.wholebrainbusinessbook.com">www.wholebrainbusinessbook.com</a> to download the full seven-day program with plenty of quadrant-specific activities to choose from to build your Whole Brain Thinking muscles.</em></p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidetitlea"><strong>A Quadrant</strong></p>
<p class="sidetitle1"><strong>Finance:</strong></p>
<p class="bullet">• Review your financial status for the current week, the past month, and the year to date.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Download a financial planning app and set it up, then review it weekly.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Calculate how much money you will need in 10 years, and develop a plan to get there.</p>
<p class="sidetitle1"><strong>Goal Focus:</strong></p>
<p class="bullet">• Take a moment to establish or review your personal goals for the month, quarter, and year (a minimum of one, but no more than three). Note these so that you can monitor your progress.</p>
<p class="bullet"><a id="page_172"></a>• Find a goal-setting app that you will actually use, and stay at it for at least a month.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Compare the results of last week’s activities with your objectives for the week. What can you do to be more realistic in your goal setting this week?</p>
<p class="sidetitle"><strong>B Quadrant</strong></p>
<p class="sidetitle1"><strong>Planning:</strong></p>
<p class="bullet">• Plan this week’s priority activities, and schedule them on your calendar with reminders.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Download a new planning app and/or calendar that will work best for you, given your preferences.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Pick a project that you are working on and develop a plan, either starting at the beginning or starting with the end in mind and working backward. Note deadlines, outcomes, and key players.</p>
<p class="sidetitle1"><strong>Timing:</strong></p>
<p class="bullet">• Experience a perfect day of being there on time for every planned activity.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Find a productivity app or use your phone alarm to improve your use of time throughout the day.</p>
<p class="bullet">• For one full week, track how much time it actually takes for you to accomplish tasks, and compare this to your assumptions. Readjust your planning based on realistic time frames.</p>
<p class="sidetitle"><strong>C Quadrant</strong></p>
<p class="sidetitle1"><strong>Empathy:</strong></p>
<p class="bullet">• Show someone who needs empathy that you care by taking the initiative and verbally expressing it in a way that the person will appreciate (for example, send a note, a phone call, an e-mail, a card with a personal message, an invitation to coffee or lunch, or something similar).</p>
<p class="bullet">• Use social media with a focus on listening to better understand others rather than as a forum for posting your own ideas. Pick someone whom you do not know well and read all of his or her posts. What do they say about the person, and what can you learn?</p>
<p class="bullet">• Focus on being intentionally curious about other people all day, asking questions about them, avoiding “I” statements and talking about yourself, and reducing your airtime to well below 40 percent.</p>
<p class="sidetitle1"><a id="page_173"></a><strong>Spirituality:</strong></p>
<p class="bullet">• Discover something about your spiritual self by devoting 15 minutes every day to spiritual reflection.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Try an app or subscribe to a news feed to help you meditate, focus, see daily inspiring quotes, or engage in other activities to help you keep spirituality top of mind.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Spend time exploring spiritual practice by asking a friend about how he or she practices spirituality or reading a book on the topic.</p>
<p class="sidetitle"><strong>D Quadrant</strong></p>
<p class="sidetitle1"><strong>Creative Thinking:</strong></p>
<p class="bullet">• Draw a metaphor of your last vacation or activities you engaged in last week, and have someone else look at it and interpret the meaning.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Search for and download one of the many creativity apps, and use it every time you need to solve a problem.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Take a “theta break” for 20 minutes (take a walk, listen to music, or do something similar), and see what ideas emerge. Be sure to capture them!</p>
<p class="sidetitle1"><strong>Intuitive Ahas:</strong></p>
<p class="bullet">• Make an important decision based entirely on your intuition.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Use a program, recorder, app, or paper notebook to help you capture your intuitive insights easily throughout the day, when exercising, and when you wake up. Make sure to stop and capture them.</p>
<p class="bullet">• Try solving a problem by thinking about it before going to sleep and capturing any intuitive ideas that emerge while you are sleeping or upon waking, even if they are not 100 percent clear yet. Next look for ways you can use that insight to solve the problem.</p>
