<p class="para"><strong><span class="dropcap">S</span></strong>usan had been calling on Dr. Wilburn for seven years now. Although he had always been polite, he wasn’t what you would call warm. Their conversations were strictly business and consistently brief. She knew that many physicians had grown weary of all the calls and visits by pharmaceutical sales reps, but she also knew that her specific drug line would be extremely beneficial for a specific segment of his patient population—if only he would give her the attention and time to understand why. She’d shown him the clinical trial reports, the specifications, and the statistics, but she couldn’t seem to break through.</p>
<p class="indent">One day, as she began to pull up some recent data for him to look at on her new tablet computer, Dr. Wilburn commented on the photo on her screen—a picture of her family on a sailboat.</p>
<p class="indent">“Oh, you like boating? You have to see this, then.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_192"></a>He pulled out a state-of-the-art gadget and scrolled through recent vacation photos of himself and his family out on their boat.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Most people think “selling” is the same as “talking.” But the most effective salespeople know that listening is the most important part of their job.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Roy Bartell</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">“Can you believe how crisp the detail is?” he marveled. “It’s as close as you can get to being there!”</p>
<p class="indent">He confided that new, innovative technology was his secret obsession. He was always upgrading to the latest and greatest “toys,” and he loved experimenting with the new features to see what possibilities there might be for using technology in his practice or for helping him stay connected to his family who lived far away.</p>
<p class="indent">The conversation had finally moved beyond the businesslike formality of the past seven years, but for Susan, there was something even more significant about this exchange. She realized something about Dr. Wilburn’s thinking, and also saw why she’d never been able to break through in all that time.</p>
<p class="indent">“I’d always assumed that because he’s a doctor, his thinking would be very clinical, analytical, and by the book,” she recalled to her manager. “But it turns out, he’s much more conceptual and people-oriented in his thinking. I was talking about cold, hard facts when I should have been talking about possibilities and patient benefits. No wonder he’d been tuning me out.”</p>
<p class="indent">Tiffany McMacken<sup><a id="ch13end1a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch13end1">1</a></sup> of Purdue Pharma says that picking up on these kinds of clues makes all the difference in today’s pharmaceutical sales environment, where it’s not uncommon to get only two or three minutes to spend with a physician, or where there are numerous gatekeepers to get through just to see the decision maker. Understanding how people think helps you not only understand how to “speak their language,” but also determine what will engage their attention, drive their decision-making processes, and influence them—especially when you only have two or three minutes with them!</p>
<p class="indent">At this point, you might be thinking, that’s all very interesting, but I don’t work in sales. I would challenge you to take a closer look at what you do and see if that’s really true. As Dan Pink suggests in his book <em>To Sell Is Human</em>,<sup><a id="ch13end2a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch13end2">2</a></sup> and as numerous others have pointed out as well, no matter what your specific role is, all of our jobs involve selling in one way or another, whether you’re making a pitch, influencing a decision, getting buy-in, selling your ideas, or selling yourself. Building your <a id="page_193"></a>influence, which is so crucial in today’s environment, often means being able to “sell” up, down, across, and outside the organization. There’s a great deal we can learn about connecting and influencing from the best in the sales profession that we can then apply in our own way to be more successful in our own specific responsibilities.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">“The key to successful leadership is influence, not authority.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Ken Blanchard</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Not only has influence become more critical in business, when you consider all the people who may have to weigh in on a decision or be convinced of your idea or its value, but your “customer” base has gotten larger, more diverse, and more distracted. Forget the Golden Rule. To get to the “yes” quickly, you have to apply what Dr. Tony Alessandra calls the <em>Platinum Rule</em><sup><a id="ch13end3a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch13end3">3</a></sup>: treating others the way <em>they</em> want to be treated. Thinking preferences provide the clues to get you there faster and on point.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Overcoming Resistance and Skepticism</h4>
<p class="noindent">Do you remember the last time you were being pitched by someone who really didn’t “get you”? Our tolerance for such a mismatch as receivers is very low, yet it happens more often than not when <em>we ourselves</em> are trying to influence <em>others</em>. It might happen when you’re trying to influence your boss or spouse to take action, or when you’re working with a colleague who just doesn’t see things your way. Maybe you’re attempting to teach your child a new skill or are in the middle of a presentation to a tough audience. Progress is slowed or even stopped completely simply because your audience is hearing or viewing the messages through a thinking lens that’s very different from the one you’re presenting through.</p>
<p class="indent">HBDI master facilitator Chuck McVinney<sup><a id="ch13end4a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch13end4">4</a></sup> delivers a program called “Faculty Leadership for Scientists and Engineers” with Charles Leiserson, a professor of computer science and artificial intelligence at MIT. They’ve conducted this program, which incorporates Whole Brain Thinking into leadership development, with faculty members at numerous major universities, including the MIT School of Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University School of Engineering and Computer Science, UC Berkeley School of Science and Engineering, Harvard University Division of Computer Sciences, and the National University of Singapore.</p>
<p class="indent">As with many presentations delivered before a group, the kickoff is very important because it’s all about getting buy-in. If you don’t have that to begin with, you’ve lost your audience for the rest of the program. So that first introduction of the Whole Brain Model in this program is, at its core, like a sales pitch; whether or not the faculty members “buy it” depends on how aligned their thinking is with the mentality behind how it’s presented.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_194"></a><a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#ch13fig1">Figure 13-1</a> shows a highly visual representation of the model as a metaphor for how the brain works. For many people, this message resonates instantly. The colorful, image-filled depiction of the different thinking styles makes the concepts clear to them. They get it, they accept it, and they’re ready to move on.</p>

<p class="centers">Nobody counts the number of ads you run; they just remember the impression you make.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—William Bernbach</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">For the strong A-quadrant thinkers who make up the science and engineering faculty in Chuck’s leadership sessions, however, it’s a different story. He found that they would see this image and start analyzing and interpreting it in a completely different way. Even though the model is a metaphor, they <a id="page_195"></a>were viewing it from their own literal, analytical perspective, and the walls went up. They simply weren’t going to accept this conceptual framework on its face.</p>
<p class="indent">Chuck and Charles realized that they needed to essentially “sell” the model in the way this audience would best understand it and buy into it. That’s when they came up with a new visual to introduce it (see <a class="nounder" href="ch13.html#ch13fig2">Figure 13-2</a>). Note the description: the A-quadrant nature of it matches the thinking preferences of their audience. Since they changed the presentation, the difference in response and buy-in has been dramatic. The faculty members accept it and move on.</p>

<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>Marketing, Advertising, and Thinking Preferences</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Studies of magazine ads that I have conducted reveal that those ads run the gamut of mental options for each quadrant and each mode of the Whole Brain Model. The studies also show that ads tend to cluster in terms of style, format, and location based on the product or service being advertised. For example, ads dealing with financial investments are almost always black and white, very straightforward, crowded with numbers and percentages, and generally located in the first few pages of a magazine like <em>Forbes</em> or <em>Bloomberg Businessweek,</em> or clearly depicted on websites. Ads and sites for vacations are dramatically different. These are almost always four-color, with exotic scenes provocatively displayed, or with hot-air balloons or sunsets in the background. Family healthcare ads and websites are often soft-focus photos of caring parents and smiling children, designed to <a id="page_196"></a>pull at our heartstrings. Automobile ads, particularly those in automobile magazines, are often multiple-page foldouts in full color, ranging across all four quadrants in order to appeal to every potential facet of a prospective buyer’s fantasies. Automobile websites frequently feature videos, clickable feature charts and technical specs, testimonials, and gorgeous photography.</p>
<p class="indent">In television advertising and online videos, there are numerous examples as well, such as the classic “Mac vs. PC” commercials. In one ad, the Mac explains that he’s “into doing fun stuff, like movies, music, podcasts, stuff like that,” while the PC responds that he, too, likes fun stuff, “like timesheets, spreadsheets, and pie charts.” The PC is described as a “wizard at numbers,” who wants to help people “balance their checkbooks,” while the Mac is good at “creating stuff” and “stimulating imagination.”</p>
<p class="indent">These ads are prepared by professionals who have diagnosed the market with costly research, including special interviews and focus groups. The objective is to align the product with the market segment that is likely to purchase it. On the average, this seems to work. But my feeling is that advertising agencies frequently fall far short of their goal because they do not take the rather predictable mental preferences of the target population into account. I believe the same is true of marketing and sales departments, of manufacturers, and of service deliverers. While the entirely new field of neuromarketing has arisen to attempt to capture and study consumers’ sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective response to marketing stimuli, the solution doesn’t have to be that complex. Whole Brain Thinking provides a much more straightforward approach for understanding the mentality of the product, then matching it with that of the target audience we’re trying to reach—and then aligning the marketing, advertising, and sales approach to seal the deal.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4a">Connecting with Your Customer</h4>
<p class="noindent">Developing products with customers in mind takes the idea of Whole Brain design to a new level. A lot of organizations talk about being customer-focused and customer-centric, but Microsoft,<sup><a id="ch13end5a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch13end5">5</a></sup> with the launch of its Kinect peripheral for Xbox 360, did a fantastic job of really looking at who its customer was, and in the process was able to actually improve its design and development approach.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_197"></a>To showcase Kinect’s features, the development team at Microsoft Game Studios’ Good Science Studio was given the task of making sure that the series of games that shipped with the new peripheral would appeal to the whole family, not just the typical “gamer.” Recognizing from our data that the world is a composite Whole Brain, the team members used the Whole Brain Model as a foundational design principle and designed games that appealed to all of the different thinking preferences. Thinking preferences were factored into the game features, the user testing phases, and even as they looked at the makeup of their own team. According to the design team, the benchmark testing they conducted after the game’s release confirmed that the Whole Brain design approach had paid off: the most whole-brained game proved to be the most popular.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">It is not your customer’s job to remember you. It is your obligation and responsibility to make sure they don’t have the chance to forget you.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Patricia Fripp</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Another company that puts thinking at the heart of its customer approach is Telecom New Zealand.<sup><a id="ch13end6a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch13end6">6</a></sup> How often have you called a customer service number and been totally frustrated by the response and attention you received? Maybe you had to call back again and again to get a satisfactory resolution to your problem. This isn’t just annoying for you; it’s wasting time and money for the company—and probably damaging its reputation. Telecom New Zealand wanted to get out in front of this issue. To reduce repeat calls to its call centers and increase customer satisfaction rates, the company implemented Whole Brain Thinking training for its call center representatives to help them pick up clues about their customers’ thinking preferences so that they could tailor their responses in the most effective way for that person. This meant moving away from a canned script to a more adaptive style, but as the company has discovered, it has ultimately made the call center representatives more efficient. Whereas some customers may have felt rushed and others shortchanged in the past, now all customers spend the “right” amount of time with a representative.</p>
<p class="indent">The results have been quantifiable in a number of different ways: the company has experienced a dramatic improvement in postcall surveys, including team customer satisfaction ratings of 4 out of 4, increased dials-to-calls-completed, and improved sales results. In fact, it saw satisfaction scores increase within weeks of undertaking the program, and according to the company’s independent auditors, for every $1 it invested in the Whole Brain Thinking program during the first year of the initiative, it made $12 in return. That’s what <a id="page_198"></a>I would call a significant Return on Intelligence (ROI®)!</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">“A mediocre idea that generates enthusiasm will go further than a great idea that inspires no one.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Mary Kay Ash</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Depending on your role, your customer might be a broad consumer audience, like Microsoft’s, or an individual on the other end of the phone, like Telecom New Zealand’s. It could be a client that you’ve been trying to make headway with or a colleague in another department. Maybe you need to get buy-in from your boss or rally the team behind your vision. No matter whom you are trying to influence, when you’re able to “meet them where they think,” you’ll be more efficient, and you’ll have a better chance of getting the response you’re looking for.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle1"><strong>Put It to Work</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Whether you’re designing a product, a presentation, a website, or an advertisement, or simply preparing for a one-on-one conversation, stop for a minute and think about your customer.</p>
<p class="indentbt">Consider an idea that you have or have had in the past and how you might best pitch it based on who the customer or audience is:</p>
<p class="bullet">• What information does that person need in order to make the decision or resolve the problem?</p>
<p class="bullet">• How can you present the information in a way that will satisfy his or her needs?</p>
<p class="bullet">• What strategy should you use to influence or shift his or her thinking?</p>
<p class="indenti">Here are four examples of customers you might encounter. How would you prepare for each?</p>
<p class="sidetitle"><strong>A. “Just Give Me the Facts”</strong></p>
<p class="noindentb1">Customers with a strong A-quadrant preference are looking for the facts, not the fluff. They prefer:</p>
<p class="bullet">• Technical accuracy</p>
<p class="bullet">• Well-articulated ideas</p>
<p class="bullet">• Data and fact-based charts</p>
<p class="bullet">• Brief, clear, precise information</p>
<p class="indenti">They often use a more formal approach and may have already done some research, so they’re expecting you to know your stuff. Look for clues to that formality, and be prepared to respond with data to back up your statements. <a id="page_199"></a>Be succinct and precise, to the point and brief. The bottom line: don’t waste their time. <em>How would you position your idea for this audience?</em></p>
<p class="sidetitle"><strong>B. “What’s the Plan?”</strong></p>
<p class="noindentb1">Then there are those with a preference for B-quadrant thinking who want plenty of detail. They prefer things like:</p>
<p class="bullet">• Thorough information with references</p>
<p class="bullet">• Timelines and procedures</p>
<p class="bullet">• Concise, step-by-step approaches</p>
<p class="bullet">• Reliability and follow-through</p>
<p class="indenti">They are usually looking for a clear, linear walkthrough of the information. And because they’re typically very organized, you need to present yourself that way, too. These customers want to know: What happens next? How will that happen? What are the timelines? Reliability is important. Make sure your response is timely, thorough, and accurate. <em>How would you position your idea for this audience?</em></p>
<p class="sidetitle"><strong>C. “Show Me You Care About Me”</strong></p>
<p class="noindentb1">People who have strong C-quadrant preferences really want to engage with you. They prefer:</p>
<p class="bullet">• Open, informal discussion</p>
<p class="bullet">• Expressive body and voice</p>
<p class="bullet">• Introductions and conversation</p>
<p class="bullet">• Authenticity—no hidden agendas</p>
<p class="indenti">They’re looking for genuine interest. Because they’re usually very expressive, you can pick up from their gestures and their animated expressions that they are looking to connect with you. Canned questions and generic, scripted interactions won’t cut it. Make eye contact, engage them with people-centered examples, and look for ways to make a personal connection. <em>How would you position your idea for this audience?</em></p>
<p class="sidetitle"><strong>D. “What Are the Possibilities?”</strong></p>
<p class="noindentb1">The D-quadrant thinkers want the big picture. They prefer:</p>
<p class="bullet">• Minimal details</p>
<p class="bullet">• Metaphors and visuals</p>
<p class="bullet">• Conceptual frameworks</p>
<p class="bullet">• Freedom to explore</p>
<p class="indenti">Unlike B-quadrant thinkers, these customers don’t want to get bogged down in the details. Be sure to include the big picture and the “why” <a id="page_200"></a>behind your idea. They’re often looking for creative options, so find opportunities to be flexible where you can, and have possible alternatives to the standard approach ready. Because they tend to use picture words in their interactions, one effective way to get your point across is to use metaphors that artfully describe what you’re talking about. <em>How would you position your idea for this audience?</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indentb">When preparing for any important discussion or presentation, follow these Whole Brain steps to cover each quadrant for best results:</p>
<p class="numberlist2">1. First, give context to clarify very early on why you are there: What it is that you want to get across and why? What’s the big picture? Why does this matter? Without context, your messages can be misunderstood or even ignored. (D)</p>
<p class="numberlist2">2. Have an agenda or outline in mind, even if it’s brief, to let the person or people know where you’re going and what to expect—and then stick to it. In addition to helping you stay on point and demonstrate a clear purpose, this step will ensure that you hit on everything you set out to address. (B)</p>
<p class="numberlist2">3. Present the key data and facts that back up your intention. Now that you’ve set up the context and the agenda, you can dive into the content. Your “customer” will have the clarity and perspective to view it through the appropriate lens and hear it the way you meant it. Be prepared with the necessary knowledge to ensure credibility. (A)</p>
<p class="numberlist2">4. Engage with interactions and relevant stories, make great eye contact, and listen. Our brains are always looking for connections. By facilitating this process and helping your customer make the connections throughout, you’ll have better impact, and the messages will “stick.” (C)</p>
<p class="title"><strong>SO WHAT?</strong></p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  No matter what your role is, an essential part of your job is to sell, influence, or gain buy-in in some form or fashion.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  By understanding how those you seek to influence think, whether they are your customers, colleagues, boss, or family members, you can get to the root of how they make decisions and, as a result, influence them in a faster, more positive way.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  The Whole Brain approach, through its diagnostic power and design direction, offers a practical framework for improving presentation, product, and service design as well as other customer-facing activities.</p>
