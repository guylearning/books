<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  High productivity is based on the combination of individuals being stimulated by particular work, being aligned with that work in their jobs, and addressing any remaining blind spots.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Understanding the mental preferences of individuals and the mental requirements of the work they do is a critical management skill and priority in order to achieve maximum effectiveness on the job.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  In most roles, “fit” really means a combination of alignment with existing skills, challenges and skill building for continued growth, and having the tools and strategies to situationally address the areas that are required for the job but are outside the person’s comfort zone.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Thinking preferences also affect which workflow and productivity strategies will be most effective for the individual.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Using a Whole Brain approach to align individuals with their work and providing productivity tools that are aligned with their thinking preferences results in significant increases in productivity.</p>
<p class="para"><strong><span class="dropcap">F</span></strong>or as long as he could remember, Sean had wanted to work in advertising. When he landed an account executive position at a top firm, he was thrilled. It wasn’t long, however, before his outlook changed.</p>
<p class="indent">A creative thinker with a big imagination and an even bigger dislike of details and structure, Sean was struggling to find satisfaction in his new role. While he enjoyed talking to the clients and the creatives about plans and ideas, the majority of his time was spent researching information about clients and their products, preparing proposals and progress reports, and trying to keep track of budgets and timelines. His boss was constantly on him about his record keeping and invoicing, and overall, he was floundering. It seemed to take all of his energy and then some to get his work done.</p>
<p class="indent">Sean couldn’t understand it. Here he was, finally in his dream job, but he was unhappy, frustrated, and bored, and probably on the verge of being fired.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_150"></a>His manager didn’t get it either. Sean had drive, enthusiasm, and impressive credentials. When she’d brought him on board, she’d thought he had all the makings of a hotshot ad executive, but he was barely getting by. The human resources director suggested that Sean complete the HBDI assessment to see if it would reveal any clues as to what was going on.</p>
<p class="indent">Looking at his profile results, they discovered that Sean‘s preferences were strongly in the D quadrant. Not only that, but he had a low preference, actually an avoidance, for detail-oriented, B-quadrant work. No wonder he was struggling. When it came to the majority of the work he was expected to perform, it was a total mental mismatch.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">In business, respect for the individual means acknowledging that every individual wants to do good work and to contribute to the success of the organization.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Kashavan Nair</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The firm’s managers didn’t want to lose Sean. They saw his potential, and when they found the opportunity to move him into a position in Creative where he was not only more energized and satisfied with his work, he excelled. In fact, his very first campaign won the firm a national advertising award.</p>
<p class="indent">Did this shift mean that Sean no longer had to deal with details? Budgets? Follow-up? No! But he was able to find the motivation and energy to deal with those tasks now that it was all in service of work that he clearly loved. It made all the difference.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Engagement, Productivity, and Job Fit</h4>
<p class="noindent">People gravitate toward occupations that allow them to exercise their preferred modes of knowing. That’s why we can develop HBDI occupational categories that contain “typical” profiles for certain kinds of jobs. But once employees occupy jobs—specific positions in specific organizations—they often find themselves dealing with a workload that demands they spend large blocks of time, possibly even a majority, operating in areas of lesser preference or even avoidance.</p>
<p class="indent">Such mental mismatches, persisting over the years, sharply increase stress and anxiety, which can and do raise not only the incidence of flu, colds, and absenteeism, but also that of heart attacks, nervous breakdowns, alcoholism, and substance abuse. Even when their motivation to do a job well is high, people who are mentally mismatched find it difficult to keep up with the job’s demands, and they must often work extra hours to accomplish what others can <a id="page_151"></a>do in less time. It can become not just a work burden but a personal and family one as well.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">People do not get tired out from working where work is intelligently handled. Work, if it is interesting, is a stimulant. It’s worry and a lack of interest in what one does that tire and discourage. Every one of us should have our pet interests—as many as we can handle efficiently and happily. Our interests should never be allowed to lag or get cold so that all enthusiasm is spent. Each day can be one of triumph if you keep up your interests—feeding them as they feed you.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—George Matthew Adams</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Sound overdramatic? Consider the number of employees who leave their jobs or are actively looking for new ones every year, in both bad and good economic times. Engagement data from Gallup show that only 30 percent of employees are actively engaged, and disengagement rates are increasing at an alarming pace as the “do more with less” mentality has piled on more responsibilities and tasks, whether or not they have anything to do with what the person does best. The impact isn’t just on the individual; the organization also loses out in multiple ways. The most obvious is the lost productivity and discretionary effort of those who are doing just what they have to do in order to get by. Actively disengaged employees can also have a negative influence on other employees and push customers away. Turnover, quality, safety, profitability … the list of costs goes on and on.</p>
<p class="indent">As I touched upon in <a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a>, I believe that engagement, and thus individual and organizational productivity, starts with a combination of people being stimulated by a particular kind of work and being aligned with that work in their job. By stimulated, I mean having work that is so interesting to them that if they had the opportunity to choose, they would select it for its inspiration and pleasure because the performance of it is rewarding in itself. This work is not necessarily the easiest—it is often the most challenging, but in a way that the individual finds inherently satisfying, Desire for this type of work is at the top of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs;<sup><a id="ch10end1a"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch10end1">1</a></sup> it’s called self-actualization. The opportunity to perform stimulating work is a major ingredient of motivation, since motivation always comes from within a person. Allowing people access to work that stimulates them pulls them into performing at their highest level of work performance. Just think of the kind of productivity, <a id="page_152"></a>satisfaction, and fulfillment that both the individuals and their managers will enjoy as a result.</p>
<h4 class="h4">Making a Match</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the advantages of the Whole Brain System is the capability of diagnosing the mental requirements for work. Using the Whole Brain Model as a diagnostic tool provides management with a way of diagnosing the mentality of the work elements that make up a job assignment. A job can be thought of as an aggregate of tasks composed of work elements. Each work element can be diagnosed in terms of the mentality required to perform it. This means that it is possible to profile and even design the total job on the basis of the distribution of mental requirements needed to perform that job at an optimum level. For example, analytic work elements, such as analyzing the information in a financial report, are A-quadrant in their mentality. Detailed administrative work elements, such as filling out and processing applications and forms, are B-quadrant in their mentality. Interpersonal-type work elements, such as contacting a customer, are C-quadrant in their mentality. And work elements that require strategic thinking, such as brainstorming on a more effective way to beat the competition or innovating products, are D-quadrant in their mentality. Once a pro forma profile of the job is complete, it can be compared to the individual’s mental preferences, and the degree of alignment can easily be determined.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at an example of an employee’s HBDI Profile compared to pro forma profiles of a range of jobs, from fully aligned to totally nonaligned (see <a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#ch10fig1">Figure 10-1</a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch10fig1"></a><img src="f0153-01.jpg" alt="Images" width="676" height="904"/></p>
<p class="figcap"><strong><small>FIGURE 10-1</small></strong> An employee’s HBDI Profile compared with HBDI pro-forma profiles of jobs ranging from aligned to nonaligned with the employee’s preferences.</p>
<p class="indent">It is easy to come to the conclusion that when the employee’s mental preferences are in alignment with the job’s mental requirements, everybody wins. The better the alignment, the higher the productivity potential. When the managerial climate is supportive of the alignment initiative, higher productivity is more likely.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">Every job is a self-portrait of the person who did it.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Unknown</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">When working with business audiences, I sometimes ask them to pick a percentage figure describing their own productivity, then write down this private information on a piece of paper and stick it in a pocket. Later on, after talking about the business applications of my work and the opportunity to design jobs and assign people to those jobs, I ask them to write on another piece of paper what their productivity could be if their work offered them the opportunity to be inspired and stimulated, and to put this piece of paper in another pocket. At the end of the day, just before <a id="page_153"></a>the session ends, I’ll say, “Oh, incidentally, what are you going to do about those two pieces of paper in your pocket?” People volunteer that the difference between the two numbers ranges from 10 to 50 percent—with the higher number always being on that second piece of paper.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_154"></a>Based on this and other observations, I believe the potential productivity gain in the average business group is 30 percent. To check this out, just look inward. What would a perfect job match do to your productivity? What would stimulating work do to your job satisfaction?</p>
<h4 class="h4">When Mental Mismatches Can’t (or Shouldn’t) Be Avoided</h4>
<p class="noindent">As Sean’s story and my experience with business audiences show, a high degree of alignment between the individual’s preferences and the thinking demands of the job is the ideal situation. But it’s not always possible or practical to reassign people or completely redesign jobs. The key is understanding how the person’s preferences line up with the job, then helping the individual find ways to be as effective as possible regardless. While some degree of alignment is important, the reality is that all of us work outside our zones of preference to some extent every day. But we can find ways to adjust the work to fit our mental preferences and competencies.</p>
<p class="indent">From a managerial standpoint, the first step is realizing that this person has a potential blind spot and taking steps to help him or her address it through such support as job aids, training, or coaching. The manager also needs to recognize the degree of energy, self-motivation, and passion that will be required if the employee has a lack of preference or an avoidance for particular aspects of the job. Quite often, the employees themselves have ideas about how to better perform the work based on how they prefer to think. Managers should encourage employees to take the initiative to make changes in the way the work is performed as long as the necessary outcomes are achieved. The productivity and work satisfaction gains can be enormous.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>Thinking Preferences and How You Manage Your Productivity</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">In today’s business world, where the large majority of work is knowledge work, each day can be different and challenging in its own way. Constant change means that most of us are dealing with simultaneous projects, shifting priorities, complex new problems, demands from people both inside and outside the organization, and a never-ending stream of interruptions. Managing your time effectively and staying productive is essential to getting the job done, but it can also feel like a constant battle.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_155"></a>Even though there are more productivity apps and tools available now than ever before, you may still be struggling. In fact, they could be making you feel more overwhelmed. That’s because your thinking preferences affect the way you manage deadlines, tasks, projects, and even how you view time. As a result, the time and project management tools and techniques that work so well for someone else could be frustrating and distracting for you. The key is to understand how your thinking preferences affect your approach to work. Then you can find tools that align with your thinking instead of adding to your mental burden.</p>
<p class="indent">Your preferences will create both challenges and opportunities when it comes to your productivity. Once you have a better understanding of these, you can take advantage of the benefits of your preferences and avoid getting tripped up by the downsides. It’s about managing your thinking rather than letting it manage you.</p>
<p class="indent">Here are some of the advantages, challenges, and opportunities of each quadrant when it comes to managing productivity, time, tasks, and projects:</p>
<p class="sidetitle"><strong>A Quadrant</strong></p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Advantage: Goal orientation.</strong> Focused on achieving results. Often skilled at using technology tools and systems to manage time effectively.</p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Challenge: Analysis overkill.</strong> May be so focused on the need for data or facts that analysis can take time and get off track. Focus on the bottom line may mean overlooking the big picture and other people’s feelings and needs for coordination.</p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Opportunity: Technology.</strong> Use technology to set up a system that is efficient and effective and also makes it easy for others to schedule and know what’s going on without requiring a lot of interaction.</p>
<p class="sidetitle"><strong>B Quadrant</strong></p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Advantage: Task orientation.</strong> Organized and focused on getting things done. May naturally put processes in place to manage time well.</p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Challenge: Getting bogged down.</strong> May like to do things the way they have been done before and resist change. Desire for closure may create stress. Also may get caught up in details and miss the big picture.</p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Opportunity: Tactical planning.</strong> Use a linear, practical system to create a structure that they can maintain, aiding in future planning as well as today’s needs. Plan in buffer time for changes so that they create less stress.</p>
<p class="sidetitle"><a id="page_156"></a><strong>C Quadrant</strong></p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Advantage: People orientation.</strong> Sensitivity to others’ needs allows for coordination and thoughtful planning. Good communication. Motivated to stay on track so that others’ needs are met.</p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Challenge: Overcommitment.</strong> May say “yes” to too many commitments due to unrealistic view of timing and wanting to avoid conflict, creating stress and planning challenges.</p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Opportunity: Communication.</strong> Use people skills to graciously defer, delegate, or decline. Ask others for realistic time perspective. Find a system that is comfortable, engaging, and colorful to check on availability and stay on track.</p>
<p class="sidetitle"><strong>D Quadrant</strong></p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Advantage: Big-picture orientation.</strong> Often sees ways to be creative at getting things done in spite of challenges, adapting to the changing situation to make it work.</p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Challenge: Focus.</strong> May suffer from a lack of detail orientation combined with a desire to do it all, leading to overbooking and many delays in previously scheduled items due to time running over and unrealistic timeframes.</p>
<p class="sidehanging"><strong>Opportunity: Getting creative.</strong> Find a new, visual system and/or device that makes time, task, and project management more fun and accessible and makes detail capture and follow-up easier.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">And what about those times when you <em>want</em> to put someone in a stretch mode? Many new leader and high-potential development programs include job rotation assignments that intentionally move people around so they can benefit from the exposure to work that specifically isn’t in their sweet spots. The idea is to broaden the person’s thinking so that he or she can become a more well-rounded leader, but the key here is stretch, not flip-flop. If the assignment requires the person to stretch while still honoring enough of his or her preferences, there is opportunity for growth. If it’s entirely within an area of very low preference or avoidance, there is a good chance for frustration and discouragement, which will be easier to bear only if the individual is highly motivated to learn and knows that this is only temporary.</p>
<p class="indent">When the goal is to stretch, first ask, is the person motivated? It will take a good amount of motivation and energy to be successful. Second, take the <a id="page_157"></a>person’s strengths and blind spots into account as you coach him or her to handle the responsibilities.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebartitle"><strong>Put It to Work</strong></p>
<p class="noindentb">Think about an opportunity or career progression you’re interested in that will require you to stretch:</p>
<p class="bullet">• What specific mental demands will be misaligned with your preferences?</p>
<p class="bullet">• What is your usual reaction to this kind of work?</p>
<p class="bullet">• How can you use your areas of stronger preference to build your inner self-motivation?</p>
<p class="bullet">• What else should you watch out for?</p>
<p class="bulletb">• Who could you go to for help to widen your perspective and see past your mental “blind spots”?</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">I think it is an immutable law in business that words are words, explanations are explanations, promises are promises—but only performance is reality.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Harold Geneen</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now try this exercise thinking about a colleague you know well or a direct report who needs to stretch in order to grow. How could you be a resource to that person in the process?</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4a">How to Turn Misalignment Around</h4>
<p class="noindent">My advice is to try assessing the work and those doing it in a small work group where job design issues and job assignment practices are sufficiently flexible to accommodate such a demonstration. In our company, we often pull in employees from different departments to get a good mix of mental preferences for a project. Sometimes a finite project will reveal preferences for work and competencies much more visibly, especially if the team leader is there to witness this in action. The following tips can help you get started. If you aren’t in a managerial position, talk to your manager or supervisor and team up with the human resources department to problem-solve your misalignment issues.</p>
<div class="sidebarb">
<p class="centers">Every calling is great when greatly pursued.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_158"></a><em>Design tasks, projects, and jobs with mental preferences in mind:</em></p>
<p class="bulletlist"><span class="gray">•</span> Analyze the work elements of tasks, projects, and jobs according to the quadrant they call for.</p>
<p class="bulletlist"><span class="gray">•</span> Set priorities to identify the most important, primary elements required and the percentage time allocation for each, so you can make sure that the bulk of the time the person spends involves activities that call on the same mental modes as the most important work.</p>
<p class="bulletlist"><span class="gray">•</span> Refrain from casually or inadvertently adding responsibilities to that position—even for administrative convenience—for any significant or undefined period of time if they unbalance the mental shift of the job, that is, shift it away from the quadrant required to achieve the purpose at hand, unless you have no other choice or the individual seeks to develop and is highly motivated to do so.</p>
<p class="indentbs"><em>Encourage work and preference matching on an ongoing basis:</em></p>
<p class="bulletlist"><span class="gray">•</span> Educate employees at all levels about how their thinking preferences relate to their productivity, effectiveness, and satisfaction.</p>

<p class="bulletlist"><span class="gray">•</span> Provide productivity tools that align with the person’s thinking preferences, or give the person freedom to select the tools that work best for him or her.</p>
<p class="bulletlist"><span class="gray">•</span> Address any blind spots that come from areas of low preference by providing training, support, and other tools and, wherever possible, ensuring that the employee sees these activities as necessary to pursue in the service of successfully achieving his or her preferred work.</p>
<p class="bulletlist"><span class="gray">•</span> Measure the resulting productivity gains.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="centers">There is a time when misalignment might actually be a good thing. Early in one’s career, misalignment can be a gift that helps a growing employee get clear about what their fit really is, as long as it does not derail their career in the process and they have other options to pursue.</p>
<p class="att"><strong>—Ann Herrmann-Nehdi</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Most work—even physical labor—is largely mental. It stands to reason, then, that we will be most productive if we are doing work that calls for the <a id="page_159"></a>mental modes we most strongly prefer. But there will also be some degree of stretch in any job; this is never an excuse for poor performance. It’s up to managers to help people use their preferences in the service of the work that needs to be done, and it’s up to the individual to take the initiative on his or her own behalf. When there is enough alignment in place, and the individual is motivated to develop enough skills to address the inevitable stretch requirements, the possibilities for productivity improvement are significant, providing the organization with an important competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="title"><strong>SO WHAT?</strong></p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  All too frequently, jobs are assembled without regard for the mental requirements it takes to perform them, and employees are placed in those jobs without regard for their mental preferences and the need for alignment.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Nonalignment of employees with their work leads to poor performance, low productivity, and low job satisfaction.</p>
<p class="arrow"><img class="inline" src="arrow.jpg" alt="Images" width="10" height="11"/>  Every job requires some degree of stretch; it’s up to the manager to recognize and coach employees who are in stretch mode, and it’s up to the employees to take the initiative to use their preferences in service of the work that needs to be done and seek the necessary development to adequately address those areas of lesser preference.<a id="page_160"></a></p>
