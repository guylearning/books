<p>An Internet site, or website, remains first and foremost an information medium or a showcase. It is a good means of identification and communication. As a result, it can be beneficial for web designers to study in detail how this kind of application is implemented and not to approach it like a conventional project, since it involves providing various users with different tastes and preferences, access to a mass of structured and coherent information. This condition requires particular interest to be placed in this medium, with regard to both content and presentation.</p>

<h2 id="sec4-1"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1. Process of creating a website</span></h2>
<p>The process of creating a website is not only limited to the technical phase (<i>development of web pages</i>). It also needs to be planned using a structured and creative approach: the definition of a certain number of steps, ideas and solutions to problems.</p>
<p>The steps for creating a website can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>– development;</li>
<li>– hosting;</li>
<li>– referencing;</li>
<li>– updating.</li></ul>
<section>
<h3 id="sec4-1-1"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.1. <i>Development</i></span></h3>
<p>The development phase essentially covers the following steps.</p>
<section>
<h4 id="sec4-1-1-1"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.1.1. <i>Preliminary study</i></span></h4>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="168" id="page_168"></span>A website generally needs to satisfy a need and not simply a desire, to the point that in this phase the designer is required to set the list of objectives, select the orientations and estimate the feasibility of the site.</p>
<p>The preliminary study leads to a global reflection about the website realized: it focuses first on the objectives of the site (<i>company site</i>, <i>sources of information</i>, <i>portal</i>, <i>online commerce</i>, etc.) and the target audience (<i>group of friends</i>, <i>clients</i>, etc.). Second, on the logistical means offered (<i>development tools</i>, <i>performance and duration of connections</i>, etc.) and the implementation budget.</p>
<p>It is during this step that the idea of creating the website will be taken up or canceled.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 id="sec4-1-1-2"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.1.2. <i>Specifications</i></span></h4>
<p>The specifications document presents a set of information regarding the characteristics of the website to be created (theme of the site, objectives, the supervisor, the creator(s), the hardware and software requirements, the time frame for design and implementation, the requirements regarding work quality and quantity, the form of the end product and the evaluation rules).</p>
<p>The specifications will play the role of a reference document for the steps that follow the website development phase.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 id="sec4-1-1-3"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.1.3. <i>Design of the structure of the site and content of web pages (preparation of a storyboard)</i></span></h4>
<p>As soon as the specifications have been put in place, it is worth specifying the structure of the site, i.e. how to organize the information to be presented. An overview of the possible techniques for moving around within the website structure also needs to be specified. Therefore, for each link, it is important to define all the possible effects that could be perceived by the user as well as the direction of navigation (<i>back</i>, <i>forward</i>) and the type to be put in place (<i>menu</i>, <i>standard button</i>, <i>image</i>, etc.).</p>
<p>In this phase, it is possible to simply use paper and a pencil to draw frames to represent the web pages of the site and arrows to designate the links while defining the content of each of these pages (<i>information</i>, <i>buttons</i>, <i>links</i> and <i>images</i>). Throughout this exercise, the designer must keep in mind the purpose of the site and the target audience.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="169" id="page_169"></span>Several templates exist for organizing the pages of a website.</p>

<section>
<h5><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.1.3.1. Linear architecture or sequential architecture</span></h5>
<p>This is the term used for a site formed by a set of pages structured sequentially, i.e. the first page (home page) refers to the second, and the second refers to the third and so on. This structure is essentially a characteristic of older websites. It is not very interactive and favors narrativity and browsing.</p>
<p>Application types: learning sites or tutorials, slide show, comic strip.</p>

</section>
<section>
<h5><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.1.3.2. Hierarchical architecture</span></h5>
<p>This is the term for a site that generally consists of a home page leading the user to other pages. Each of these pages will direct the user to a set of pages formed by links that refer to that page. Sequential architecture represents a special case of hierarchical architecture.</p>
<p>This way of organizing information into independent, hierarchical blocks requires fairly substantial work in terms of prior analysis of the site content, as this kind of architecture will only be effective if the available information is carefully organized.</p>

</section>
<section>
<h5><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.1.3.3. Composite architecture (non-hierarchical)</span></h5>
<p>This is the structure most commonly used for current websites. The user can reach the different levels of the site starting from the home page, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Type of application: the permanent menu bar.</p>
<figure>

<p>NOTE.– Drawing a structure for your website and preparing the storyboard saves time during the development phase.</p>

<h4 id="sec4-1-1-4"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.1.4. <i>Technical development</i></span></h4>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="171" id="page_171"></span>This step consists of:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>– data collection: this involves preparing the objects necessary for integration into the site (<i>text</i>, <i>images</i>, <i>sounds</i> and <i>videos</i>). This operation consists of collecting these objects from various sources or creating them using the appropriate hardware and software tools. Of course, it can be beneficial to organize these objects in different directories in order to facilitate the following step:</li><li>
– integration: this involves collecting the objects prepared during the collection phase, whilst adhering to the storyboard of the site already planned. This step also covers the web page development, testing and remediation phases. Therefore, it is important to have a local browser to test the display of all components of the site.

<section>
<h4 id="sec4-1-2-1"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.2.1. <i>Definition</i></span></h4>
<p>This step consists of making an Internet site accessible from the Web. It therefore involves copying all the files from the site to the disk of a server (powerful computer) that is, in general, permanently connected to the Internet network.</p>
<p>To implement this process, first of all it is necessary to obtain a domain name. This is an internationally unique site identifier. It is the name that the user will enter into the browser address bar.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="172" id="page_172"></span>

<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>
</section>
</aside>
<p>After the domain name is reserved, the site must be stored on the hosting server disk and then the home page will be associated with the domain name already chosen: the home page files are named index.htm, index.html, default.htm or default.html. These files must be named in this way so that the server knows which file to automatically direct individuals wishing to access a website address (URL).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE.–</p>
<p>If the user types the following address: <a href="http://www.mes.tn">http://www.mes.tn</a>, the server will automatically direct the user to the home page as follows: <a href="http://mes.tn/index.html">http://mes.tn/index.html</a>.</p>

<h4 id="sec4-1-2-2"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.2.2. <i>Hosting types</i></span></h4>
<p>On the Web, various hosting formulas exist. Below are some examples:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>– Multi-tenant hosting: this is one of the cheapest hosting formulas, consisting of sharing a server's storage space between several websites, hence the name “multi-tenant hosting”. Choosing this option means that the hosting service is responsible for ensuring and verifying the smooth operation of the site at all times. For this type of choice, the customer is invited only to register with the Web hosting service, who will handle all ensuing tasks.</li>
<li>– Dedicated web hosting: this is a type of hosting that consists of reserving an entire web server for exclusive use. It offers customers who have chosen this option <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="173" id="page_173"></span>the ability to exploit all available server resources and host multiple sites at the same time.</li>
<li>– Free web hosting (category 1): the web hosting provider offers you a free space to host your website by inserting advertising into your site or simply by minimizing the services to encourage you to opt for a premium option at a later date.</li>
<li>– Free web hosting (category 2): this is a type of hosting that offers users the opportunity to enjoy a free hosting space in order to put their websites online, provided that they distribute some advertising articles at the site level. For this type of hosting, the services offered to clients are very limited.</li></ul>
<p>There are several ways to host a website:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>– making direct contact with the host in order to offer the website to them on a storage medium;</li>
<li>– sending the site to a storage medium via the workstation to the host, which will take care of the hosting task;</li>
<li>– emailing the site to the host;</li>
<li>– using file transfer software to copy website files from a local computer to a remote hosting server. This is the most widely used technique.</li></ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="sec4-1-3"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.3. <i>Referencing</i></span></h3>
<p>Referencing is the set of methods and techniques that aim to ensure a website's recognition on the Internet, i.e. to improve its visibility to search engines so that the pages of the site are displayed in the first results found by the search engine. This step essentially includes:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>– Indexing (submission): this involves ensuring the site is recognized by search engines by using the forms that they propose.</li></ul>
<aside>
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>
<section class="feature3">
<p>EXAMPLE.–</p>
<p>– Sitemap creation at the Google search engine level: <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome">https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome</a>;</p>
<p>– or by making use of the services offered by utilities such as dedicated software or a “multi-referencing” site. The operation in this direction simply consists of completing a form whose data will be sent to search engines and directories for use.</p>

<p>– Positioning: this consists of optimizing the web pages of a site using certain keywords, with the aim of improving the site's position among the results found by the search engine (<i>appearing on the first page of search-engine results</i>).</p>
<aside>
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>

<section>
<h3 id="sec4-1-4"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.4. <i>Updating</i></span></h3>
<p>In order for a website to remain accessible and continue to be appreciated by its target audience, it is beneficial to update its content periodically. This step is similar to hosting and generally consists of replacing the previous version of the site with a new version. This operation can affect only a few pages.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="sec4-1-5"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.1.5. <i>Evaluation</i></span></h3>
<p>In order to evaluate a website, it is possible to use the conventional rules for reviewing and evaluating a document. In general, these rules relate essentially to the context, i.e. the quality of the information and its presentation.</p>
<p>These evaluation criteria commonly exist in the form of several grids, each covering a clearly defined aspect of the site, namely: navigation architecture, ergonomics, information distribution and interactivity.</p>

<h2 id="sec4-2"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.2. Ergonomics of the website</span></h2>
<section>
<h3 id="sec4-2-1"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.2.1. <i>Concept of ergonomics</i></span></h3>
<p>Ergonomics is the study of the activities of human beings and the relationships they maintain with their work environment. This already identified knowledge will be used in the design and improvement of these systems. Ergonomics is generally characterized by two components:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>– efficiency is used to adopt adequate solutions for the use of a product, beyond the common sense of the designer;</li>
<li>– usability is used to identify the degree to which a solution matches the user's capabilities. It is composed essentially of:<ul class="none">
<li>- user-friendliness, which consists of reducing nervous and physical fatigue,</li>
<li>- security, which consists of defining the most appropriate solutions to provide better protection for users.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="176" id="page_176"></span>The application of the concept of ergonomics in the field of website design consists of giving users access to an application that effectively meets their expectations in terms of security and browsing comfort.</p>
<p>The main difficulty that web designers may encounter is the variety in the profiles of site visitors. The following criteria are to be taken into consideration when defining the ergonomics of a website:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>– user expectations: not all Internet users necessarily seek the same type of information and they do not have the same taste in terms of graphic design;</li>
<li>– user habits: refer to behaviors generally acquired by users;</li>
<li>– age of the user: corresponds to the adaptability of the user and their browsing speed;</li>
<li>– equipment: corresponds to the way in which the site is displayed, which may vary from one piece of equipment to another. The website ergonomics must take into account the equipment used by visitors;</li>
<li>– level of knowledge: not all users have the same IT skills. The website ergonomics must take into account the least experienced users.</li></ul>

<tr><td rowspan="2">
<p><b>Soberness</b></p></td>
<td>Simplicity</td>
<td>A very neat website will enhance the appearance of its owner organization.</td></tr>

<td>Streamlined</td>
<td>It is preferable not to use animated images. Animations are usually recommended in order to display important messages because they attract users' attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="3">
<p><b>Readability</b></p></td>
<td>Clarity</td>
<td>It needs to be taken into account that text on the screen is less easy to read than on paper. As a result, the text needs to be sufficiently clear.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Structure</td>
<td>The text should be organized through the use of paragraphs and titles of different levels in order to facilitate reading.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Organization</td>
<td>Information elements should be organized in a hierarchical manner so that the most relevant elements are placed at the start of the page.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Usability</b></td>
<td>Ease of navigation</td>
<td>Typically, access to information should not exceed three clicks (three-click rule).</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="5">
<p><b>Usability</b></p>
<p><b>(cont'd)</b></p></td>
<td>Position identification</td>
<td>At any time, the user must be able to identify their position within the site. As a result, the same graphic charter should be used on all pages to give the visitor the impression that they are still navigating the same site. The site map is a good way of allowing the visitor to know their location.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Freedom to navigate</td>
<td>The site should provide the user with the possibility of consulting the home page as well as the main topics, regardless of their location. Wherever possible, the user will need to navigate between the pages of the site through transverse paths. Avoiding introductory and interstitial pages is necessary, as these can often be a source of annoyance for many users.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Address visibility</td>
<td>The URL of the page in which the user is located must be sufficiently explicit and constantly visible so that the user can easily identify their position in order to be able to return to the previous page.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Tangibility of information</td>
<td>It is necessary for the information presented on the site to be qualified, i.e. there should be clues to identify, for example, the web page's updated date or the site author. Similarly, it is disappointing for a user when a site has an attractive interface but they later find that other sections are still under construction.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Homogeneity of the structure</td>
<td>Navigation elements should be presented on a uniform manner throughout the website and should also be positioned in the same location from one page to the next.</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="3">
<p><b>Rapidity</b></p></td>
<td>Loading time</td>
<td>The time it takes to display a web page should be as short as possible, as generally speaking the majority of users do not wish to wait more than 15 seconds. This time factor is, on the whole, dependent on page size, connection quality, image types used and server capacity.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Optimized images</td>
<td>It is necessary to minimize the size of the images when creating a website (they should generally not exceed 40 KB). Please note that PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is the format most recommended for use on the Net, but generally it is also possible to use other formats according to your needs.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Unresized images</td>
<td>For quality reasons, it is best to keep the images in their actual size, without modification.</td></tr>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="178" id="page_178"></span><b>Interactivity</b></p></td>
<td>Hyperlinks</td>
<td>Interactivity refers to all types of interactions between the Internet user and the website. Hyperlinks favor a variety of possibilities in this domain and allow users to take several different paths according to their wishes. It is necessary to define enough links between the pages of a site in order to facilitate navigation and reading.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Breaking down of information</td>
<td>In order to facilitate the assimilation of information by users, and in some cases to arouse their curiosity, it is advisable to break information down. This breakdown can be translated in particular by hyperlinks to the different parts of the article.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Facilitation of exchanges</td>
<td>It is preferable to put everything in place in order to make it easier to exchange with users, in particular to gather their opinions and requests, with the aim of improving the site. As a result, the user must have the means to easily contact the site administrator (an email address, a contact form, etc.).</td></tr>

<p><b>Adaptability</b></p></td>
<td>Adaptability</td>
<td>Adaptability refers to the possibility of customizing the website with the intervention of the Internet user.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Font repositioning</td>
<td>It is preferable to define site-level text fonts in absolute values, to give users the possibility of resizing them according to their preference.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Adaptivity</b></td>
<td>Adaptivity</td>
<td>Adaptivity means that the display of the website needs to adapt to different screen types, namely, a personal computer, tablet and smartphone.</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="3">
<p><b>Accessibility</b></p></td>
<td>Universality of access</td>
<td>Accessibility refers to the fact that the site needs to be accessed on a universal scale, that is, by anyone able to connect to the Internet. This objective can be achieved by applying a number of accessibility rules, independently of users’ hardware or software configuration.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Interoperability</td>
<td>When developing a website, it is advisable to respect accessibility rules such as those of the W3C (World Wide Wed Consortium), in order to ensure good interoperability, i.e. the site can be accessed by different browsers.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Transparency of formats</td>
<td>It is preferable for the formats to be transparent, i.e. the user should be able to view them in text mode. It is also advisable for images or animations to be used as a complement only and not as a replacement for text information.</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="5">
<p><b>Accessibility (cont’d)</b></p></td>
<td><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="179" id="page_179"></span>Caption</td>
<td>It is preferable to accompany images and illustrate them with a caption, which should appear in the event of an image display problem (using the <i>alt </i>attribute). The purpose of this action is to allow users with visual impairments to identify the meaning of the image.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Choice of colors</td>
<td>It is advisable to closely examine the choice of colors to be used in order to prevent readability problems for users and especially for individuals who are color blind.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sound use of style sheets</td>
<td>Text content at site level needs to be accessible even without a style sheet.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Adapted contrast</td>
<td>A good level of contrast is needed between the text and the background color of the page in order to avoid readability problems.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Modifiable font size</td>
<td>It is preferable for the font size to be in adaptable mode so that the text can be enlarged if needed. Fonts that are too small are not recommended because they can cause legibility and fatigue issues when reading.</td></tr>

<h3 id="sec4-2-5"><span class="codeColorBlue">4.2.5. <i>Dimensions of web pages</i></span></h3>
<p>A web page’s dimensions generally depend on users’ display definition. In the case of width, the best solution is to choose a value lower than the horizontal definition of most users, so as not to require them to scroll down the screen by using the horizontal scroll bar. A short page makes it easy for visitors to quickly browse its content in order to retrieve the information they are interested in. In terms of length, it is preferable to not exceed three to five screen heights. As a result, long pages risk being ignored or not being read in full. In order to guarantee a good display for all visitors, it is advisable to use the <i>adaptive design</i> principle, which automatically adjusts the display of a site to the screen size of the equipment used.</p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="181" id="page_181"></span>A search engine is a database formed of sites accessible via keyword search.

<p>A metasearch engine, or a search aggregator, is a software that retrieves its information from multiple search engines. More specifically, the metasearch engine sends its requests to a set of search engines, retrieves the results from each of them and then discards similar results. Finally, it plans a classification of these results.</p>
