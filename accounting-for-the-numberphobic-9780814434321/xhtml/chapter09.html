<h2 class="chtit0">Putting It All Together</h2>
<h2 class="chtit1">Your Financial Dashboard in Real Time</h2>
<p class="noindent">When I was 16, I couldn’t wait to get my driver’s license. It was a rite of passage, the promise of adulthood and greater freedom. Never mind those horrible accident photos we were shown in driver’s ed in an attempt to get us to recognize there was risk involved. That wasn’t going to happen to me! I knew better. I wasn’t foolish. I was responsible, and my level-headed nature would be enough to keep me safe. A few decades and one near-fatal car accident later, all my delusions had vanished. A small patch of black ice is all it took one frigid February afternoon to lose control of a few tons of heavy steel hurtling down the highway at 55 miles per hour.</p>
<p class="indent">After my accident, I knew I had to do something or risk losing my confidence behind the wheel, so I took a high-performance driving course. While my classmates wanted to learn how to cut turns at 90 miles an hour, I just wanted to learn how to survive in all road conditions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page184"></a>My instructors were racecar drivers. Part of the curriculum was to take students out in a long-bed truck to a skid pad on the track. During the demonstration of the exercise, the instructor drove the truck in a tight circle at 40 miles an hour. The truck skidded all over the track, which was exactly what had happened with my car when I had the accident, just before impact—and the instructor showed us how to handle it.</p>
<p class="indent">The instructor saw I was shaken by the demonstration and asked me if I wanted to continue. I replied, “I want to skid out a thousand times and learn how to handle any kind of skid. I want to change my innate responses to a skid to avoid accidents in the future. I want my safe response to a skid to become second nature.” So while everyone else was eating lunch, my instructor and I skidded on that infernal pad over and over until good reflexes finally kicked in, with the hope that if I ever did skid out again, I’d have a faster and more informed response.</p>
<p class="indent">Many entrepreneurs I’ve met feel about business as I initially did about driving. They see only the promise and none of the risks. Or if they do see the risks, they minimize them through faulty assumptions. But if you can read your financial dashboard, you are in a position to make better business decisions beforehand, no matter what the economic conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">What I’ve tried to do in the book is to help you manage the skids and risks when you run a small business. Norm Brodsky, veteran serial entrepreneur, author, and financial columnist, whom you’ll meet in <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>, estimates that more than half the businesses that go bankrupt in the United States do so because those running the business couldn’t read the financial risks before they reached the point of no return.</p>
<p class="indent">I want to spare every small business manager reading this book that kind of agony. The same way my racecar instructor taught me the basics in the classroom before he took me out on the track, I’ve been instructing you in <a href="chapter01.html">Chapters 1</a> through <a href="chapter08.html">8</a>. You’ve been learning <a id="page185"></a>about each of the gauges of the financial dashboard, one by one and line by line, so that you can understand what each gauge or statement measures, and so that you know how to read them. I wanted you to maintain focus and to be able to take your time with each idea so it would make sense and stay with you.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve kept you in the classroom—off the road, so to speak—to teach you how to interpret what your dashboard is telling you.</p>
<p class="indent">Now it’s time to go out on the track, turn on the ignition, and see what happens when you turn the wheel, step on the gas, or tap the brake. Now it’s time to see what happens to each statement on the financial dashboard as standard transactions take place.</p>
<h3 id="h_35" class="h3">BASIC BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are really just a few types of recurring activities that drive a small business. While financial advisors make a princely living trying to convince you otherwise, the following transactions, with some slight variations, probably cover 75 percent what occurs when running a small business:</p>
<p class="blist">•    You sell a product or a service for cash.</p>
<p class="blist">•    You sell a product or service on payment terms.</p>
<p class="blist">•    You collect on a receivable.</p>
<p class="blist">•    You pay an expense with a check or on terms.</p>
<p class="blist">•    You pay an expense with a credit card.</p>
<p class="blist">•    You take out a loan.</p>
<p class="blist">•    You pay back a loan.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens to your financial dashboard with each of these events.<a id="page186"></a></p>
<h3 class="h3">Selling a Product or Service for Cash</h3>
<p class="noindent">When you sell a product or service, you receive cash or a cash equivalent, like a credit card, as payment. (Note: I’m not getting into discounts and credit card exchange fees right now. Let’s keep things simple.)</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Net Income Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">Net revenue increases by the value of the sale, COGS increases by the value of what it cost you to manufacture, purchase, or deliver that product or service, and gross margin increases too, by the difference between net revenue and COGS. Higher gross margin helps us breathe a little easier. If you’re receiving at least a 45 percent premium over COGS, as we discussed in <a href="chapter02.html">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="chapter03.html">3</a>, then you’re making money on every sale, which is what you want. What was that mantra again? <em>Every product or service must have a gross margin of at least 30 percent of net revenue or 45 percent above cost of goods sold.</em></p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Cash Flow Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">When customers pay you cash, your cash position improves. Any time cash comes in or out of the business for any reason, that transaction will always get captured on the Cash Flow Statement as either Cash In or Cash Out. In this case, Cash In increases as soon as payment is made. The faster cash comes into the business, the easier it is for the business to pay its bills. Love that.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Balance Sheet</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">The three lines that would probably change on the Balance Sheet as a result of this cash sale are cash (current asset), inventory (current asset), and potentially, owner’s equity.</p>
<p class="indent">Cash is a current asset, so any time it changes on the Cash Flow Statement, it will also change on the Balance Sheet. If you manage <a id="page187"></a>a cash-based business, like selling ice cream, every sale is most likely a cash sale, so when net revenue increases, the cash balance increases on both the Cash Flow Statement and the Balance Sheet. Since you’re making a positive gross margin (reflected on the Net Income Statement) each time you sell an ice cream cone, the Balance Sheet shows an increase in both current assets and owner’s equity equal to the value of the gross margin on the sale.</p>
<p class="indent">Accounts receivable doesn’t change because the item was paid for on the spot—happily the business manager doesn’t have to worry about collecting outstanding invoices.</p>
<p class="indent">Another line that will reflect a change on the Balance Sheet is inventory. You remember from <a href="chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a> that inventory is considered a current asset because it can be converted into cash within 12 months. Before a sale, the only place you’ll see the value of that inventory is on the Balance Sheet under current assets on the inventory line, valued at what you paid for it, as COGS. As soon as some of that inventory is sold, however, inventory on the Balance Sheet decreases because the customer walked out with the product. Inventory decreases, but you sold that ice cream at a profit. If you can keep doing that—and the profit is at least COGS plus 45 percent—you’ll build a going concern.</p>
<p class="indent">If you <em>buy</em> ice cream at COGS on payment terms and sell it right away for cash, your cash flow looks good. But what if it’s the other way around? What if you have a product or service that you <em>sell</em> on payment terms?</p>
<h3 class="h3">Selling a Product or Service on Payment Terms</h3>
<p class="noindent">If you are a service provider, it’s highly likely you provide the service and bill the customer to pay you at a later date. This transaction on the Net Income Statement looks similar to a cash transaction, but the Cash Flow Statement will not reflect the sale until the cash is collected on the invoice.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page188"></a><em><strong>What Happens on Your Net Income Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">The sale is captured on the Net Income Statement as net revenue whether the customer pays right away or a month from now. Both COGS and gross margin increase, just as they did on the cash sale. However, the business has to capture the fact that the client still has to pay this bill, which it does on the Balance Sheet. Remember, the Balance Sheet has an important role because it captures everything that’s going on, both when the sale is made and when it’s paid for.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Cash Flow Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">Nada! Zip! The Cash Flow Statement shows no activity because the business sold a product or a service that will be paid at a later time. No cash changed hands. The Cash Flow Statement is waiting patiently.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Balance Sheet</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">The customer still owes the business payment for goods delivered or services rendered. This customer IOU is captured on the Balance Sheet as a current asset on the accounts receivable line, which increases by the value of the outstanding invoice. Inventory, also a current asset, decreases by the COGS value of the inventory that’s been sold. Nowhere else on your financial dashboard can you see how much money is owed the business except on the Balance Sheet. The difference between the invoice value of the receivable and the COGS value of the inventory is the gross margin made on the sale. The value of that gross margin is reflected on the Balance Sheet under owner’s equity.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s why <em>collecting on all your receivables</em> is so important. If you don’t collect from your customers, the business is carrying the burden of paying for the COGS on the products shipped without any benefit of cash payment or increase in owner’s equity. That’s accelerating the business in the wrong direction!</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page189"></a><img src="../images/f032.jpg" alt="images" width="500" height="345"/></p>
<h3 class="h3">Collecting on a Receivable</h3>
<p class="noindent">After reading <a href="chapter05.html">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="chapter06.html">6</a>, you understand that an invoice that has not been paid by a customer becomes a receivable to the business—and that collecting on your receivables is extremely important.</p>
<p class="indent">When Susie sends you payment on an outstanding receivable, it’s usually in the form of a check or a wire transfer. If you have a choice, choose the wire transfer. You’ll have access to the cash sooner than if you have to wait for a check to clear.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Net Income Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">Nothing changes on the Net Income Statement when you collect a receivable. The sale was already captured as net revenue when the sale was made, not when it’s paid.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page190"></a><em><strong>What Happens on Your Cash Flow Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">As soon as the wire transfer arrives in your account or the check from Susie clears, Cash In and Ending Cash increase on the Cash Flow Statement. No surprise, but how nice that cash flow just improved. It’s not that the number went up that’s important here; what’s important is that you have the cash to pay your expenses!</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Balance Sheet</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">On the Balance Sheet, the value of total current assets doesn’t change because you just swapped out one current asset for another of equal value—an account receivable for cash. Now you have more cash to work with and your accounts receivable are smaller. The business becomes more liquid when there’s more cash. This is what you want.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/f033.jpg" alt="images" width="570" height="410"/><a id="page191"></a></p>
<h3 class="h3">Paying an Expense with Cash or on Terms</h3>
<p class="noindent">Whenever you pay a bill, it’s considered a cash transaction, whether you pay via check, wire transfer, or a greasy paper sack of crumpled dollar bills. This pertains to any bill, whether it’s for a fixed expense, such as rent or insurance, or a variable expense, such as supplies, advertising, or raw materials.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say the business paid the rent for the month. Here’s what you’d see on your financial dashboard as soon as that transaction clears.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Net Income Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">When you pay a bill, it shows up as either a fixed or variable expense on the Net Income Statement. Fixed expenses are the same regardless of the volume of sales, whereas variable expenses tend to increase with changes in sales volume, as you may recall from <a href="chapter02.html">Chapter 2</a>. If your business uses the cash basis of accounting, this expense gets captured when it’s paid. If your business uses the accrual basis of accounting (remember cash basis and accrual basis from <a href="chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a>?), this expense gets captured in the month the invoice is due.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Cash Flow Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">When you pay a bill, Cash Out increases and Ending Cash decreases. Simple as that. However, if the bill offers the option of paying in 30 days (instead of saying “due on receipt”) and you choose to wait (as most of us do), the Cash Flow Statement does not change until the bill is paid.</p>
<p class="indent">I hope that this is all becoming second nature to you. In fact, if much of this chapter seems like old hat, I’ve done my job and you’re well on your way to success.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Balance Sheet</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">Stop! Read no further. Try to guess what happens here. Seriously, jot down what are by now your informed guesses. Done? Okay, now you can go on to the next paragraph.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page192"></a><img src="../images/f034.jpg" alt="images" width="672" height="360"/></p>
<p class="indent">If the business pays a bill immediately, current assets decreases (on the cash line) by the amount of the invoice. If the business pays at some point in the future, usually 30 days, the invoice is captured as a current liability (on the accounts payable line), and so the total of your current liabilities increases by the amount of the invoice. Once that invoice is paid, a current liability (accounts payable) decreases and a current asset (cash) decreases by a corresponding amount. (Again, I’m avoiding any discussions on discounts or interest or late fees here.) The Balance Sheet balances—and owner’s equity remains the same—because a current asset, in this case cash, has paid for a current liability, in this case an account payable.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Paying an Expense with a Credit Card</h3>
<p class="noindent">If you pay a bill using a credit card, you have incurred a current liability for the business. Instead of owing the supplier, for example, now you owe the credit card company. What really happened is that the credit card company paid the supplier on behalf of the business.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page193"></a><em><strong>What Happens on Your Net Income Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">Whether you’re using the cash or accrual method of accounting, the Net Income Statement shows the fixed and variable expenses paid that month. If the credit card balance was not fully paid off, incurring interest charges on the balance owed, these additional charges show up under variable expenses on a separate line called “Interest Expense.”</p>
<p class="indent">Credit cards are used for many types of expenses, such as marketing (business lunches), entertaining, and travel expenses, and these expenses are broken out as separate line items showing each one has been paid. This is actually quite useful, as it forces you to take note of how you are using your credit card, since there is no single line item for “credit card expense.”</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Cash Flow Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">When you purchase a product or service with credit, nothing changed on the cash flow statement because no cash was involved. A short-term loan was extended by the credit card company to the business. When the credit card bill gets paid, however, Cash Out increases, reducing Ending Cash. The Cash Flow Statement also has line items that capture what was paid and when it was paid. That too makes it easy to keep track of actual Cash Out and helps you build your cash flow budget for the future.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Balance Sheet</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">The actual balance owed on the credit card or credit line shows up on the Balance Sheet under current liabilities on the “credit line payable” line. It is considered a short-term loan that is outstanding. My personal bias is that credit card bills should be paid in full monthly. Others may disagree, but I’ve found that it’s one of the most important ways to prevent debt problems from arising.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page194"></a>When the credit card bill is actually paid, the credit line payable under current liabilities decreases, and a current asset, cash, decreases by the same amount. The Balance Sheet stays balanced—and owner’s equity remains the same.</p>
<p class="indent">The biggest trap I’ve seen small business managers get into is growing current liabilities on credit cards too large or too fast. Either they can’t pay the balance off or they pay only the minimum monthly payment. The risk grows of never paying off the balance due to high interest fees that can mushroom quickly. Remember that poor fellow from <a href="chapter07.html">Chapter 7</a>, the one with $400,000 due on the business’s five credit cards? Don’t let his plight become your own. A word to the wise: Don’t ever let current liabilities, what the business owes, grow larger than current assets. If you manage the business with this advice in mind, you’ll reap the dual benefit of protecting your sanity and keeping the business solvent.</p>
<p class="indent">And one last word on paying with credit: If there is an increase in current liabilities without an equal increase in assets, owner’s equity decreases. Bad idea! The net worth of the business has eroded. This may occasionally be okay in the short term, but you want this downward trend in owner’s equity to reverse as quickly as possible. The section entitled “How to Improve Your Balance Sheet” in <a href="chapter08.html">Chapter 8</a> took you through how to do this.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Taking Out a Loan</h3>
<p class="noindent">A credit card or a credit line is a short-term liability. If you have a credit line with the bank, it’s possible to use the cash proceeds from that loan for many reasons. The bank might place some constraints, but typically, a credit line is used for paying suppliers, buying raw materials, and financing the time lag between when a sale is made and when the client pays the invoice. The business still has bills to pay as it waits for client payment, so that’s called “financing <a id="page195"></a>the accounts receivable gap.” Until you use the cash for one purpose or another, little changes on your dashboard.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Net Income Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">Nothing changes on the Net Income Statement until either the interest payment is due or you pay the interest on the loan. When you pay the interest, it shows up as interest expense. Repayment of the principle is not viewed as an expense and therefore does not show up (you have to go to the Balance Sheet for that).</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Cash Flow Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">The Cash Flow Statement captures the inflow of cash you’ve drawn down from the credit line as an increase in Cash In. Ending Cash will increase as well, unless and until it gets spent—hopefully on necessities, not luxuries.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Balance Sheet</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">The Balance Sheet captures both the inflow of cash under current assets as well as the outstanding current liability of the credit line that must be paid back to the bank. Since assets and liabilities both increase by the same amount, there is no change to owner’s equity. If the bank extends a credit line and it isn’t used, you don’t have a liability. There’s nothing to pay back. The moment you use part or all of an available credit line, it gets captured as a current liability (under credit line payable) on the Balance Sheet.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s the deal. When you take out debt, make sure the cash proceeds are invested in something that will increase revenues, improve productivity (lower the COGS), or decrease expenses. That way, the cash from the credit line has the potential to improve the profitability and cash flow of the business. Read the last two sentences carefully. This single piece of advice is worth the entire price of this book.<a id="page196"></a></p>
<h3 class="h3">Paying Back a Loan</h3>
<p class="noindent">A loan has two parts, the <strong>interest</strong> (the amount charged by the lender to the borrower for the use of the money) and the <strong>principal</strong> (the original value of the loan or what remains of it as you pay it off). Let’s assume a monthly transaction where you pay both interest and principal on a long-term loan, for example, a mortgage. Here’s what happens on the financial dashboard.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Net Income Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">The Net Income Statement captures the interest payment as a variable expense, as it does all interest payments whether the loan is a short-term (current) or a long-term liability. The repayment of principal will not be captured on the Net Income Statement because it’s not viewed as an expense, but merely a repayment of debt. Net income will decrease for the period as the interest expense is realized and you’ll see that reflected on the Net Income Statement.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Cash Flow Statement</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">The Cash Flow Statement will capture the decrease in cash due to payment of interest as well as principle. Cash Out will increase, and Ending Cash will decrease.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>What Happens on Your Balance Sheet</strong></em></p>
<p class="noindent">As the principal gets paid off, the Balance Sheet will capture the decrease in cash under current assets as well as the equivalent decrease in the amount of debt outstanding under long-term liabilities.</p>
<p class="indent">If the loan has been used to purchase a building that improved in value, cash decreases, but fixed assets might very well increase depending on what happens to the value of real estate. If the loan has been used to build inventory, then again, cash decreases while inventory increases. What the loan was used for—and whether that asset increases or decreases in value over time—determines whether owner’s equity increases or decreases.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page197"></a>Now that you can anticipate the outcomes of typical day-to-day business transactions, you’re ready to leave the track and start driving on the expressway. Before you do, however, there are key ratios you need to know that will act like a high-tech GPS system. They’ll orient you on the journey so you’ll know when to make course corrections.</p>
<h3 id="h_36" class="h3">RATIOS AND PERCENTAGES HELP FIND THE PATTERNS</h3>
<p class="noindent">It’s important to be able to track the numbers as transactions happen, which I just did for you above. The larger goal, however, is to be able to see patterns in the business and anticipate what they mean for the future.</p>
<p class="indent">Ratios and percentages will help you see how the numbers relate to each other. It’s not enough to track how key measures are increasing or decreasing, but how they are doing relative to other measures. Accountants call these comparisons “ratios.” Ratios are simple fractions, as you’ll see in a moment, but like any fraction, you can also express the fraction as a percent. Accounting convention presents certain ratios—net margin and gross margin—as percentages, while others—current ratio and quick ratio—remain simple ratios. Whether you think of them as ratios or percentages, they allow you to compare the performance of the business from one period to another. They help you see what is improving and what is having problems before the crisis hits. If you keep track of the ratios and percentages listed here, you’ll be in ship shape.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Net Margin Percentage</h3>
<p class="noindent">The <strong>net margin percentage</strong> shows the relationship between your net revenue and your true (net) profit. It expresses the relationship between the top and bottom lines on your Net Income Statement.</p>
<p class="eq"><a id="page198"></a>Net Margin Percentage =<br/>Net Income ÷ Net Revenue × 100</p>
<p class="indent">This is an efficiency ratio. It measures the portion of every dollar of net revenue that becomes net profit for that period. If your net margin percentage is improving, it means more of your net revenues drop to your bottom line. That’s what you want. Changes in this percentage show whether the profit percentage is improving or degrading. Track it from month to month to check on the direction of its change. Also, it’s important that you know what profit percentages are in your industry. If your profit percentages are higher than your industry’s average, you’re on the right track. If not, you need to improve gross margin (by charging more or reducing COGS) or reduce operating expenses.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll find net revenue and net income on the Net Income Statement.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Gross Margin Percentage</h3>
<p class="noindent">Gross margin equals your net revenue minus the cost of goods sold (I know, I know. I'm really putting you to sleep here). The <strong>gross margin percentage</strong> shows you what percentage of every net revenue dollar is gross margin—that is, profit before expenses. This is important to know because gross margin is the money that pays all the business’s bills.</p>
<p class="eq">Gross Margin Percentage = Gross Margin ÷ Net Revenue × 100</p>
<p class="indent">You learned in <a href="chapter02.html">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="chapter03.html">3</a> that 30 percent is the goal, that is, 30 cents on every dollar of sales should be gross margin if the business can be expected to survive. Again, each industry has its norms for gross margin percentage and you should know what it is in your industry; 30 percent is merely a benchmark.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page199"></a>You’ll also find net revenue and gross margin on the Net Income Statement.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Accounts Receivable Turnover Rate</h3>
<p class="noindent">The <strong>accounts receivable turnover rate</strong> is a measure of the efficiency of your collections department (is that you? your bookkeeper? your mother-in-law?). It is found on the “days receivable report,” which your bookkeeper or accountant can create for you, and it tells you how many times a year you collect all your accounts receivable.</p>
<p class="eq">Accounts Receivable Turnover Rate =<br/>Yearly Credit Sales ÷ Accounts Receivable</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Credit sales</strong> are sales transactions where the client receives the good or service and is extended payment terms to pay the bill with cash or a cash equivalent at some point in the future. In this equation we are using the total amount of credit sales throughout the year.</p>
<p class="indent">Hopefully, the number on that report comes close to 12. That means you’re collecting on your receivables every month. The smaller the number, the longer it’s taking you to collect on accounts receivable—and the worse for your business.</p>
<p class="indent">But be careful: Since this is an average, some seriously “aged” accounts may be hidden there. You’re probably better off looking at that monthly aging invoices report I suggested you have your bookkeeper generate for you, back in <a href="chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Current Ratio</h3>
<p class="noindent">Your <strong>current ratio</strong> is a measure of short-term liquidity. It’s found by looking at total current assets and total current liabilities on your Balance Sheet and will tell you if there’s enough liquidity in the business to pay short-term obligations.</p>
<p class="eq"><a id="page200"></a>Current Ratio =<br/>Total Current Assets ÷ Total Current Liabilities</p>
<p class="indent">Total current assets include cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. Just divide total current assets by total current liabilities and you’ll get your current ratio. A ratio of 2:1 will pretty much guarantee sleep-filled nights for you, and stress-free days for your bookkeeper.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Quick Ratio</h3>
<p class="noindent">The <strong>quick ratio</strong> is a variation on the current ratio presented above, but it removes the value of inventory from current assets. That makes it a more conservative estimate of how much liquidity is in the business. (Sometimes inventory is hard to liquidate, so this ratio has backed out the value of inventory from total current assets.)</p>
<p class="eq">Quick Ratio =<br/>(Cash + Accounts Receivable) ÷ Total Current Liabilities</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll always find cash, accounts receivable, and current liabilities on the Balance Sheet. These current accounts provide a sharp focus on how much cash and cash equivalents are available at a given moment to pay total current liabilities if payment is required right now. You always want this ratio to be 1:1 at a minimum.</p>
<p class="indent">Ideally, you want current assets to exceed current liabilities in case the bank or a supplier demands payment immediately, which can happen in tough markets.</p>
<p class="indent">As the business grows, there are other ratios to keep an eye on, but the ones listed above provide a great foundation for managing a small business. If you watch these on a monthly basis, you’re so far ahead of your peers, they’ll be eating your dust.</p>
<p class="star">* * *</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page201"></a>So there you have the financial dashboard in motion, and a GPS system to help get you where you want to go. You should always start with the Net Income Statement because that’s where net revenues are captured and all the expenses associated with generating them and with running the business.</p>
<p class="indent">Then you look at the Cash Flow Statement to see what has changed there, because keeping tabs on ending cash is crucial when you’re trying to build a going concern and avoid bankruptcy. The Balance Sheet always comes last because it takes numbers from the other two statements and integrates the cumulative effects of all transactions from the day the business was born.</p>
<p class="indent">Standard accounting software will calculate these ratios with a few clicks of the mouse. You can have your bookkeeper show you how, or even ask that these ratios be included on the regular financial reports he or she generates.</p>
<p class="indent">What I learned on that racetrack was that a skid didn’t have to end in a near-fatal crash; learning how to steer made all the difference. Now you know how to steer your business.</p>
<h3 id="h_37" class="h3a">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
<div class="h3aaa">
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>Daily</strong></em></p>
<p class="arlist"><img class="inline" src="../images/arr.jpg" alt="image" width="11" height="12"/>    Check your cash balances daily to compare how much cash you have against the cash you’ll need. (You learned to capture your “needs” by making a cash flow budget in <a href="chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>.) An online bank account will make checking cash balances and paying bills electronically that much faster and easier.</p>
<p class="arlist"><img class="inline" src="../images/arr.jpg" alt="image" width="11" height="12"/>    Deposit checks immediately so you have access to the cash as soon as possible. Out-of-town checks take that much longer to clear. If any check bounces, you’ll learn that sooner too.</p>
<p class="arlist"><a id="page202"></a><img class="inline" src="../images/arr.jpg" alt="image" width="11" height="12"/>    Use the information from the “aging invoices report” that your bookkeeper has generated at your request to put collection calls on your calendar. Make those calls part of your daily routine before their bills come due. (<a href="chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a> showed you easy ways to do this.)</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>Weekly</strong></em></p>
<p class="arlist"><img class="inline" src="../images/arr.jpg" alt="image" width="11" height="12"/>    Have your accountant or bookkeeper create a Cash Flow Statement for your review every week.</p>
<p class="arlist"><img class="inline" src="../images/arr.jpg" alt="image" width="11" height="12"/>    Compare your weekly Cash Flow Statement against your cash flow budget and make adjustments for the following week based on what has changed.</p>
<p class="arlist"><img class="inline" src="../images/arr.jpg" alt="image" width="11" height="12"/>    Review all the payments customers made that week and make note of the late payers. That will help you determine if you still want to service those clients or change the payment terms.</p>
<p class="arlist"><img class="inline" src="../images/arr.jpg" alt="image" width="11" height="12"/>    If you have someone, like an accounts payable clerk, paying bills on behalf of the business, make sure you review those checks with their corresponding invoices for every payment over $250 before the checks go out. It keeps everyone accountable.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><em><strong>Monthly</strong></em></p>
<p class="arlist"><img class="inline" src="../images/arr.jpg" alt="image" width="11" height="12"/>    Have your accountant or bookkeeper create a Net Income Statement and Balance Sheet for your review every month.</p>
<p class="arlist"><img class="inline" src="../images/arr.jpg" alt="image" width="11" height="12"/>    Look at the key ratios and percentages we discussed in this chapter and see how they’ve changed. If they’ve improved, great. If they’ve started to slip, put a simple plan together to <a id="page203"></a>help improve them next month. Every chapter in this book gives you tips on how to do that.</p>
<p class="arlist"><img class="inline" src="../images/arr.jpg" alt="image" width="11" height="12"/>    Review your credit card statements every month to make sure every charge listed is legitimate. If you catch a problem quickly, there’s a higher likelihood you’ll get better support from the credit card issuer to help resolve it in your favor.<a id="page204"></a></p>
