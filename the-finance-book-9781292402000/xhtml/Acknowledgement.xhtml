<p class="noindent">Stuart Warner: To all the people I have ever taught. Thank you for your attentiveness, willingness to learn, challenging questions and occasionally laughing in the right places. You have helped me to develop, refine and fine tune my own understanding of finance, as well as my debatable sense of humour. Your contribution both motivated and enabled me to write this book.</p>
