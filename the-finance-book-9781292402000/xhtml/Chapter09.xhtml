<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindentai"><a id="gloss-114" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_114"><span class="italic">Tangible fixed assets</span></a> (TFA) are assets that possess physical substance. Examples include land, property, equipment, motor vehicles, etc.</p>
<p class="noindentai">The term <span class="italic">fixed</span> denotes an intention by the company to use the asset within the business over the long term (in excess of one year), i.e. to generate revenues over a number of years. This is in contrast to <span class="italic">current</span> assets, such as stock, where the speed or frequency of sale is often considered the key objective (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11 Stock</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindentai">The cost of using TFA is recognised through <a id="gloss-37" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_37"><span class="italic">depreciation</span></a>. <span class="italic">Depreciation</span> is an accounting expense which attempts to spread the cost of TFA over their life in the business. In effect, depreciation reflects the usage, wearing-out or ‘consumption’ of TFA.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>TFA held by a business are an important indicator of a company’s capability or capacity to provide goods or services to its customers. For example, the investment by a manufacturing company in plant and machinery indicates the ability (or capability) to supply product to meet current and future demand. A retailer’s investment in land can indicate its potential to expand its physical presence in response to new growth opportunities. Businesses that do not <a id="page_87"></a>invest in fixed assets or do not maintain their fixed asset capability may be unable to respond to opportunities or continue to service existing demand over the long term.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Lenders often look to a company’s TFA as a source of potential security against loans made to the company (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter30.xhtml">Chapter 30 Debt finance</a></span>).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>The efficiency with which a company uses its TFA can be assessed by accountants and analysts to compare performance between businesses (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter23.xhtml">Chapter 23 Profitability performance measures</a></span>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">TFA are usually grouped and reported by type or ‘class’ of asset (land and buildings, fixtures and fittings, plant and machinery etc.).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Depreciation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Tangible fixed assets have a finite <span class="italic">useful economic life</span>. Useful economic life is the period over which a business expects to generate benefits from an asset. It is an <span class="italic">estimate</span>, made by management at the time the asset is purchased, and reflects the period over which that asset is expected to help generate revenue for the business. For example, Ocado uses vans to make home deliveries of groceries to customers. The vans will have a useful economic life, for example 5 years. Ocado will estimate the useful economic life to reflect the period over which vans will ‘wear out’, i.e. no longer be adequate to meet the needs of the business. At the end of the period the vans will need to be replaced.</p>
<p class="noindent">To reflect the usage of the asset, a proportion of the original cost of that asset is recognised annually as an expense in the profit and loss account. This charge is known as <span class="italic">depreciation</span> and it reflects the systematic wearing out of the asset.</p>
<p class="noindent">The depreciation charge also has the effect of reducing the value at which the asset is held in the balance sheet. At each balance sheet date, the <span class="italic">net book value</span> represents the remaining cost of the asset, i.e. that proportion of the asset’s value that has not yet been depreciated.</p>
<p class="noindent">All tangible fixed assets with the exception of land (explained below) must be depreciated.<a id="page_88"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2a">Net book value</h2>
<p class="noindent">TFA are stated at net book value (NBV) in the balance sheet. The NBV is the <span class="italic">cost</span> of the asset less <span class="italic">accumulated depreciation</span> (the total sum of all years’ depreciation charged for that asset).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Example 1</h2>
<p class="noindent">ABC Ltd owns assets purchased 6 years ago for £100,000. The company depreciates its assets at 5% per annum. NBV at the end of the current year would be included in the financial statements as shown below:</p>
<table class="table">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="noindent">Accumulated depreciation has reduced the cost of the asset by £30,000. This represents 6 years’ worth of annual depreciation (5% of £100,000 annually). Note that both cost and depreciation are reported separately in arriving at the NBV. This enables a reader to gain an understanding of the asset’s remaining productive capacity or useful life. In the above example, the accumulated depreciation is relatively low (when compared to the cost) which indicates that the assets still have significant productive capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is important to never confuse NBV with <span class="italic">market value</span>. The latter is a measure of the current worth of an asset and can only be determined by reference to market conditions, including for example inflation or asset availability. NBV is an accounting concept that is not intended to represent market value. In fact, NBV typically understates the market value of assets as asset prices generally rise over time. This distinction becomes relevant when considering how to value a business using financial statements (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter28.xhtml">Chapter 28 Business valuation</a></span>).<a id="page_89"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2a">Calculating depreciation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Different methods may be used to calculate depreciation. Accounting standards, perhaps surprisingly, permit companies a (limited) choice over the method of depreciation applied (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>). While the method chosen should be appropriate and consistently applied, the existence of choice provides some discretion to directors, which in turn could be used to influence financial results.</p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps the most widely used method to depreciate fixed assets is the <span class="italic">straight-line</span> method. Under this method, depreciation is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="mathi"><math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="">
 <mrow>
  <mtext>Annual depreciation expense</mtext><mo>=</mo><mfrac>
   <mrow>
    <mtext>Asset cost less estimated residual value</mtext></mrow>
   <mrow>
    <mtext>Estimated useful life</mtext></mrow>
  </mfrac>
  </mrow>
</math></p>
<p class="noindent">This method results in the same annual depreciation charge every year (if this were to be shown graphically, the annual depreciation charge would appear as a ‘straight line’, hence the name).</p>
<p class="noindent">Other popular methods include <span class="italic">reducing balance</span> or <span class="italic">sum of years’ digits</span> (see the <span class="bold">Nice to know</span> section below).</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no reason why an asset should have a zero value at the end of its useful economic life. Ocado, for example, may use their vans for 4 years and likely sell them on to a third party for a residual sum. The useful life of 4 years is an estimate by Ocado management of the period over which the asset will be of use to their business and therefore when it needs to be replaced. It is a judgement that informs the company’s asset replacement policy.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Example 2</h2>
<p class="noindent">XYZ Ltd purchases a new delivery van during the year for £20,000. Each van purchased for use has an average useful economic life of 4 years, after which the company replaces it with a newer model. <a id="page_90"></a>The estimated residual value of the van at the end of its useful economic life is £8,000.</p>

<p class="noindent">Because the asset has a residual value, it is the van’s <span class="italic">net</span> cost of £12,000 (£20,000 less £8,000) only that is charged as depreciation against revenues over the asset’s 4-year useful life (at £3,000 per year)</p>
<p class="noindent">The van’s NBV will decline over the four years as follows:</p>

<p class="noindent">The depreciation charged against profits each year is constant at £3,000 and this charge reduces the balance sheet cost by the same amount each year. At the end of the 4-year period, the balance sheet cost will have reduced by £12,000, an amount identical to the expense reflected in the profit and loss account over that 4-year period.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note in this example that the asset is not fully depreciated. This is because the asset was estimated to have a residual value of £8,000. The effect of the straight-line method of calculation is to deplete the cost of the asset, in equal annual amounts, to arrive at the residual value of £8,000 by the end of the asset’s useful economic life. In contrast, if the asset had a nil residual value, the full amount of the asset cost would have been depreciated over the 4-year period (i.e. £5,000 per annum) to arrive at £0 NBV at the end of the 4-year period.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="italic">residual value</span> included in the calculation above represents management’s estimate of the sum for which the asset could be disposed of at the end of the asset’s estimated useful life. The residual value is estimated at the time of original purchase and may differ to the actual amount realised on eventual disposal (see below).<a id="page_91"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2a">Profit /loss on disposal</h2>
<p class="noindent">Residual values are <span class="italic">estimates</span> made by management <span class="italic">at the time an asset is acquired</span>. It is not uncommon therefore for the actual residual value at the end of an asset’s useful economic life to differ from management’s original estimates. This difference can result in the business recording a profit or loss on the eventual disposal or scrapping of the asset. In the example above, at the end of the 4-year period:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>If the actual residual value is more than £8,000 there will be a profit on disposal.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>If the actual residual value is less than £8,000 there will be a loss on disposal.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Any profit or loss on disposal is included under other operating income or expenses in the profit and loss account (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3 Profit and loss (P&amp;L)</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Revaluations</h2>
<p class="noindent">Accounting standards also give companies the option to <span class="italic">revalue</span> tangible fixed assets, rather than record them at their purchase cost.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a business chooses a policy of revaluing its tangible fixed assets, it must depreciate the revalued assets as well as keeping the asset valuations ‘up to date’ (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter17.xhtml">Chapter 17 Revaluation</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">TFA should be <span class="italic">capitalised</span> (‘recognised’) in the balance sheet as <span class="italic">assets</span> only when a company has the right to (and expects to) earn <span class="italic">economic benefits</span> from those assets. If a fixed asset does not yield benefits for a company over the long term, then it is not classified as an asset. Rather it must be classified as an <span class="italic">expense</span> and charged against profits. While fixed assets may typically be expected to be owned by a business, it is the <span class="italic">right</span> to earn economic benefits that determines whether they should be classified as fixed assets so legal ownership is not necessary. Leased assets, for example, are a category of assets that are <span class="italic">not owned</span> by a company. They are nevertheless capitalised <a id="page_92"></a>and recorded in the balance sheet (together with the corresponding lease liability) because the asset gives the right to the company to earn future benefits from the asset (see <span class="bold">Optional detail</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Most businesses, when they acquire (or construct) fixed assets, expect future benefits from those assets as they should not otherwise have invested in those assets. This does not always prove to be the case however. Consider a property business that redevelops a shopping centre over a number of years only to find that there is little or no demand from tenants for retail units at the time the units become available for rental. This change in demand may be due to changed market conditions that were not anticipated at the time of the original investment, e.g. the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting acceleration of online shopping.</p>
<p class="noindent">Investment in fixed assets therefore carries a risk and companies are required to assess whether their investment in fixed assets will continue generating future benefits. This <span class="italic">annual</span> assessment is known as an <a id="gloss-65" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_65"><span class="italic">impairment</span></a> test. Where there is evidence of impairment, the company must reduce the cost of each asset (or class of assets) that have been impaired to a lower amount, known as the <span class="italic">recoverable amount</span>. Any loss in value is reflected in the profit and loss account (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter18.xhtml">Chapter 18 Impairment</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">In practical terms, depreciation is calculated annually for every fixed asset held in the year. However, for assets purchased mid-point during a year, depreciation will usually be apportioned during the year of acquisition. For example, a company buying assets 3 months prior to its year end would charge only a quarter of the (annual) depreciation charge during the first accounting period. Mid-year asset purchases help to explain why the depreciation charge for a year may appear lower than would be otherwise expected.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Depreciation is subject to a number of judgements including choice of method, useful life and residual value. Companies have to exercise judgement in arriving at these estimates and their decisions will impact the reported financial results. Some companies may see this as an opportunity to manipulate reported performance.<a id="page_93"></a></p>

<p class="noindent">In practice, it is not uncommon to find companies continuing to utilise assets beyond the end of their estimated useful economic lives, i.e. after they have been fully depreciated. This may be evidence of an ‘aggressive’ depreciation policy. It may alternatively indicate a decision by management to improve the cash position of a business by delaying capital expenditure to purchase replacement assets.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that while changes in depreciation assumptions may be a way to boost reported performance, any changes should be disclosed in a company’s accounting policy note and be subject to scrutiny and approval both internally, e.g. by an audit committee (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter22.xhtml">Chapter 22 Corporate governance and whistleblowing</a></span>) and externally, by the company’s auditors (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20 External financial audit</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Alternative methods of depreciation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Several alternative methods exist including <span class="italic">reducing balance</span> and <span class="italic">sum of years’ digits</span>. The depreciation charge will vary according to the method chosen.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="italic">reducing balance</span> method calculates depreciation as a fixed percentage of an asset’s NBV every year. In contrast to the straight-line method, which charges the same annual amount, the depreciation charge will decline each year, as the net book value of the asset declines. In effect, this method results in higher depreciation in early years of an asset’s life with progressively lower depreciation charges in later years. This method is appropriate for assets that are used more in their early years, such as new cars or new vans.<a id="page_94"></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The sum of years’ digits method also charges a higher depreciation expense in the early years of an asset’s life, to reflect the reality that an asset is more productive in earlier years. This method of calculation is slightly more technical as it requires adding together the sum of the number of years the asset will be depreciated and then applying a reducing fraction of this sum to calculate the depreciation charge, starting in the first year with the highest sum digit.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, an asset purchased for £30,000 with a 5-year estimated life and nil residual value, is depreciated using the sum of digits method. Annual depreciation would be calculated as follows:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col class="colwidth30"/>

</table>
<p class="noindent">While management have discretion over the choice of method, the chosen method should nevertheless reflect the reality of how the asset is used. Office furniture for example is typically depreciated using the straight-line method as it is likely to be used evenly from one year to the next whereas motor vehicles may be used more in early years (when they are new) with their usage declining as the vehicles age suggesting that reducing balance or sum of years’ digits would be appropriate.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Cost of fixed assets</h2>
<p class="noindent">According to accounting standards, the ‘cost’ of fixed assets includes:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>cost of purchase, plus</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in a manner intended by management.<a id="page_95"></a></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Whereas costs such as ‘delivery’ and ‘installation’ may be easily identified as being necessary to ‘bringing the asset to the location and condition’, other related costs such as ‘training’ and ‘borrowing’ are not as clear cut.</p>
<p class="noindent">Training expenditure, for example, is usually an ongoing business cost and treated as operating expenditure (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7 Opex and capex</a></span>). However, certain training costs may be added to the cost of the asset, i.e. ‘capitalised’ and included as part of TFA, for example when the training is considered necessary to be able to operate the new asset.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, where an asset is financed by specific borrowing then the finance cost can also be capitalised as part of the cost of the asset rather than charged as an expense. The decision to categorise an item of expenditure as capital or expense impacts the profit and loss account and the balance sheet asset value (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7 Opex and capex</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Amortisation</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Depreciation</span> and <a id="gloss-7" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_7"><span class="italic">amortisation</span></a> can be regarded as synonymous concepts. Amortisation is to <span class="italic">intangible</span> assets what depreciation is to <span class="italic">tangible</span> assets. Tangible means physical in nature whereas intangible assets are non-physical. Examples of intangible assets include patents and licenses (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10 Goodwill and other intangibles</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2">Optional detail <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Optional.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Indefinite (or infinite) life assets</h2>
<p class="noindent">Freehold land is not depreciated. The concept of ‘usage’ or ‘wearing out’ over a period of time does not apply unless there is some aspect of the land that is actually used up, for example, minerals that can be extracted. Land is considered a unique tangible fixed asset that has an indefinite/infinite life.</p>
<p class="noindent">Goodwill is also a special class of intangible asset. It is not subject to amortisation as it is considered to have an indefinite life (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10 Goodwill and other intangibles</a></span>).<a id="page_96"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2a">Fixed versus current?</h2>
<p class="noindent">The classification between fixed and current assets may not always be obvious. Land and buildings could be equally classified as current or fixed depending upon business activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, a housebuilder is likely to sell rather than hold properties for the long term. Houses are therefore classified as ‘stock’ or work in progress (for assets still in the construction phase) and would be included under Current Assets in the balance sheet of a property developer (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11 Stock</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, if the same asset is owned by a property management company that intends to generate income from the asset over the long term, that same property would be classified as a fixed asset.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Leased assets</h2>
<p class="noindent">Balance sheets will include assets and liabilities even where the underlying assets are not owned by a company.</p>
<p class="noindent">With limited exceptions (see below), international accounting standards (IFRS 16) require leases to be capitalised and the corresponding liability recognised. This is the principle of economic substance over legal form (as the reality of leasing is that the lessee has the right of use over the asset although legally the lessor still actually owns the asset).</p>
<p class="noindent">The accounting treatment of leases results in the recognition of both an asset and a corresponding liability. The liability is an accounting calculation however, rather than an actual debt due at the balance sheet date.</p>
<p class="noindent">Leases of less than 12-months duration or low value asset leases however do not have to be capitalised and are expensed instead.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Fixed asset register (FAR)</h2>
<p class="noindent">A fixed asset register (FAR) is maintained by most businesses. It provides a written record (or database) that enables companies to keep track of the location of every fixed asset. The FAR records the <a id="page_97"></a>location of fixed assets physically present on premises as well as those held at third party locations. It will also include assets owned by the company but loaned or leased to others.</p>
<p class="noindent">The FAR also records the value of assets and can be used as a source document for the calculation of depreciation and tax calculations (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8 Business tax</a></span>).</p>

<p class="noindent">The accounting policy note will explain the treatment of fixed assets, including depreciation and revaluation policies.</p>
<p class="noindent">Contractual commitments to buy or construct fixed assets at the year end need to be separately disclosed in the ‘capital commitments’ note. This provides readers with information of the monies committed to the purchase of assets not yet in use by the company and an indication of future productive capacity and growth prospects.</p>
<p class="noindent">The profit and loss note will categorise depreciation under distribution costs or administration expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent">Tangible fixed assets are shown on the face of the balance sheet under fixed (or non-current) assets.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fixed asset note shows separately the carrying amount and accumulated depreciation for fixed assets and intangibles. Movements for the year are shown by category of asset.</p>

<p class="noindenta">Assets under construction relate to the building of an automated cold storage facility and the value of the assets will be recovered through the normal course of trade.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and provision is made where necessary. The method and assumptions used in these calculations, together with the associated sensitivities, are set out in the basis of preparation – key estimates and judgements on <a href="Chapter12.xhtml#page_123">page 123</a> and <a href="Chapter12.xhtml#page_124">124</a>.</p>
<p class="noindenta">During 2018, the Company exchanged contracts for the disposal of the vacant Twickenham site. The disposal is conditional on a number of factors, including the applications for and successful grant of planning permission. As at the end of 2020 the timing of the resolution of these factors remains uncertain and therefore this asset continues to be classified as non-current. At this stage the total proceeds arising from supply chain site disposals are still expected to be in line with those anticipated in the investment plan.</p>
