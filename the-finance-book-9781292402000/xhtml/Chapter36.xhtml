<p class="noindent">This chapter provides an opportunity to <span class="italic">consolidate</span> your understanding of finance and see how finance concepts are applied in practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">Each of the 35 chapters has its own set of questions designed to help <span class="italic">confirm</span> understanding of the key concepts covered. Answers are included immediately below each question denoted by the icon: <img src="../images/Icon-01.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="42"/></p>

<div class="chap2">
<img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Icon-01.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="42"/>
<p class="chaptit1">Accruals accounting helps a business to identify its actual profit and net worth. Company law and accounting standards require companies to use accruals accounting to reflect the substance, i.e. reality of what has happened. Cash accounting does not reflect the actual trading activity of a business.</p>
</div>
<div class="chap3">
<img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Icon-02.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="43"/>
<p class="chaptit2">Greggs plc’s financial statements are based on accruals accounting. The accounting policy note (immediately following the financial statements) confirms that Greggs plc follows international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The standards and the act both dictate the use of accruals accounting.</p>

<p class="chaptit1">Profit does not correlate to cash received and paid. The timing of cash receipts and payments is simply a settlement arrangement made between contracting parties that cannot alter the substance of the transaction. Instead profit correlates to actual trading activity of a business, under accruals accounting.</p>

<p class="chaptit2">The supporting note to Greggs plc’s cash flow statement illustrates the difference between profit and cash. The note shows that although Greggs plc reported a £13.0m loss in 2020, the net cash generated from operating activities was positive £61.6m. The main differences for Greggs plc in 2020 were depreciation and the decrease in payables.</p>

<p class="chaptit1">Offering credit to customers and receiving credit from suppliers does <span class="italic">not</span> directly impact a company’s profit (although the resulting impact on cash balances may have an indirect impact on profit).

<p class="chaptit"><a id="page_375"></a>Why is accruals accounting critical at the end of the financial year?</p>
</div>
<div class="chap2">
<img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Icon-01.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="42"/>
<p class="chaptit1">Accruals accounting should capture all sales during a financial year, including those that take place immediately prior to the year end, i.e. irrespective of whether or not cash for that sale is received in that year. Auditors will always be attentive to transactions around the year end to make sure they are reflected in the correct period. Large credit sales and credit purchases either side of the year end can have a significant impact on each year’s profit and therefore must be allocated to the correct year.</p>

<p class="chaptit1">The financial accounting team (often referred to as ‘finance’) is responsible for processing transactions and maintaining core accounting records. The purpose of financial accounts is to report the historic financial results of a company to shareholders as well as other internal and external stakeholders (such as employees and creditors).</p>
<p class="chaptit2">The management accounting (MA) team monitors budgets, produces forecasts and provides information to support financial decisions. The MA team uses the output from the finance system to prepare regular management accounting information.</p>
<p class="chaptit2">The purpose of management accounts is to help internal stakeholders, such as company directors, run a business efficiently and effectively. Frequent and regular financial information is needed to make informed business decisions and to understand if the business is on track to meet its plans.</p>

The level of detail depends on the size of company, its complexity and business requirements.</p>

<div class="chap2">
<img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Icon-01.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="42"/>
<p class="chaptit1">A balance sheet always balances because any profit or loss a company generates is reflected as an increase/decrease in net assets as well as a corresponding increase/decrease in shareholders equity. For example, where a company makes a profit, its net assets will increase by the amount of profit. Because this increase in profit belongs to shareholders, the shareholders equity will increase by the same amount to ensure the balance sheet balances. In fact, any change in net assets is mirrored by an equivalent change in shareholders funds, thus ensuring the balance sheet always balances.</p>

<p class="chaptit2">Note 1 of Greggs plc’s 2020 Annual Report itemises B2B revenue (franchise and wholesale activities) which in 2020 was £96.0m. As this is the only segment which receives credit it should be used as the denominator, with the trade receivables balance of £22.0m as the numerator. This gives an average ‘receivable’ collection period of 84 days (2019: 61 days).</p>
<p class="chaptit2">Greggs plc’s ‘cost of sales excluding exceptional items’ for 2020 was £299.6m. It is not known how much of this amount related to credit purchases and therefore the ratio may be understated. Using the trade payables balance of £48.8m as the numerator gives an average ‘payables’ payment period of 59 days (2019: 59 days).</p>
<p class="chaptit2">Note that the above ratios are approximations and may not reflect actual terms. Both revenue and cost of sales are annual figures, whereas the receivables and payables balances are taken at the year end, which may not be reflective of the whole year.</p>

Ian was first appointed to the Board in October 2011, and became Chair in May 2013. The Board recognises that by extending his tenure until that date, the Company will not be compliant with Provision 19 of the UK Corporate Governance Code which observes that the Chair should not remain in post beyond nine years from first appointment to the Board. The Board, led by the Senior Independent Director, is of the view that Ian remains fully committed, and it is right and proper that Ian remains in the Chair to oversee such a sensitive and critical recruitment.

<p class="chaptit2">Greggs plc’s gross profit margin (after exceptional items) for 2020 was 63% (2019: 65%). The fall was because the fall in revenue (30.5%) was greater than the fall in cost of sales (28.2%).</p>

<div class="chap2">
<img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Icon-01.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="42"/>
<p class="chaptit1">The drivers of operating profit margin are price and all operating costs, both direct and indirect (overheads).</p>
</div>
<div class="chap3">
<img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Icon-02.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="43"/>
<p class="chaptit2">As Greggs plc made a loss during 2020 (due to Covid-19) it makes more sense to look at the previous financial years.</p>
<p class="chaptit2">Historic operating profit margins for Greggs plc have been as follows:</p>
<ul class="box2">
<li class="box2"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>2019: 9.8%</li>
<li class="box2"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>2018: 8.0%</li>
<li class="box2"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>2017: 7.5%</li>
</ul>
<p class="chaptit2">Coupled with a consistent gross profit margin, this shows a trend of increasing profitability, as the revenue has grown faster than overheads.</p>
</div>
<div class="chap1">
<p class="chaptit"><a id="page_414"></a>Why does a change in gross or operating profit not always correlate with a change in gross or operating profit margin?</p>
</div>
<div class="chap2">
<img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Icon-01.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="42"/>
<p class="chaptit1">Gross and operating profit margins look at the relationship between revenue and gross profit/operating profit. They are expressed as a percentage.</p>
<p class="chaptit2">Gross and operating profit are absolute numbers expressed in currency, e.g. £.</p>
<p class="chaptit2">When gross and/or operating profit increase or decrease relative to revenue, this will cause a change in the respective margin. However, when gross and/or operating profit increase or decrease in direct proportion to revenue, the margins will remain the same.</p>
<p class="chaptit2">For example, if a company were to double its sales of a product, this would naturally increase both (absolute) revenue and gross profit. However, only if the (unit) price and cost of the product or service remained the same, would the gross profit margin also remain the same. In practice, discounts may apply at higher volumes which may affect the margin.</p>
<p class="chaptit2">Operating profit margin is less likely to move directly in line with revenue, as overheads tend to increase/decrease in steps. By their nature they are less likely to be variable. In practice, it is reasonable to assume some increase in overheads as volume increases.</p>
<p class="chaptit2">Reviewing both changes in margin and absolute numbers is necessary to understand business performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="chap3">
<img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Icon-02.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="43"/>
<p class="chaptit2">Between 2017 and 2018, Greggs plc’s revenue grew by 7%, however, its gross profit margin remained stable at 63%. This demonstrates a consistent margin, despite increased revenue and cost of sales.</p>
<p class="chaptit2">In the same period (2017 to 2018), Greggs plc’s operating profit grew by 14%, i.e. double the rate of growth of revenue. This explains the growth in operating profit margin from 7.5% to 8%. In other words, overheads did not increase in the same proportion as sales, which enabled Greggs plc to make a higher profit, both in terms of margin and absolute numbers.</p>

Cash-only businesses will purchase stock for cash in the expectation of selling that stock for cash. However, the period over which cash is tied up in stock should be monitored. Stock that is not sold ties up cash that might otherwise be deployed elsewhere.

<p class="chaptit1">A negative working capital cycle exists when a business receives cash from its sales before payment is due to suppliers. This gives the business an opportunity to use suppliers to finance the working capital needs of the business. Creditors offer payment terms which enable a business to buy stock and sell it for cash before settlement of the liability. This typically means that the business does not need to hold cash balances or facilities in reserve (e.g. an overdraft), although it is important to remember that cash from sales is still dependent on the timely sale of stock.</p>

<p class="chaptit2">There are two common methods of calculating gearing: ‘debt to equity’ and ‘debt to debt + equity’. Both methods can be calculated as a traditional ratio or a percentage.</p>
<p class="chaptit2">The higher the gearing, the riskier the business – in terms of both dilution of earnings to interest payments and sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates.</p>

<p class="chaptit1">For most businesses there is an inverse relationship between gearing and interest cover. Management will try and strike an appropriate balance between the two.</p>
<p class="chaptit2">Low interest rates will make it easier for businesses to achieve a comfortable level of interest cover and hence lead to higher levels of gearing.</p>

<p class="chaptit1">MAPs are typically produced monthly, although some companies may produce them more often, for example on a weekly, or even daily basis. Although technology has enabled more companies to move closer to the ideal of real-time information, monthly MAPs are still common and will include other relevant management information to be discussed at monthly board meetings. In addition, there is a difference between real-time data (which may just be numbers) and MAPs (which also include analysis and require professional judgement).</p>

<p class="chaptit1">When budgets and forecasts do not extend beyond the financial year end. As the year end approaches the future time horizon ‘shrinks’ and organisations have less visibility of what lies ahead. This issue can be overcome by using rolling budgets and/or forecasts which are continually extended at least 12 months ahead.</p>

<p class="chaptit1">To evaluate opportunities and see if their benefit is greater than their cost on an objective, rational basis. Investment appraisal enables organisations to compare investments of different sizes and times on a comparable basis. Investment appraisal also enables organisations to prioritise projects when capital is limited.</p>

<p class="chaptit1">The annual yield calculation is synonymous with other internal and external performance measures such as return on investment. This method of investment appraisal is therefore useful as it benchmarks potential investments against a company’s performance measures.</p>

<p class="chaptit1">Money is worth more today because there is an ‘opportunity cost’ of having money now, rather than having to wait to have it in the future. This ‘opportunity cost’ will depend upon the following factors, which can be unique to each business and its economic environment:</p>

<p class="chaptit2">Taking the example of a new Greggs shop: the future net returns will be the sales revenue generated, less the cost of products sold as well as staff costs, shop rent, heat, light and power etc. The investment will be the costs of fitting out the shop as well as the display cabinets, ovens, refrigerated cabinets etc. If the NPV is positive, then the new shop is likely to be a viable concern.</p>

<p class="chaptit2">In 2020, Greggs plc launched its multi-channel, digital transformation programme, which included a phone app. This is an example of a strategic initiative with many non-financial benefits. These were likely to play a large role in the investment decision. When the programme was launched (prior to Covid-19) it was not known ‘that it was about to become even more important’.</p>

</div>
<div class="chap2">

<p class="chaptit1">The IRR represents the ‘rate of return’ that an investment generates itself. It is expressed as a percentage and can be compared to an organisation’s cost of capital. If the IRR is greater than the cost of capital, then the investment is potentially worthwhile. If it is less, then the investment is likely to make a loss.</p>
<p class="chaptit2">IRR will usually provide the same decision as NPV, although it is important to be cautious when they provide different outcomes</p>
