<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta">An <a id="gloss-46" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_46"><span class="italic">external audit</span></a> is an independent examination of a company’s financial statements carried out annually by auditors. Auditors are qualified professionals, appointed by shareholders to provide an <span class="italic">independent</span> opinion on whether the financial statements present a <a id="gloss-117" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_117"><span class="italic">true and fair view</span></a>.</p>
<p class="noindenta">An audit gives shareholders confidence that the numbers reported in the balance sheet and profit and loss account are correct. Auditors must be independent of those who have responsibility for preparing the financial statements (directors) and have no vested interest in the performance or success of the business, for example through holding shares.</p>
<p class="noindenta">An unmodified audit report is issued to confirm that the financial statements are, in the opinion of auditors, true and fair.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Modified reports will highlight issues or concerns with the numbers and/or disclosures within the financial statements.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">All UK companies except dormant companies (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter21.xhtml">Chapter 21 Information in the public domain</a></span>) must prepare financial statements. However, not all these companies require an audit. As part of the government’s drive to reduce the administrative burden on business, companies that are ‘small’ are exempt from requiring an audit (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter21.xhtml">Chapter 21 Information in the public domain</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_196"></a>According to the Federation of Small Businesses, at the start of 2020, there were 5.94 million small businesses (with 0 to 49 employees) in the UK. This covers 99.3% of all private sector businesses. However, many of these small companies may still request an audit each year, even though they are not legally required to do so. Commercial requirements, imposed for example by banks as part of their lending criteria, may necessitate companies engaging auditors despite the legal exemption. Research commissioned by the government also reveals that there are still many businesses that are unaware that they are entitled to an exemption.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Why and when is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Wh-1.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="36"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">While an audit provides no guarantee that the numbers are correct, it gives credibility to financial statements by providing independent assurance on the numbers and disclosures.</p>
<p class="noindent">The audit report is prepared solely for a company’s shareholders (‘members’) as a body rather than any individual shareholder. Other interested parties known as ‘stakeholders’ (lenders, creditors, etc.) should note this scope limitation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Misunderstandings relating to the statutory audit are still commonplace and are collectively referred to as the ‘expectations gap’. This is the difference between what readers consider to be the purpose and remit of an audit and the reality. Some of the common misconceptions are covered below.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Fraud</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a id="gloss-53" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_53"><span class="italic">Fraud</span></a> is intentional deception with a view to gaining personal advantage.</p>
<p class="noindent">If company directors (or other employees) wish to perpetrate fraud by, say, hiding or manipulating transactions then they may have a good chance of success as the auditors may not be able to uncover carefully concealed frauds. Directors rightly have <span class="italic">primary</span> responsibility to report company results faithfully and are also responsible for preventing and detecting fraud and error in the company. Investors often wrongly believe that the auditors are responsible for fraud detection.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_197"></a>Auditors can, however, be held legally liable where they have actively conspired with company directors to defraud investors. They can also be sued for breach of contract where they have not carried out the audit properly and might otherwise been expected to spot significant fraud. Auditors may also face liability for negligence if they do not exercise due care in the conduct of the audit. As regulated professionals, they can also face disciplinary action by their professional body (e.g. ICAEW, ACCA) when they have failed to demonstrate competence and due care.</p>
<p class="noindent">Who is ultimately responsible or to what extent is an ongoing issue that resurfaces each time a major corporate fraud is uncovered. For example, in 2020, Wirecard, a German payment processor and financial services provider, filed for insolvency after the auditors refused to sign off the audit report on the company’s 2019 financial statements. The auditors (who were incumbent auditors over many years) accused their client of an elaborate and sophisticated fraud. However, the investor community pointed the blame at the auditors for failing to uncover discrepancies that should also have been apparent in earlier years. The German Finance Minister also raised concerns about the role of auditors and regulators in failing to uncover the fraud.</p>
<p class="noindent">This case is only one in a long list of corporate failures in which the role and effectiveness of audit has been questioned. In response to concerns, in 2021, the UK government launched a consultation on wide-ranging reforms aimed at modernising the UK’s audit and corporate governance regime. The Business Secretary set out the purpose of the consultation by stating that ‘major new reforms to the UK’s audit regime will aim to safeguard British jobs, avoid company failures and reinforce the UK’s reputation as a world-leading destination for investment’</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Errors</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Errors</span> (in contrast to fraud) are the result of <span class="italic">unintentional</span> mistakes. For example, a bookkeeper may inadvertently allocate a receipt to the wrong customer account.</p>
<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_198"></a>Reasonable assurance (not a guarantee)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Given the sheer number of transactions a typical business undertakes and the scope for directors to manipulate transactions, a statutory audit can only ever provide ‘reasonable assurance’ that the financial statements do not contain mistakes, i.e. an audit provides no <span class="italic">guarantee</span> against fraud or errors.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is in part because auditors typically only sample-check transactions when forming their opinions, which means that there is always a risk of errors remaining undetected. Consider, for example, the volume of transactions (loans, deposits, cash withdrawals, inter-branch and worldwide activity) relating to Barclays bank during the course of a single <span class="italic">day</span> (let alone a year!) and it should be quite clear why it would be impossible to check the authenticity of every transaction occurring at every branch of Barclays for the year.</p>
<p class="noindent">While today’s use of sophisticated programming tools and data analytics now enable audit firms to carry out audit testing over entire populations of data, the risk of fraud remains due to the inherent threat of deception by management.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Going concern</h2>
<p class="noindent">Financial statements are prepared on the presumption that a company will continue operating into the future. This is known as <a id="gloss-57" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_57"><span class="italic">going concern</span></a>. Going concern refers to a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Directors are required to review the period ahead to consider whether the company will be able to continue operating. Auditors, in turn, are required to consider whether the directors’ assessment is appropriate (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25 Insolvency and going concern risk</a></span>). However, as the future is never certain, this assessment should not be seen as providing a guarantee of the future financial health of the company. The impact of sudden or unforeseen external events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, cannot be anticipated. As events have shown, many businesses, including well-known high street names, were forced to cease trading within a short period of time, despite directors and auditors concurring that the business was a going concern only a few months earlier.</p>
<h2 class="h2"><a id="page_199"></a>A focus on the past (with very limited focus on the future)</h2>
<p class="noindent">An audit primarily focuses on checking transactions relating to <span class="italic">past</span> activity with only a limited focus on the future (i.e. going concern review). The financial statements are historic in nature, i.e. they report on what <span class="italic">has happened</span> rather than forecast what is <span class="italic">likely to happen</span>. The focus on historic performance enables auditors to obtain reliable and verifiable evidence to validate past transactions. Audits cannot for obvious reasons provide assurance about future performance, as there is no reliable evidence that can prove a future that has not yet happened.</p>
<p class="noindent">The auditor will, however, review the assumptions used by directors in arriving at their conclusion that the going concern basis of preparation is appropriate, based on the information available at that time. It is the responsibility of company directors to satisfy themselves that their strategy is appropriate and that the business is financed adequately to continue operating into the future (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25 Insolvency and going concern risk</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Banks, lenders, creditors, shareholders and investors place value on independently audited financial statements, despite the limitations of an audit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Banks, for example, will typically require audited company accounts as a pre-condition to advancing a loan and require annual audits for the duration of the loan agreement. Where an organisation is seeking to obtain new loan funding, a history of audited financial statements can provide the lender with a higher level of assurance than unaudited statements.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, where an investor is choosing between different potential companies to invest in, the company with a history of audited accounts may be assessed to be a more credible investment opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent">An independent review of the financial statements by an auditor will also provide some comfort to directors, especially where they have not been involved in the detailed preparation of the numbers. Accounts <a id="page_200"></a>are typically prepared by the company’s finance department so their review by an impartial auditor may highlight errors or system weaknesses that might otherwise have gone undetected.</p>
<p class="noindent">Companies looking to supply services to the public sector will likely go through a strict tender process, which includes a requirement to provide audited financial statements.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">True and fair</h2>
<p class="noindent">There is no formal definition of <span class="italic">true and fair</span> even though it is a legal term. It is interpreted to mean that the accounts are free from material misstatements and faithfully represent the historic financial performance and position of the entity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Determining whether financial statements are true and fair is ultimately a professional judgement left to auditors, although checking that the financial<a id="page_201"></a> statements comply with accounting standards and company law are relevant considerations.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Materiality</h2>
<p class="noindent">Materiality is a core concept in auditing. It helps the auditor to direct their effort towards identifying and testing significant transactions or account balances rather than all balances. It is also used to determine whether any discrepancies identified during the course of the audit need to be corrected or adjusted.</p>
<p class="noindent">A materiality level or threshold is set at the start of every audit. This is typically a numerical value related to the profit and assets of the business being audited. For example, a materiality threshold of <span class="italic">5% of profit before tax</span> may be set as a profit materiality level and <span class="italic">1% of total assets</span> as a balance sheet materiality level.</p>
<p class="noindent">Transactions or account balances larger than these numerical thresholds would be classified as material and therefore scrutinised by the auditor. In addition, where the auditor identifies an error greater than the materiality threshold, they will notify the directors that the financial statements should be adjusted to correct for the error. If the company refuses to adjust, the auditor would qualify their report (see below).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Internal audit</h2>
<p class="noindent">Larger companies typically have their own <span class="italic">internal audit</span> function. Internal audits differ in nature, purpose and scope to an external audit.</p>
<p class="noindent">The scope and purpose of an internal audit is determined by the company and work may be undertaken by staff employed by that company. The focus of internal audit typically includes testing (and making recommendations for improvements to) the company’s systems and controls, fraud investigations, and seeking efficiency improvements.</p>
<p class="noindent">External auditors, while not required to make use of the work of internal auditors, may seek to rely on their work, although this must be restricted to non-judgmental areas, i.e. areas considered low risk by the external auditor.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Optional detail <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Optional.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Audit modifications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Modifications arise in audit reports when the auditor does not agree with some aspect of the financial statements. Modifications depend on the nature of uncertainty or disagreement and the significance of the matter. The nature of the modification leads to different opinions, which are described further below as ‘qualifications’, ‘adverse’ or ‘disclaimer’ opinions.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Qualifications</h2>
<p class="noindent">With a qualified opinion the auditor is basically stating that there are, or could be, material (i.e. important or significant) misstatements, although these are confined to one or a few specific elements (e.g. numbers or disclosures) in the financial statements.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_202"></a>An auditor will issue a <span class="italic">qualification</span> in their audit report when there is:</p>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">Disagreement</span>: when the financial statements include a matter that does not comply with generally accepted accounting practice, although the rest of the financial statements are fairly stated. For example, if the accounts do not include the depreciation expense related to motor vehicles, the profit and loss account will overstate profit.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">Uncertainty</span>: where the auditor has been <span class="italic">unable</span> to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about a specific matter in the financial statements, although this limitation in scope does not apply to the rest of the audit. For example, if the auditor was unable to obtain sufficient evidence to confirm physical quantities of stock held by the business at its year end, there will be uncertainty over the stock balance included in the accounts (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11 Stock</a></span>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The auditor would issue a qualified opinion by including a ‘Basis for Modification’ section to the audit report to explain the matter(s) giving rise to the modification.</p>
<p class="noindent">The audit opinion paragraph will include the words ‘except for’ or ‘except for . . . might’, to highlight the disagreement or uncertainty in each specific area of the financial statements. These words are used to indicate that, except for the specific matters being referred to in the audit report, the financial statements give a true and fair view.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Adverse opinion</h2>
<p class="noindent">An adverse opinion is a severe (pervasive) form of disagreement and is issued when the disagreement is so significant that the financial statements as a whole are <span class="italic">not</span> true and fair. For example, where a company has prepared accounts on a going concern basis but the auditor has concluded that the basis of preparation is not appropriate, they will state in their opinion that the financial statements ‘do not give a true and fair view’.</p>
<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_203"></a>Disclaimer</h2>
<p class="noindent">A disclaimer is a severe (pervasive) form of uncertainty. It results in an auditor being unable to form an audit opinion. For example, where financial information has been destroyed or cannot be retrieved, the directors will be unable to provide the auditor with information and explanations they require to undertake the audit. In this situation, the auditor is unable to complete the audit and therefore does not express an opinion on the financial statements.</p>
<p class="noindent">If there is a management-imposed limitation on the scope of the audit that the auditor concludes could be pervasive, where practicable and possible under applicable law or regulation, the auditor should withdraw from that audit. This might arise, for example, where the directors refuse to provide information or explanations that the auditors require to undertake their work.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Going concern</h2>
<p class="noindent">(See also <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25 Insolvency and going concern risk</a></span>)</p>
<p class="noindent">Company accounts must include a statement setting out the directors’ judgements about the ability of the company to continue operating into the foreseeable future (at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements). Directors state whether it is considered appropriate to continue preparing the financial statements on a going concern basis.</p>
<p class="noindent">This statement is reviewed by auditors and referenced in the audit report. Where the auditor concurs with the directors’ disclosure, then there are no changes necessary to the audit report.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, where directors raise doubts about the viability of the business, they need to explain the uncertainty in the financial statements. For example, a company may be subject to a significant lawsuit and this could affect its future ability to continue in business. In this situation, the directors would be required to make further disclosures, including details of the lawsuit and its potential adverse impact on the continuity of the business. Where the auditor agrees with the adequacy and accuracy of these disclosures, the <a id="page_204"></a>audit report would be unqualified. However, it would contain an additional ‘emphasis of matter’ paragraph to highlight the existence of the uncertainty. The inclusion of this paragraph within the audit report is designed to draw the readers’ attention to the material uncertainty.</p>
<p class="noindent">Should the auditors <span class="italic">disagree</span> with the directors’ disclosures regarding going concern, they will issue an adverse opinion (see above).</p>

<p class="box2a-title2">Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement</p>
<p class="noindentsz">Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the accounts and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the accounts as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.</p>
