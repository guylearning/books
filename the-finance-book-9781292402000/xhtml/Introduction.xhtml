<p class="chap_title">Introduction</p>
<h2 class="h2">Why this book is different to other finance books</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">No prior knowledge is required</h2>
<p class="noindent">The book is purposefully designed to be quick and easy to use with no previous knowledge required to comprehend the concepts. We ‘tell you what you need to know’ to ‘get up to speed’ quickly in core finance concepts.</p>
<p class="noindent">A key feature of this book is that you do not have read it from cover to cover to make sense of finance. Each chapter covers a specific area. This enables you to dip in and dip out of chapters. Furthermore, we have taken otherwise complex topics and broken them down into key concepts that are explained in concise, easy-to-read sections.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Practitioners not academics</h2>
<p class="noindent">While not an academic book, this is also not a ‘simplistic’ book. It is a <span class="italic">practical</span> book because it has been written by practitioners. Included throughout this book are the authors’ first-hand personal experiences gained from working with organisations, across many industries and sectors, rather than replicating knowledge from academia.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, both authors have spent countless hours instructing, teaching and training thousands of professionals from disciplines including marketing, sales, production, engineering, IT, administration, HR, legal as well as accountancy.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Focused on business application</h2>
<p class="noindent">The overwhelming majority of available finance books immerse the reader in the ‘detail’. They are better suited to those who work or aspire to work <span class="italic">in finance</span>.<a id="page_xx"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The Finance Book</span> is written for non-finance people. It is aimed at those who work or aspire to work <span class="italic">in business</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">This book will help professionals in business or those thinking about a career in business including board directors, business managers, MBA students, graduates and undergraduates. It will also help <span class="italic">any reader</span> who wishes to understand key concepts in finance.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Your book, your journey</h2>
<p class="noindent">To make the book easy to read, we have used a consistent format across chapters. Within each chapter there are multiple cross references (and links) to other relevant chapters as they occur. This will enable you to review chapters and make connections relevant to you. Allow your curiosity to determine your path through the book.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Clear structure</h2>
<p class="noindent">Each chapter follows a consistent format to make the book easy to read.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Terminology</h2>
<p class="noindent">This book uses terminology in everyday use (such as ‘stock’ and ‘fixed assets’) to make the book readily accessible to non-finance professionals. Alternative terminology (e.g. ‘inventory’ and ‘non-current assets’ used in international accounting/ financial reporting standards (IFRS)) is introduced to show equivalence in practice (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>). For financial reporting treatment and disclosures we have used IFRS. This is consistent with Greggs plc, the example company used throughout this book.</p>
<p class="noindent">The terms ‘company’, ‘business’, ‘entity’ and ‘organisation’ are used interchangeably. There is no distinction in meaning intended by the authors in the use of these terms.</p>
