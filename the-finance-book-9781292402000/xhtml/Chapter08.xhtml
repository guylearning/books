<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta">The main activities which result in a business tax charge are:</p>

<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">This chapter provides a high-level overview of key business taxes. <span class="bold">Professional advice is always required for tax matters</span>. Taxation is a large and complex discipline; it is unique to each company and depends upon business structure. There are also differences between and within countries.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Tax is a significant business cost both in terms of monetary cost and the time involved in compliance and administration.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is a legal requirement to pay tax and keep detailed tax records. There are penalties for making mistakes or deliberate misstatements.<a id="page_76"></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The major taxes that a company is obliged to pay are as follows:</p>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span>Tax on profits</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span>Tax on capital gains</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">3</span><span class="pad1"></span>Employment taxes</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">4</span><span class="pad1"></span>Value added tax (VAT).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">1. Tax on profits</h2>
<p class="noindent">Although the profit and loss account is the official record of a company’s profit, the reported profit will often be different from the profit used to calculate tax. This is because certain expenses are not allowable deductions for tax purposes. Examples include:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>depreciation (see the <span class="bold">Nice to know</span> section below and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>formation and acquisition costs</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>donations to political parties</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>entertaining clients.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Accounting profit is also adjusted for:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>non-taxable income, for example government grants</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>tax allowances on certain asset purchases (see the <span class="bold">Nice to know</span> section below).</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Returns from investments, such as bank interest and dividends from other companies in which the business holds shares (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter16.xhtml">Chapter 16 Group accounts</a></span>), are also included in taxable profit.</p>
<p class="noindent">On an annual basis, the adjusted profit figure is multiplied by the ‘tax rate’ (19% in the UK at the time of publication) to arrive at the ‘tax charge’.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the UK, tax on a company’s profits is known as <a id="gloss-21" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_21"><span class="italic">corporation tax</span></a> (CT).</p>
<p class="noindent">Losses are covered in the <span class="bold">Nice to know</span> section below.<a id="page_77"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2a">2. Tax on capital gains</h2>
<p class="noindent">If a company sells an asset or investment for more than its original cost, it is subject to tax on the <a id="gloss-16" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_16"><span class="italic">capital gain</span></a> which arises.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the UK, the capital gain is calculated as the disposal proceeds less the following:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>the original cost</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>initial purchase-related costs</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>improvements and enhancement costs (but not repairs and maintenance)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>selling costs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The UK also allows the original cost to be adjusted for the effect of inflation. This is known as ‘indexation allowance’. However, this allowance cannot create or increase a capital loss. It can only reduce a gain.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the UK, capital gains for companies are taxed at the same tax rate as other profits.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a company replaces an asset, the capital gain on disposal of the original asset can be deferred until the replacement asset is disposed. This is known as ‘rollover relief’ in the UK.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a company makes a capital loss, it can only usually be set against gains of the current and future years. The relief available is therefore far more limited than for trading losses (covered in the <span class="bold">Nice to know</span> section below).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">3. Employment taxes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Employers act as tax collectors and deduct employees’ income tax and other <a id="gloss-19" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_19"><span class="italic">contributions</span></a> directly from their pay. This is subsequently paid across to tax authorities. In the UK, this system is known as <a id="gloss-94" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_94"><span class="italic">PAYE</span></a> (Pay As You Earn).</p>
<p class="noindent">The costs of administering the system are borne by employers.<a id="page_78"></a></p>
<p class="noindent">PAYE includes:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>income tax on cash payments such as basic pay, overtime, bonuses and commissions</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>income tax on non-cash items (benefits in kind) such as company cars and private health insurance</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>social security contributions towards state benefits such as public health services, pensions and welfare benefits. These are known as National Insurance Contributions (NIC) in the UK and are paid by both employees and employers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">4. Value added tax (VAT)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Value added tax (VAT) or sales tax is an indirect tax levied on the final consumer of certain goods and services.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the UK and most other OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, VAT is applied at multiple stages in the supply chain. In this system, every time a sale is made, VAT is charged (output VAT). However, a business can also claim back the VAT it has paid on purchases to make or sell the product (input VAT). The business pays back the difference to the tax authorities on a regular basis.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">VAT example</h2>
<p class="noindent">ABC Ltd sells furniture and buys its raw materials (such as wood, glue and nails) from XYZ Ltd. In a typical month, ABC purchases £50,000 of raw materials and sells £100,000 of furniture. This example uses a VAT rate of 20% (which is the standard rate of VAT in the UK at the time of publication).</p>

</table>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_79"></a>In this example, XYZ and ABC have both ‘collected’ and paid £10,000 of VAT. Both companies have added £50,000 of value. The difference is that ABC has deducted £10,000 of input VAT on its purchases to calculate the net £10,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The end ‘retail’ consumers of the furniture have paid the full VAT burden of £20,000. The £20,000 has been collected at two stages in the supply chain, when value has been added to the furniture.</p>
<p class="noindent">Therefore, in summary, VAT is not technically a cost to a business, as it can reclaim input VAT on its purchases. The business is merely a collecting agent on behalf of the tax authorities and suffers the costs of administering the system.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">VAT exceptions</h2>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span>Certain items (for example children’s clothing and books in the UK) are zero rated for VAT. This means that no output VAT is charged on sales, although input VAT can be reclaimed on purchases made to make those items.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span>Certain items (for example domestic fuel and mobility aids for the elderly in the UK) are taxable at different rates (e.g. 5%) from standard goods and services.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">3</span><span class="pad1"></span>Certain activities (for example charitable fundraising events and lottery ticket sales in the UK) are exempt from VAT. No output VAT is charged on sales and no related input VAT can be reclaimed on those activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">When are taxes important?</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are multiple deadlines for both reporting and paying tax. Penalties and interest may be charged for being late or reporting incorrect amounts.<a id="page_80"></a></p>

<h2 class="h2b">Tax evasion and avoidance</h2>
<p class="noindent">An example of tax evasion is where a business deliberately misrepresents its profits and as a result does not pay the rightfully payable tax. Tax evasion is subject to substantial penalties.<a id="page_81"></a></p>
<p class="noindent">‘Tax avoidance’ is the use of legal methods to reduce the amount of tax payable. This is usually achieved by claiming permissible tax deductions and tax credits. Tax authorities can introduce anti-avoidance legislation if they become aware of many businesses using perceived legal loopholes.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <a id="gloss-115" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_115"><span class="italic">tax gap</span></a> is a measure of the difference between the amount of tax collected by a country’s tax authorities and the amount that should be collected. For the tax year ending April 2020, the HMRC estimated that the tax gap was £35 billion, which is 5.3% of the total tax owed.<sup><a href="Chapter08.xhtml#fn2" id="rfn2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent">The HMRC also measures the additional amount it generates by tackling tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance, known as the compliance yield. Closing the tax gap and increasing the compliance yield is a continual goal for the HMRC.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Capital allowances</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the UK, businesses deduct <a id="gloss-13" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_13"><span class="italic">capital allowances</span></a> instead of depreciation (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation</a></span>) to calculate taxable profit. Capital allowances are similar in principle to depreciation, in that they apportion the cost of an asset over its life. Whereas depreciation policy is chosen by a company, there is no discretion over capital allowances, which use specific tax rules.</p>
<p class="noindent">Capital allowances are typically permitted on assets such as machinery, computer equipment and certain items in buildings or costs related to buildings, although not usually on land or the buildings themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent">To encourage investment, accelerated capital allowances (for example a 100% first-year allowance) are allowed on certain assets such as environmentally friendly vehicles.<a id="page_82"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2a">Tax relief for losses</h2>
<p class="noindent">If a company makes a loss instead of a taxable profit, no tax is payable for that particular year and a tax relief is created. The UK offers the following reliefs for trading losses:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>carry the loss forward against future trading profits of the same trade</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>offset the loss against other income or capital gains of the same period</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>carry the loss back against profits of previous periods</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>offset the loss against the profits of another group company (‘group loss relief’) (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter16.xhtml">Chapter 16 Group accounts</a></span>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Optional detail <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Optional.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">International taxation</h2>
<h2 class="h2b">Residence</h2>
<p class="noindent">Globalisation and the growth in multinational corporations, with operations in multiple countries, have increased the relevance of international taxation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Companies pay tax on their worldwide income to the country in which they are ‘resident’ for tax purposes. Residence is determined by a company’s:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Place of incorporation (domicile)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Place of effective management and control</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Place of permanent establishment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">To be resident a company must demonstrate that a degree of trade is undertaken or decisions are made in a particular country. A warehouse on its own, for example, is simply a storage area. A registered office does not mean that actual office work takes place.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Double taxation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Where a company is resident in two (or more) countries, it is potentially subject to tax in both those countries and could theoretically suffer <a id="gloss-38" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_38"><span class="italic">double taxation.</span></a><a id="page_83"></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The OECD suggests that a company can only have one place of effective management, which is where it should be deemed resident and pay tax. The place of effective management is:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>The place where key management and commercial decisions are made</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>The place where the board or senior management meets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Most countries have established double tax treaties with their international trading partners. These treaties determine which country will tax profits and the methods of double tax relief for companies which trade in both countries.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, dividends are paid from post-tax profits, i.e. they will have already ‘suffered’ tax in the paying country. When a parent company receives a dividend from a foreign subsidiary, the dividend must be included in the parent company’s income and once again be taxed, this time in the receiving parent company’s country of residence (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter16.xhtml">Chapter 16 Group accounts</a></span>). Depending on the country and treaty, double tax relief is often available for the overseas tax paid.</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision to establish an overseas subsidiary (a separate legal entity) or simply a branch, may be influenced by the ‘local’ tax rate and the respective double tax treaty.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Deferred tax</h2>
<p class="noindent">Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which arises because the accounting treatment of a transaction is different from the tax treatment. It is essentially a temporary timing difference. See the extract from Greggs plc 2020 annual report and accounts for an example.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Effective tax rate</h2>
<p class="noindent">The effective tax rate is the rate of tax paid based on accounting profits, as opposed to taxable profits. This gives a more accurate picture of a company’s tax liability than a country’s headline tax rate. See the extract from Greggs plc 2020 annual report and accounts for an example.<a id="page_84"></a></p>

<h2 class="h2">Where to spot in company accounts <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Search.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Tax can be found in both the profit and loss account (the current year’s tax charge) and balance sheet (the amount of tax owed to tax authorities). This will usually be supported by detailed notes to explain any adjustments made in calculating the tax charge and liability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Employers’ contributions to NI (or equivalent) are usually detailed in the note under employment costs.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Extract from Greggs plc 2020 annual report and accounts</h2>
<p class="noindent">In Greggs plc’s annual report, the supporting tax notes calculate an effective tax rate. Greggs plc’s effective tax rate for 2020 was 5.2% (2019: 19.7%). The 2020 rate was lower due to Greggs plc making a loss. In the associated ‘financial review’ the effective rate was forecast to be 1.5% above the headline rate of 19% in future years, mainly due to non-deductible expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent">Greggs plc’s 2020 annual report shows a net ‘deferred tax’ liability. For Greggs plc this is mainly due to capital expenditure and employee benefits.<a id="page_85"></a></p>
