<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="gloss-69" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_69"><span class="italic">Insolvency</span></a> is a <span class="italic">legal</span> term used to describe the situation where a company is unable to repay the debts that it owes. This can lead to insolvency proceedings, in which legal action is taken against the entity, and assets are liquidated to pay off outstanding debts.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="italic">Going concern</span> is an <span class="italic">accounting</span> concept used to describe a state of operational continuity for a business. The going concern presumption, applied when preparing financial statements, is that a company can continue to operate into the foreseeable future with no intention or need to stop trading.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Going concern and insolvency are interrelated. An insolvent company is not a going concern.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Most businesses will owe money, whether through borrowing from banks or taking advantage of short-term credit terms, available when buying goods or services from suppliers. A company that can pay its liabilities, as and when they fall due, can be described as a going concern. Every company should keep a sharp and continuous focus on its cash position to ensure it can meet its financial obligations as they fall due (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management</a></span>). However, as recent history shows, even well-established companies can find themselves in a position <a id="page_252"></a>without readily available cash when it is required. As a result, businesses can find themselves at risk of insolvency.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Insolvency can affect a wide range of stakeholders including shareholders, creditors, employees, pensioners, customers and government.</p>
<p class="noindent">Creditors will suffer financial losses when a company has insufficient assets to meet its liabilities. Shareholders, who carry the highest risk as they are the last to be repaid, will lose monies they have invested in the business (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter29.xhtml">Chapter 29 Equity finance</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Employees may lose their jobs and may not receive redundancy payments, or they may suffer from pension deficits due to a company’s inability to make good pension liabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent">Customers are also likely to be affected. For example, when Debenhams announced on 1 December 2020 that it was to close, customers who were in possession of gift cards were given only one month to use their cards, as the business ceased to accept them after 31 December 2020.</p>
<p class="noindent">Government may lose out due to the company’s inability to pay statutory taxes owed.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Whenever there is a <span class="italic">risk</span> of insolvency, directors are legally required to protect the interests of creditors. This is to prevent what may already be a bad financial situation from potentially becoming worse. Directors have a legal obligation to ensure that the company does not continue to trade if it is insolvent.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Warning signs</h2>
<p class="noindent">A company’s directors have a legal duty to ‘promote the success of the company’ and should ensure they have access to information to make informed decisions. This includes identifying warning signs that indicate the risk of insolvency. They must act where there is any risk of insolvency.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_253"></a>Warning indicators can give directors the time needed to secure alternative sources of cash, change strategy or the business model.</p>
<div class="nobox">
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Early warning signs of insolvency may include:</span></p>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span>Persistent losses being incurred.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span>Overdue tax payments (PAYE, National Insurance, corporation tax, VAT (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8 Business tax</a></span>)).</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">3</span><span class="pad1"></span>Existing or new creditors placing the company on ‘cash on demand’ terms.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">4</span><span class="pad1"></span>Frequent switching of suppliers (existing suppliers unwilling to continue supply until debts settled).</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">5</span><span class="pad1"></span>Creditors remaining unpaid beyond agreed terms (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management)</a></span>.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">6</span><span class="pad1"></span>Finance department issuing post-dated cheques.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">7</span><span class="pad1"></span>Growing or worsening working capital cycle (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management</a></span>).</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">8</span><span class="pad1"></span>Low liquidity ratio (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management</a></span>).</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">9</span><span class="pad1"></span>Inability to borrow additional funds from existing lenders, e.g. because of deteriorating relationships or perceived higher risk.</li>
<li class="numd"><span class="ash1">10</span><span class="pad1"></span>Inability to secure alternative sources of finance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Not knowing the company’s trading performance and financial position on a timely basis, for example due to disorganisation or poor quality of financial information, can exacerbate the problem. Directors should implement procedures to ensure they have access to financial information on a timely basis, so they are up-to-date and fully informed on how the company is trading (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter31.xhtml">Chapter 31 Management accounts</a></span>). Detailed <span class="italic">cash flow forecasts</span> can often provide the best early warning indicator of whether (and when) additional cash will be required by the business. They can also signal a need to adapt or change strategy to ensure business survival over the longer term.</p>
<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_254"></a>Legal support</h2>
<p class="noindent">Where there is a risk of insolvency, legal advisers will need to be engaged, to advise directors of the actions that need to be taken to protect creditors as special rules come into force.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Assessing going concern and solvency</h2>
<p class="noindent">A company’s audited financial statements cannot and should not be relied on to provide a guarantee of company solvency (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20 External financial audit</a></span>). Financial statements provide a picture of the company’s <span class="italic">historic</span> financial performance and situation, of what <span class="italic">has been</span> rather than what <span class="italic">will be</span>. Financial statements provide limited disclosures and give little, if any, assurance about the future prospects of a business. </p>
<p class="noindent">Directors are required to include a <span class="italic">going concern</span> statement setting out their judgements about the company’s ability to continue operating into the ‘foreseeable future’ (a period defined as being at least 12 months after the date the financial statements are approved).</p>
<p class="noindent">While the going concern statement is intended to provide some comfort of future continuity, it offers <span class="italic">no guarantee</span> of longevity because of the uncertain nature of the future. The Covid-19 pandemic, for example, has shown how quickly a situation can develop and the devastating impact that this can have.</p>
<p class="noindent">The statutory requirement to report financial information only once annually provides shareholders and stakeholders (such as suppliers) with limited information to assess future solvency. This limitation is compounded by the time taken to publish financial information, anything up to 9 months after the company’s year end (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter21.xhtml">Chapter 21 Information in the public domain</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth noting that the <span class="italic">extent</span> of disclosure around going concern and solvency also varies according to the type of company.</p>
<p class="noindent">Public limited companies (listed PLCs) are required to disclose additional information about their longer-term viability (see viability statement, below) and include details of the sources of <a id="page_255"></a>finance available to the company. Private limited companies, by contrast, are required to provide very little information that could be considered useful in assessing their solvency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of these limitations, creditors are likely to turn to credit rating agencies to determine whether to extend credit, or impose alternative trading terms such as ‘cash on delivery’ to eliminate credit risk.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Company insolvency is not always apparent and cannot easily be predicted. Directors, expected to be continually on alert for risks of insolvency, are often remote from day-to-day business activity. In law, not knowing is not an excuse.</p>
<p class="noindent">The pace of business change can often take even the most diligent directors by surprise. For example, the emergence of disruptive technologies and their deployment by companies such as Netflix has created significant business challenges (and new opportunities) for long-established, typically high fixed cost, businesses such as Disney and Universal.</p>
<p class="noindent">External or environmental shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic could not have been foreseen, yet the effects on business continuity have been both dramatic and quick. Many businesses that have survived have done so by seeking additional and timely financial support or have been able to adapt their business models quickly to survive.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">There are two types of insolvency:</p>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">Balance sheet insolvency</span> (referred to as <span class="italic">technical</span> insolvency). This is when a company’s <span class="italic">total</span> liabilities exceed its <span class="italic">total</span> assets. A company with positive net assets may suffer losses in one or more years. These losses will deplete the asset base year on year until technical insolvency occurs. In this situation, any <a id="page_256"></a>attempt to settle the account of any one creditor may prejudice repayment of other creditors because there are insufficient assets remaining to repay <span class="italic">all</span> creditors.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">Cash flow insolvency</span> (referred to as <span class="italic">actual</span> insolvency) is the situation where a company has insufficient <span class="italic">cash</span> to repay its debts as they fall due. In cash flow insolvency the company may have sufficient assets but the problem is that it has insufficient <span class="italic">liquid</span> assets (i.e. cash) to meet its liabilities. A business expanding rapidly and not collecting cash from its customers quickly enough may find that it cannot meet supplier payments, even though it is trading profitably. This is known as overtrading (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management</a></span>)<span class="bold">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">It is possible for a company to be cash flow <span class="italic">insolvent</span> while remaining balance sheet <a id="gloss-109" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_109"><span class="italic">solvent</span></a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In either of the above insolvency situations, however, the company may be placed into what is known as a <span class="italic">formal insolvency procedure.</span></p>
<h2 class="h2">Optional detail <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Optional.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Insolvency procedures</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the UK, any creditor owed more than £750 and not paid for three weeks after the due payment date can instigate a ‘winding up petition’ (a legal notice put forward to the court by a creditor) to place the company into a ‘formal insolvency procedure’. This could result eventually in the <span class="italic">winding up</span> of the company.</p>
<p class="noindent">An insolvent company can be managed in (one of) three ways depending on its likelihood of survival:</p>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span><a id="page_257"></a>Company Voluntary Arrangement</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span>Administration</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">3</span><span class="pad1"></span>Liquidation</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2b">1 Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)</h2>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Where there is an intention to keep the business operating.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Carried out under the supervision of an appointed Insolvency Practitioner.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Directors continue to run and retain control of the business.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Creditors agree to a reduced (or rescheduled) debt payment in return for a commitment by the company to restructure under a new business strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The logic for creditors accepting a CVA is that by keeping the business going, there may be some hope of recovering the monies at risk.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">2 Administration</h2>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Alternative under which a qualified Insolvency Practitioner (‘the Administrator’) takes control and attempts to rescue the company in the interests of all creditors.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Directors lose control of the business.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>If nothing can be done to rescue the company, the Administrator will wind up the company and distribute the assets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2b">3 Liquidation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Liquidation is the process designed to close down the company (cease trading) by converting all of the company’s remaining assets into cash.</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Assets are broken up, sold off and distributed to creditors.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Adopted if there is no realistic prospect of rescuing the business.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">Viability statement disclosure</h2>
<p class="noindent">The viability statement was introduced following the 2008 financial crisis to provide investors with a better view of the <span class="italic">longer-term</span> prospects and solvency of a business. The UK Corporate Governance Code includes a requirement for directors to include a viability <a id="page_258"></a>statement in the annual report, to strengthen the focus of companies and investors on the longer-term business model. Directors are required to consider an appropriate time period (more than a year) when reporting to shareholders to explain the prospects for the company and the reasons why they consider the company will continue to be viable (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter22.xhtml">Chapter 22 Corporate governance and whistleblowing</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Given the heightened uncertainties brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, directors are now encouraged to provide fuller disclosure to support their viability assessment by clearly explaining the <span class="italic">company’s specific circumstances</span> and the <span class="italic">degree of uncertainty</span> that they face.</p>
<p class="noindent">The viability statement should be reviewed by auditors and referenced in the audit report.</p>
<p class="noindent">Providing detailed disclosures covering both going concern and viability is intended to provide investors and other stakeholders with insight into the future prospects of business, in the short and longer term.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Reflect and embed your understanding <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Reflect.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="36"/></h2>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span>Obtain the annual report and financial statements of a plc company in which you have an interest (<a href="http://gov.uk">gov.uk</a> and search for Companies House). Consider the following:

<li class="alphan"><span class="ash1">a</span><span class="pad1"></span>What disclosures have been included relating to going concern? What evidence did the directors use to assure themselves that the business would be likely to continue in operation for the next 12 months?

<li class="alphan"><span class="ash1">b</span><span class="pad1"></span>Read the viability statement. How did directors assess the company’s viability?

<p class="noindent">Going concern disclosures are included in the financial statements, typically within the ‘basis of preparation’ note (under accounting policies) and explained in the governance section of the annual report and accounts.</p>
<p class="noindent">In arriving at their assessment of going concern, directors should make sufficient disclosure to support that assessment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The viability statement is typically located within the governance section of the annual report and accounts.</p>
<p class="noindent">The validity of the going concern and viability statement and related disclosures should be reviewed by auditors and referenced within the audit report (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20 External financial audit</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_260"></a>Extract from Greggs plc 2020 financial statements Appendix <a href="Appendix.xhtml#page_451">p. 451</a></h2>
<div class="box2">
<p class="noindents">The Directors have considered the adoption of the going concern basis of preparation for these accounts in the context of the continued uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on the trading performance of the Group. At the end of the reporting period the Group had available liquidity comprised of cash and cash equivalents plus an undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF) (which is committed to December 2023) totalling £106.8 million. The RCF covenants relate to maximum borrowing levels and minimum liquidity for the 2021 financial year, thereafter they relate to maximum leverage and a minimum fixed charge cover. How these covenants are measured and the required ratios are set out in Note 2.</p>
<p class="noindents">In 2020 it was necessary to protect the cash position of the Group whilst the additional credit facilities were put in place. Dividends and capital expenditure were temporarily stopped along with any non-essential expenditure. Government support for job retention was accessed and the Company benefitted from business rate relief.</p>
<p class="noindents">The Directors have reviewed cash flow forecasts – which include severe but plausible downsides – prepared for a period of 12 months from the date of approval of these accounts as well as covenant compliance for that period.</p>
<p class="noindents">The forecasts assume that:</p>
<ul class="dash">
<li class="dash">–<span class="pad1"></span>the Covid-19 pandemic requires two months of further lockdown restrictions in November 2021 and February 2022, during which the Company continues to trade as it has done during the most recent periods of lockdown restrictions (i.e. its shops remain open albeit trading at reduced levels);</li>
<li class="dash">–<span class="pad1"></span>there is a gradual recovery in sales levels outside of the restricted periods, which the Group has modelled based on experience in the second half of 2020;</li>
<li class="dash">–<span class="pad1"></span>no further government support is utilised (including for periods where continued availability of support has already been announced);</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindents">In this scenario the Group is able to operate without needing to draw on its existing committed lending facility and without taking mitigating actions such as reducing capital expenditure and other discretionary spend.</p>
<p class="noindents">The Directors further considered a more severe scenario where the Group suffers from a brand-damaging food scare resulting in a significant sales reduction in addition to the downside assumptions described above. In this scenario the Group would take mitigating actions in respect of capital expenditure and other discretionary spend. This forecast scenario shows a possible requirement to draw on the RCF but no breaches of the covenants linked to it.</p>
<p class="noindents">After reviewing these cash flow forecasts and considering the continued uncertainties and mitigating actions that can be taken, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. After making enquiries, the Directors are confident that the Company and the Group will have sufficient funds to continue to meet their liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.</p>
