<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="italic">Equity finance</span> is money (‘capital’) raised by the sale of shares to investors (shareholders) who become owners with voting rights in the company, in return for their investment.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Equity is typically a more expensive way to finance a business because shareholders require high rewards as compensation for risk. Shareholders suffer the highest risk because there is never a guarantee of return and no security is provided in return for the capital invested.</p>
<p class="noindenta">It is the <span class="italic">expectation</span> of growth in value of shares and/or the prospect of receiving a regular income (dividends) that provides the attraction for equity investors.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Equity finance also gives a right to influence company strategy because shareholders have voting rights. In practice, however, most investors rarely exercise their rights (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter22.xhtml">Chapter 22 Corporate governance and whistleblowing</a></span>).</p>

<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Equity finance carries no financial risk to a company because it carries no obligation to pay an income or to repay capital. However, to raise equity finance, the existing owners must give up at least <a id="page_300"></a>some of their ownership in the company, by transferring existing shares (or issuing new shares) to incoming investors. Investors who obtain equity shares become part owners in the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">For some companies, equity finance may be the <span class="italic">only</span> viable option for raising finance. The 2007/2008 financial crisis, for example, made it difficult for companies, in particular smaller entities, to access debt finance because banks were unwilling to lend.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>

<p class="noindent">Deciding <span class="italic">how</span> to finance a company may be a critical decision for most businesses. This decision, known as financial strategy, should not be taken lightly as it can significantly influence a company’s prospects of survival or prosperity.</p>
<p class="noindent">The choice between seeking <span class="italic">debt</span> finance or <span class="italic">equity</span> finance is not always straightforward.</p>
<p class="noindent">Debt finance offers tax advantages as interest is a business expense and therefore tax deductible. However, debt <span class="italic">must</span> be serviced and repaid and therefore increases the company’s level of financial risk (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter30.xhtml">Chapter 30 Debt finance</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Most companies will need money at some stage of the business <span class="italic">life cycle</span>, i.e. from ‘birth’ to ‘death’. The availability of finance may differ depending on the stage of the cycle.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Incorporation and growth</h2>
<p class="noindent">In its early stages a business will find it difficult to access debt finance, as it is unlikely to be generating sufficient, reliable cashflows to meet debt repayments. It is also unlikely to have sufficient assets to offer as security to a lender.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_301"></a>Equity finance may therefore be the only source of finance available for early-stage growth companies. Entrepreneurs, however, as owners, are often very reluctant to cede control. Although unappealing, equity finance may be the only realistic way to raise capital for a new business, especially where it has no track record of profitability and little asset security.</p>
<p class="noindent">Start-up businesses are seen as particularly high risk, as they do not have an established market presence, and are unlikely to have the people, systems and processes in place to manage business growth effectively. Early-stage equity investors, referred to as ‘angel investors’ (see the <span class="bold">Nice to know</span> section below), are likely to demand a significant shareholding in the business in return for capital invested, as well as a seat on the board to enable greater oversight over their investment.</p>
<p class="noindent">For the investor, equity finance is a trade-off between the rights to <span class="italic">uncertain</span> (yet potentially significant) profits and cash flows in future, in return for <span class="italic">certain</span> cash invested today.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Expansion and maturity</h2>
<p class="noindent">Once established, a successful business may have built up its financial resources by retaining its profits <span class="bold">(</span>see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15 Capital and reserves</a></span>). However, to grow and expand further or faster, the company may require more finance than it can generate through profits alone.</p>
<p class="noindent">At this stage of the life cycle, having a strong asset base with a track record of positive cash flows and profits will make it easier (and often cheaper) to attract additional equity finance and may also make debt finance a realistic alternative. In the eyes of lenders, equity-only financed companies are seen as ‘safer’ companies because they have no pre-existing debt finance, i.e. they will have no (or low) interest commitments relative to companies financed through debt (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter26.xhtml">Chapter 26 Long-term solvency performance measures</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Established companies may prefer to take on debt at this stage of the cycle. Debt is a cheaper form of finance and <span class="italic">financial leverage</span> (also known as ‘trading on equity’) can be used as a strategy to magnify shareholder returns (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter30.xhtml">Chapter 30 Debt finance</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter26.xhtml">Chapter 26 Long-term solvency performance measures</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_302"></a>Cessation (‘death’)</h2>
<p class="noindent">A company with debt carries a higher risk of becoming insolvent than an equity-only financed business, because debt is a liability that <span class="italic">must be</span> serviced and repaid. Interest must be paid on debt and debt holders must be repaid their invested capital when repayment is due. Where a company has insufficient cash to meet those obligations, it may be forced into insolvency (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25 Insolvency and going concern risk</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">The cost of equity is dependent on several factors, including risk and liquidity. Listed PLCs, for example, can raise equity finance more cheaply than private companies because their shares can be bought and sold on a stock exchange. The lack of a ‘market’ for trading in a private company’s shares restricts its <span class="italic">liquidity</span> and therefore increases <span class="italic">risk</span> for the investor. Listed companies are also perceived to be lower-risk investments, because they are subject to greater scrutiny including being required to publish extensive information (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter21.xhtml">Chapter 21 Information in the public domain</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">A particular challenge for private companies seeking to raise equity finance is how to determine a fair price for their shares. Valuation may require independent professional advice, which is an added cost and therefore may act as a barrier to raising such finance. New or existing shareholders can also be unwilling to invest further because of uncertainties over the existing worth of the business (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter28.xhtml">Chapter 28 Business valuation</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Private companies – sources of equity finance</h2>
<p class="noindent">For non-listed businesses, the most common source of raising equity finance is the owner/entrepreneur (or immediate family and friends).</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_303"></a>For businesses with high growth potential, possible alternative sources of equity include angel investors (or ‘business angels’), equity crowdfunding or venture capital.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Angel investors (business angels)</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a id="gloss-8" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_8"><span class="italic">Angel investors</span></a> are wealthy individuals who invest their own capital in early-stage companies in return for an equity stake in the business. A condition of any investment is typically a seat on the board, as they expect to play an active role in the business. The owner may also be expected to invest new capital, as this is considered by some angels as a strong motivator to ensure the business succeeds.</p>
<p class="noindent">Angel investors typically look to invest for periods of between three to eight years. Angels expect to invest in opportunities that enable them to at least double their investment and typically invest up to £50,000 in a startup.</p>
<p class="noindent">One benefit of angel investors is that they are often a good source of free advice because they tend to be entrepreneurs or executives with considerable experience or extensive business contacts.</p>
<p class="noindent">The challenge for the company seeking finance is finding an angel that ‘fits’ with the business and its ambitions. This search can take up valuable time that would otherwise be spent developing the business.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Equity crowdfunding</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a id="gloss-42" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_42"><span class="italic">Equity crowdfunding</span></a> is a relatively recent development (from around 2010). Like other types of equity finance, crowdfunding involves offering shares in return for funding. A key difference, however, is that investors are sought through online platforms. Such platforms enable entrepreneurs to present their businesses through video pitches, literature, Q&amp;A etc.</p>
<p class="noindent">Crowdfunding platforms enable entrepreneurs to deal with multiple investors as a single investor. This avoids the time, cost and effort of having to manage many investors individually. </p>
<p class="noindent">UK equity crowdfunding platforms are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Crowdcube and Seedrs are examples of equity <a id="page_304"></a>platforms that typically list businesses seeking to raise from £100,000 to £1 million plus.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Venture capital (VC)</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a id="gloss-120" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_120"><span class="italic">Venture capital (VC)</span></a> firms are typically set up as partnerships in which partners serve as managers of the firm. They invest monies raised from institutional investors (insurance companies, pension funds, etc.), and wealthy individuals (including their own monies). They are usually well publicised, so are a more visible source of finance than angel investors. They typically buy minority stakes in businesses and expect a seat on the board. VCs make money through selling at a higher price to another company or exiting through the stock market (via an ‘IPO’, see below). It is not unusual for VCs to invest from £2m to £50m in startups.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Private equity</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a id="gloss-98" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_98"><span class="italic">Private equity</span></a> (PE) usually refers to organisations that raise funds to ‘buyout’ shareholders of existing companies, rather than providing a source of new finance for expansion for companies.</p>
<p class="noindent">Depending on the nature of the deal, PE firms, such as The Carlyle Group, KKR, Blackstone, etc., will seek to buy up to 100% of the shares in an established. yet underperforming, company.</p>
<p class="noindent">PE firms are, however, unlikely to finance the acquisition entirely through new equity finance. Rather, they predominantly use debt finance to buy out existing owners. This is termed leveraged buyout (LBO).</p>
<p class="noindent">The PE firm strategy is to manage a company better than existing management. Incumbent management teams are typically replaced by PE appointed industry experts. The business is then streamlined, e.g. by disposing of non-core assets or reducing the workforce. The focus is on growth and profitability.</p>
<p class="noindent">High-profile examples of private equity investments have included the acquisition of Boots plc (pharmacies) by KKR in 2007 and Learndirect (the UK’s largest provider of apprenticeships and employment services) in 2011 by LDC (Lloyds Development Capital). <a id="page_305"></a>A more recent example is the acquisition of ASDA by TDR capital (and the billionaire Issa brothers) in 2020. It is reported that just 12% of the purchase price was financed with new equity in the ASDA LBO (compared to a market average of 50% equity).</p>
<p class="noindent">Refinancing the business through PE typically results in a company with more debt (gearing) and a higher commitment to meet interest payments, leaving less money available to invest in the growth of the business. Some argue that the PE financing model has been responsible for the collapse of many high street names, including Toys ‘R’ Us (2018) and Debenhams (2020).</p>
<p class="noindent">PE firms seek to realise their investments through an IPO or trade sale, e.g. to a competitor.</p>
<p class="noindent">PE firms are funded by institutional investors and high net-worth individuals. The minimum amount of capital required can vary depending on the firm and fund. Some funds have a £250,000 minimum entry requirement, while others can require millions.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Public companies – other sources of equity finance</h2>
<h2 class="h2b">Initial public offering (IPO)</h2>
<p class="noindent">An <a id="gloss-68" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_68"><span class="italic">initial public offering (IPO)</span></a> is the first sale of shares to outside investors by a private company. The company issues shares in order to gain a listing on a stock market. Whereas listed companies have an established share price, private companies have no historic price data. IPOs are therefore riskier (for investors) than (subsequent) public offerings, as it is very difficult to determine the right price for its shares. For example, the 2021 IPO for Deliveroo valued its shares at 390p but the company’s share price fell 30% on the first day when the stock was officially listed on the London Stock Exchange. Some 70,000 private investors lost value as a result.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies)</h2>
<p class="noindent">A significant challenge for private companies seeking to raise finance through an IPO is the need to provide extensive disclosures of the company’s history, including audited financial statements. <a id="page_306"></a>In addition, the risk of stock market volatility has led many companies to postpone their IPOs because of the fear that market volatility could spoil the company’s move into the public sphere.</p>
<p class="noindent">Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) avoid the risk of extreme market volatility, which has been exacerbated in part by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p class="noindent">SPACs are essentially shell companies set up to raise capital, through an IPO, for the purpose of acquiring existing companies. They are typically established by founders who have knowledge and expertise of a particular industry or sector.</p>
<p class="noindent">The founders, who may be institutional investors or high-profile corporate executives, typically already have acquisition target(s) in mind but can avoid extensive disclosures during the IPO process by not identifying the targets. As a result, they can offer a faster IPO process to companies seeking a listing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Investors in a SPAC, who can range from private equity to the general public, may have no idea which companies they will be investing in but are nevertheless attracted because of the track record of success of the founders.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once a SPAC has raised finance, it has two years to acquire a company or return the money to investors.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Additional equity finance</h2>
<p class="noindent">For companies that are <span class="italic">already</span> listed, the most common routes to raising additional equity finance are:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><a id="gloss-106" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_106"><span class="bold">Rights issue</span></a>
<p class="noindent">A rights issue is where shares are issued to <span class="italic">existing</span> shareholders, typically at a discount, in proportion to shareholders’ holding of existing shares. By taking up their rights, shareholders maintain their relative shareholding in the company. Rights issues are typically <span class="italic">underwritten,</span> which means any shares not taken up by the shareholders are purchased by an underwriter (typically an <a id="page_307"></a>investment bank) in return for a fee. The shares may then be sold (‘placed’) to institutional shareholders.</p>
</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="bold">Public offering</span>
<p class="noindent">Listed companies are more likely to raise capital through a <a id="gloss-101" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_101"><span class="italic">public offering</span></a> where their needs are significant and when their share price is high. An issue of shares to <span class="italic">new</span> shareholders typically dilutes <span class="italic">existing</span> shareholders’ interests (see <span class="bold">Optional detail</span> section below).</p>
<p class="noindent">Public offerings are regulated in the UK and have to be supported by a <span class="italic">prospectus</span>, which contains information to help investors make an informed decision about investing. The prospectus must include information about a company’s activities and financial results, its directors and officers, how the money will be used, as well as the risks of investing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">‘Managing’ the share price</h2>
<p class="noindent">A key advantage for listed (compared to non-listed) companies is their ability to access finance through a stock market. However, this creates additional challenges for directors, including the need to manage the share price to meet expectations and deliver against external performance measures (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter27.xhtml">Chapter 27 Investor ratios</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter28.xhtml">Chapter 28 Business valuation</a></span>). Despite being profitable and having loyal customers, directors may take risky decisions, such as pursuing acquisitions to shore up the share price, especially where continued organic growth becomes harder to achieve (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter22.xhtml">Chapter 22 Corporate governance and whistleblowing</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Some listed companies have returned to private (or private equity) ownership, as this takes them out of the spotlight and gives them the ability to take a longer-term view of the business. For example, Michael Dell took Dell computers private in 2013. H. J. Heinz was another company that de-listed in the same year (although it became a public company again in 2015 following its merger with Kraft Foods).</p>
<h2 class="h2"><a id="page_308"></a>Optional detail <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Optional.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Pre-emption rights</h2>
<p class="noindent">A company seeking to raise finance from new shareholders must first disapply <a id="gloss-95" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_95"><span class="italic">pre-emption rights</span></a> of existing shareholders. Pre-emption rights protect existing shareholders against dilution of their percentage shareholding in a company. If shareholders agree to disapply their rights then they accept dilution in exchange for bringing new finance (and shareholders) into the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">The extent of shareholder ‘dilution’ depends on the price and volume of new shares issued.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Example</h2>
<p class="noindent">ABC plc issues 10 million shares at £10 each, a premium of £9 to their original issue price (nominal value of £1).</p>

</table>
<p class="noindent">New finance raised (£100m) is equivalent to the amount raised from original shareholders. However, the level of <span class="italic">dilution</span> is low because shares were issued at a significant premium to nominal value (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15 Capital and reserves</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Alphabet shares</h2>
<p class="noindent">Alphabet shares, as the name might suggest, are ordinary shares denoted by different letters, i.e. A, B, C etc. They provide a means to create subclasses of ordinary shares that carry different rights.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_309"></a>By issuing alphabet shares, a company is able to enhance or restrict shareholders’ voting rights, rights to dividends or rights to capital. For example, A shares may carry twice the voting rights of B shares. Two shareholders each owning the same <span class="italic">number</span> of shares may therefore nevertheless have different rights reflecting the different classes of share held.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Dividends and dividend policy</h2>
<p class="noindent">Only ordinary shares give the holder a right to ownership of the company. Shareholders do not have an automatic right to dividends. Directors will typically disclose their policy towards paying dividends in the annual report. For example, directors may pursue a ‘progressive’ dividend policy in which the dividend is expected to rise at least in line with increases in earnings per share.</p>
<p class="noindent">Companies that have a dividend payment policy are generally viewed positively by investors as dividends create an income stream for investors. There is a view that the share price of companies (that pay dividends) will be higher (than a similar company that does not pay dividends) because it will be more attractive to investors, although this view has been the subject of much debate among academics over many years (see also <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter27.xhtml">Chapter 27 Investor ratios</a></span>).</p>
