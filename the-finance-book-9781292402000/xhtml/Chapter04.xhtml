<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta">The balance sheet is one of the primary financial statements prepared by a company. It shows a company’s financing structure and financial position <span class="italic">at a point in time</span>.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The balance sheet presents a picture of a company’s assets and liabilities, together with the shareholders’ stake in the company. It can be used to assess both liquidity and solvency.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The balance sheet is also known as the statement of financial position.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">The balance sheet is a ‘snapshot’ of the business’s assets and liabilities (net assets) at a point in time, e.g. 31 December. While it is helpful to know this, an investor is interested in understanding the growth in the company’s net assets over time. To identify the <span class="italic">change</span> in assets and liabilities, company directors will take repeated snapshots of the business. In law, a company must typically prepare a balance sheet annually (on the same date) to report to its shareholders how its assets and liabilities have changed over the 12-month period.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_39"></a>The profit and loss account (P&amp;L) (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3 Profit and loss (P&amp;L)</a></span>) helps to explain the growth (or decline) in net assets. When a company makes profits, the net assets of the business grow. When a company makes losses, its net assets are depleted. The P&amp;L is typically reviewed in conjunction with a balance sheet to understand how a business has performed over time. In this context, a helpful analogy is to think of the P&amp;L as a ‘video’ that records the transactions of the business throughout the year. The balance sheet is the ‘photograph’ of the company’s position at the end of the year. By comparing photographs each year and reviewing the video, it is possible to understand how the business has performed.</p>
<p class="noindent">To take the analogy further, a new video is recorded for every year (i.e. the P&amp;L is reset to zero for each new period). The balance sheet photograph in contrast is retaken from one year to the next, so one can see the changes to the business between photographs. </p>
<h2 class="h2a">Assets and liabilities</h2>
<p class="noindent">Simply put, an asset is something that is ‘owned’ and a liability is something that is ‘owed’.</p>
<p class="noindent">The balance sheet is basically a tally of a business’s assets and liabilities. A balance sheet ‘balances’ as the value of its assets will be equal to the value of its liabilities (including shareholders’ equity). It effectively demonstrates the funds required to acquire its assets.</p>

<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_41"></a>Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">The balance sheet is one indication of the size of a business. The balance sheet shows what it owns (its assets), what it owes (its liabilities) and how it is financed (its debt liabilities and shareholders’ equity). For asset-rich businesses, such as manufacturers or property companies, it is an indicative sign of their financial strength.</p>
<p class="noindent">Important measures of a company’s position are calculated from the balance sheet alone, which mostly fall into the following two categories:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>short-term solvency and liquidity, including working capital (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>long-term solvency and stability (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter26.xhtml">Chapter 26 Long-term solvency performance measures</a></span>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The balance sheet can be used as context when analysing a company’s P&amp;L. The following key performance measures (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter23.xhtml">Chapter 23 Profitability performance measures</a></span>) are calculated from both financial statements:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>asset turnover</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>return on capital employed</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>return on equity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">As a balance sheet represents a set point in time in a company’s life, it is important to consider <span class="italic">timing</span> when interpreting balance sheets. A snapshot taken a day earlier or later could potentially present a different picture of a business.</p>
<p class="noindent">The timing differences between when income is earned and received and expenditure is incurred and paid (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1 Business accounting</a></span>) can be found in the balance sheet. The key timing differences to pay attention to are:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>stock (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11 Stock</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>debtors and creditors (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12 Debtors and creditors</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><a id="page_42"></a><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>prepayments and accruals (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter13.xhtml">Chapter 13 Prepayments and accruals</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>deferred income and accrued income (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter13.xhtml">Chapter 13 Prepayments and accruals</a></span>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Auditors (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20 External financial audit</a></span>) will always be attentive to transactions around the year end. They will consider how they impact on balance sheet values and to make sure they are reflected in the correct period. Auditors may also focus on revaluations (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter17.xhtml">Chapter 17 Revaluation</a></span>) and impairments (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter18.xhtml">Chapter 18 Impairment</a></span>) and their impact on balance sheet asset values.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Other items in the balance sheet</h2>
<p class="noindent">Other balance sheet items worth noting are listed below:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Goodwill: the difference between the purchase price from an acquisition and the value of the acquired assets (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10 Goodwill and other intangibles</a></span>).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Provisions: money set aside for a known liability whose extent and timing cannot be precisely determined (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter14.xhtml">Chapter 14 Provisions and contingencies</a></span>).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Deferred tax: timing differences between accounting and tax regulations (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8 Business tax</a></span>).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Capital reserves: surpluses which have not arisen from trading (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15 Capital and reserves</a></span>).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Revenue reserves: trading profit retained in the business for future investment (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15 Capital and reserves</a></span>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">Balance sheet valuation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Asset values within a balance sheet are typically stated at historic cost (known by accountants as ‘book value’). Under certain <a id="page_43"></a>accounting regulations, such as UK GAAP, assets can be revalued (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter17.xhtml">Chapter 17 Revaluation</a></span>). For example, investments or property (which is one of the largest asset values in the balance sheet) are often revalued.</p>
<p class="noindent">The question if asset values should be adjusted to reflect current market values is an ongoing contentious issue, especially in periods of high inflation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes a balance sheet can contain a mixture of historic and current values. This is influenced by the accounting policies chosen by a company (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Liabilities are typically stated at the amount ‘owed’ to third parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is important to be aware of the impact of fluctuating asset and liability values on the overall balance sheet value and its related performance measures.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is also important to note that the balance sheet is unlikely to reflect the market values of all its individual assets or the total company (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter28.xhtml">Chapter 28 Business valuation</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2">Optional detail <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Optional.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Different perspectives on the balance sheet</h2>
<p class="noindent">All balance sheets show the assets and liabilities of a business. Some balance sheets simply show all a company’s assets in one section, and all a company’s liabilities and shareholders’ equity in another. The two sections will always be equal. Total assets will always equal total liabilities plus shareholders’ equity.</p>
<p class="mathi"><math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="">
 <mrow>
  <mtext>Assets = Liabilities and shareholders</mtext><mo>'</mo><mtext>equity</mtext></mrow>
</math></p>
<p class="noindent">However, it is possible to arrange the two sections or halves in different ways. For example, it can be useful to show some of the liabilities with some of the assets. Whichever way the balance sheet is arranged, the two halves will remain equal (i.e. balance). <a id="page_44"></a>Accounting regulations will determine the presentation used (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Two examples of alternative presentations are below:</p>
<h2 class="h2b">1 Net assets/Shareholders’ funds</h2>
<p class="noindent">Shareholders are the primary user of financial statements and this balance sheet presentation is designed to present the business from their perspective.</p>
<p class="noindent">Shareholders’ funds (equity) are shown on the right of the diagram, balanced by <span class="italic">net assets</span> (fixed assets + current assets − current liabilities − debt) on the left-hand side.</p>

<p class="noindent">A common performance measure is ROE (return on equity) or RONA (return on <span class="italic">net assets</span>) (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter23.xhtml">Chapter 23 Profitability performance measures</a></span>), which utilises this presentation of the balance sheet. The total of each half of the balance sheet represents the ‘value’ of the shareholders’ investment in the business.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">2 Source and utilisation of finance </h2>
<p class="noindent">A balance sheet can alternatively be seen as a picture of a how a company has sourced its finance (funds) and how it has utilised the finance raised.</p>
<p class="noindent">The company’s sources of finance (equity and debt) (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter29.xhtml">Chapter 29 Equity finance</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter30.xhtml">Chapter 30 Debt finance</a></span>) are shown on the <a id="page_45"></a>right of the diagram, balanced by its utilisation of finance or ‘capital employed’ in the business (fixed assets + current assets - current liabilities) on the left-hand side.</p>

<p class="noindent">A common performance measure is ROCE (return on capital employed), which utilises this presentation of the balance sheet (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter23.xhtml">Chapter 23 Profitability performance measures</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">This form of presentation shows the business from the perspective of the providers of business finance, both equity and debt.
