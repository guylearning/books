<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta">The CFS (cash flow statement) is one of the primary financial statements within a set of accounts.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The CFS shows the inflows and outflows of cash during a reporting period. It explains how the cash balance shown in the balance sheet has increased or decreased from the previous reporting period.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The CFS contains three major headings, under which inflows and outflows of cash are categorised:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<ul class="box2">
<li class="box2"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Operating activities</li>
<li class="box2"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Investing activities</li>
<li class="box2"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Financing activities.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="noindenta">For a business, ‘cash is king’ and analysing the CFS is a highly informative way to assess a company’s ability to generate and utilise its cash.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">The CFS is one of the most useful financial statements to analyse a company’s performance and its cash management. It provides a number of insights not available from the more familiar P&amp;L (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3 Profit and loss (P&amp;L</a></span>)) and balance sheet (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4 Balance sheet</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_50"></a>Cash is a matter of fact. The P&amp;L and balance sheet incorporate accounting adjustments which are subject to judgement such as accruals (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter13.xhtml">Chapter 13 Prepayments and accruals</a></span>), provisions (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter14.xhtml">Chapter 14 Provisions and contingencies</a></span>) and depreciation (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation</a></span>). There is no judgement in a CFS.</p>
<p class="noindent">The CFS reveals how a company has:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>managed its short-term liquidity, such as managing stock (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11 Stock</a></span>) and balancing debtors and creditors (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>controlled its long-term solvency and adapted its financing to prepare for its future (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter26.xhtml">Chapter 26 Long-term solvency performance measures</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>invested in assets for its future.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">For an established business, the CFS can be used to give an indication of the amount, timing and certainty of future cash flows. It also enables comparability of a company’s year-to-year cash position, as cash flows are not affected by accounting policies.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are three parts of a cash flow statement. These are illustrated in the diagram below and explained in the following paragraphs.</p>

<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_51"></a>Operating activities</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a id="gloss-88" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_88"><span class="italic">Operating activities</span></a> are the principal revenue-generating activities of the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the CFS, they also include interest and tax payments.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is the key section of the CFS as it shows whether the business is generating a positive cash flow from its operations. A company that is not generating cash has to borrow or deplete short-term cash reserves. Ultimately, cash from operations must support the rest of the business in the long run.</p>
<p class="noindent">The main operating activities are:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>cash received from customers</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>cash paid to suppliers</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>cash paid to and on behalf of employees</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>interest and taxes paid.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The difference between the cash from operating activities and the operating profit are mainly due to:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>accounting adjustments</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>movements in working capital</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>interest and taxes paid.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">This difference is reconciled in the supporting notes to the CFS. </p>
<p class="noindent">See the <span class="bold">In practice</span> section for further discussion and the <span class="bold">Nice to know</span> section for more detail on the reconciliation.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Investing activities</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a id="gloss-72" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_72"><span class="italic">Investing activities</span></a> are typically the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments.</p>
<p class="noindent">They also include returns from investments such as bank deposits and dividends from other companies in which the business holds shares.</p>
<p class="noindent">Investing activities are important to the long-term success of a business and demonstrate the extent of new investment in assets. <a id="page_52"></a>These investments will hopefully support future cash flows and generate profit.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Financing activities</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a id="gloss-49" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_49"><span class="italic">Financing activities</span></a> are changes (increases or decreases) to funding from either <a id="gloss-43" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_43"><span class="italic">equity finance</span></a> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter29.xhtml">Chapter 29 Equity finance</a></span>) or <a id="gloss-32" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_32"><span class="italic">debt finance</span></a> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter30.xhtml">Chapter 30 Debt finance</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">They include dividends paid to shareholders. Although, interest paid to debtholders, such as banks, is shown under operating activities.</p>
<p class="noindent">Financing activities indicate how well a company is managing its financing by balancing its <a id="gloss-56" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_56"><span class="italic">gearing</span></a> (the amount of debt versus equity – see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter26.xhtml">Chapter 26 Long-term solvency performance measures</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">They also provide an indication of future interest and dividend payments.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice – cash versus profit <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Cash is not the same as profit (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1 Business accounting</a></span>) and in practice this is clearly demonstrated in the CFS.</p>
<p class="noindent">The year-on-year change in a company’s operating profits may not correlate to its change in cash generated from operating activities.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, Royal Dutch Shell reported a $21.7m loss during 2020 after the coronavirus pandemic caused demand to slump. However, the company still generated £34.1m of operating cash flows as the loss was created largely by accounting adjustments (a write-down in the future value of the company's oil fields and prospects).</p>
<p class="noindent">In the long run, the cash flow from operating activities and operating results should move in the same direction. However, it’s the short-term differences which may reveal insights into performance which can’t be identified from the other financial statements.</p>
<h2 class="h2"><a id="page_53"></a>Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Calculating cash flows from operating activities</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are two permitted methods under IAS 7 (statement of cash flows) to calculate cash flows from operating activities:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>the direct method and</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>the indirect method.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Whichever method is used; it is shown either following or as a supporting note to the CFS.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Direct method</h2>
<p class="noindent">This method provides the most clarity over where cash flows have been derived and spent.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">Free cash flow (FCF)</h2>
<p class="noindent">FCF has grown in prevalence as an alternative performance measure. In essence it is calculated by deducting capital expenditure from operating cash flow.</p>
<p class="noindent">FCF is effectively the cash remaining after internal obligations. It shows the cash available to fund potential strategic investments, repay debt or distribute returns to shareholders. It is both a measure of security and opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent">FCF is a popular measure as, being cash based, it is less subject to accounting adjustments. However, as it is not defined in accounting standards (see<span class="bold"> <a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>) it is calculated in different ways by different companies and analysts, making it challenging to compare across companies.</p>
<p class="noindent">As FCF includes potentially lumpy capital expenditure it should be viewed over a number of years.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Cash and cash equivalents</h2>
<p class="noindent">The CFS analyses the change in ‘cash and cash equivalents’ from one reporting period to another.</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>‘Cash’ means physical cash held in the company (e.g. petty cash) plus cash held in instant access bank accounts.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>‘Cash equivalents’ are short-term (3 months or less to maturity), highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to cash and do not significantly fluctuate in value (e.g. commercial paper and marketable securities). These are held to meet short-term cash commitments and not for investment purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The CFS does not differentiate between ‘cash’ and different types of ‘cash equivalents’.</p>
