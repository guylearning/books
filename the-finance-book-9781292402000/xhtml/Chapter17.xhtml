<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindentai">The balance sheet typically records fixed assets at their purchase (historic) cost. A business is permitted, under accounting rules, to record fixed assets at their <span class="italic">market</span> value. The business can further choose which types (classes) of fixed asset to revalue (e.g. land and buildings, plant and machinery). However, once a company decides to revalue one or more classes of assets, valuations must be kept up to date.</p>
<p class="noindentai">The effect of revaluing is to increase (or decrease) fixed asset values from their original purchase cost. The higher (or lower) value is recorded within fixed assets and included as a gain (or loss) is recorded in a <span class="italic">revaluation reserve.</span></p>
<p class="noindentai">Land and buildings is the class of fixed assts most likely to be revalued.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">A company has the option to choose whether it wants to revalue its fixed assets and which class(es) of assets to revalue. It is an accounting policy <span class="italic">choice</span> (see Chapter <span class="bold">19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a business decides to revalue however it must do so regularly, so that the carrying amount of an asset does not differ materially from its fair value at the balance sheet date. Valuations should be carried out by independent experts such as qualified surveyors.</p>
<p class="noindent">Revalued assets are subject to depreciation in the same way as fixed assets held at historic cost (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation</a></span>).<a id="page_166"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2a">Example 1– Revaluation of building (assume no depreciation)</h2>
<p class="noindent">ABC Ltd originally purchased a building at a cost of £100,000. The company has adopted a policy to revalue buildings. At the end of the year, the building had a market value of £250,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ‘gain’ in value is calculated as the difference between valuation and original cost, i.e. £150,000 (£250,000 − £100,000).</p>
<p class="noindent">This would be reflected in the financial statements as follows:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col class="colwidth50"/>
<col class="colwidth50"/>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Fixed assets (building)</td>
<td class="tdleft">£250,000 (£100,000 + £150,000)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Revaluation reserve</td>
<td class="tdleft">£150,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="noindent">Note that the revaluation <span class="italic">gain</span> of £150,000 is recorded within a revaluation reserve, not in the profit and loss account. The revaluation reserve is a capital reserve and is therefore not distributable (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15 Capital and reserves</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Why and when is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/> <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Companies may choose a policy of revaluation to improve their balance sheet net asset position. Asset values, particularly land and buildings, generally rise over time and this can present commercial benefits for the business:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>A business that is considering acquisition talks with another company would show a stronger balance sheet net asset position after revaluation. This may strengthen its negotiating position.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Revaluations demonstrate the value of security available against which to borrow. What would otherwise be ‘hidden’ value is visible on the balance sheet, providing visible evidence of additional asset security available.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>For companies already laden with debt, revaluing assets may create headroom to meet existing covenant terms or secure further loans (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter30.xhtml">Chapter 30 Debt finance</a></span>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_167"></a>Companies may be inclined or feel obliged to adopt a revaluation policy where this is the norm across an industry, as it makes performance comparisons easier. However, revaluation is a policy <span class="italic">choice</span> and this choice can make comparing businesses more difficult. Financial statements are however required to include sufficient information to enable comparison of performance (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>). Specifically, companies that adopt a policy of revaluation must disclose equivalent historical cost information in their financial statements. This enables comparison on a like-for-like basis between companies that revalue and those that adopt a historic cost basis of accounting.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Gains versus profits</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Gains</span> are different to <span class="italic">profits</span>. <span class="italic">Profits</span> arise from <span class="italic">trading or operating</span> activities. Revaluations are <span class="italic">gains</span> that arise as a result of accounting measurement changes rather than trading activities. Increases (or decreases) in the value of fixed assets held are therefore recorded in a revaluation reserve, which is a capital i.e. non-distributable reserve (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15 Capital and reserves</a></span>)<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To understand clearly the distinction between <span class="italic">gain</span> and <span class="italic">profit,</span> consider the property you live in. If the property has increased in value over the period since it was purchased, then this is a <span class="italic">capital gain</span> for the owner<span class="italic">.</span> However, this gain cannot be considered a <span class="italic">profit</span> as it is an <span class="italic">unrealised</span> gain or ‘paper’ gain. Unless or until the property is sold, the benefit (in the form of cash proceeds) cannot be accessed by the property owner (although the property owner could utilise the increase in value as security against further borrowings). (Unrealised) <span class="italic">gains</span> convert into <span class="italic">profit</span> only when a fixed asset is sold. At this point the gain becomes <span class="italic">realised</span>. In the case of the property owner, they are able to convert the (paper) gain into cash following sale. In the case of a business, when a revalued asset is sold, a profit is realised on sale and the surplus is available for distribution, i.e. can be paid out as dividends (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15 Capital and reserves</a></span>).<a id="page_168"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2a">Downward revaluation (assume no depreciation)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Asset values can of course go down as well as up. Decreases in valuation will reverse any previous (upward) revaluations.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Example 2a</h2>
<p class="noindent">Using information from Example 1:</p>
<p class="noindent">Three years later, a revaluation of the property results in a fall in value to £200,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The asset’s value has fallen by £50,000 since the previous valuation, i.e. from £250,000 to £200,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The latest valuation would be reflected as follows:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col class="colwidth50"/>
<col class="colwidth50"/>
<col class="colwidth50"/>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Fixed assets (building)</td>
<td class="tdleft">£200,000</td>
<td class="tdleft">(£50,000 lower than the previous valuation)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Revaluation reserve</td>
<td class="tdleft">£100,000</td>
<td class="tdleft">(£150,000 − £50,000)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="noindent">Note that, despite the lower valuation, the asset is still valued <span class="italic">above</span> its original cost, i.e. there is still an (unrealised) gain of £100,000 relating to the asset (shown in the revaluation reserve).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Example 2b – losses</h2>
<p class="noindent">If a revaluation takes the valuation <span class="italic">below</span> the original purchase cost, the difference is a loss and must be ‘expensed’, i.e. charged as an expense in the profit and loss account.</p>
<p class="noindent">Continuing Example 2a, a few years later the asset is revalued (downwards) to £60,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The latest valuation of £60,000 is now below the original cost (£100,000).</p>

<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Accounting loss</td>
<td class="tdleft">£40,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_169"></a>The asset has fallen in value by £140,000 since the previous valuation. The asset value is reduced by £140,000 to a new value of £60,000. The revaluation reserve is eliminated (£100,000 − £100,000) and the remaining difference of £40,000 (£140,000 − £100,000) is charged against the company’s profits in the year. The loss must be recognised even though the asset has not been sold to reflect ‘prudent’ accounting (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6 Revenue recognition</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Despite the potential benefits, relatively few companies choose to adopt a policy of revaluation. A company is likely to prefer historic cost accounting because a policy of revaluation can result in considerable cost to implement (e.g. professional fees of independent valuers) and require significant management effort to keep asset values up to date.</p>
<p class="noindent">Revaluations also adversely impact key profitability ratios (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter23.xhtml">Chapter 23 Profitability performance measures</a></span>) such as return on capital employed (ROCE) because upward revaluations result in higher asset values.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Example 3 (assume no depreciation)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Using the same information from Example 1 and assuming the company’s profit were £10,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">ROCE would be calculated as follows:</p>

<p class="noindent">Higher asset values also result in increased depreciation charges, reducing profit (see <span class="bold">Example 4</span> in the <span class="bold">Optional detail</span> section below) and ROCE.</p>
<h2 class="h2"><a id="page_170"></a>Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Subjectivity and manipulation</h2>
<p class="noindent">A business choosing a policy of revaluation does not have to revalue <span class="italic">all</span> of its fixed assets under that policy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Revaluations must be undertaken by ‘class of asset’ although the definition of ‘class’ may be open to interpretation. ‘Land and buildings’ are typically considered to be one class of asset, ‘plant and machinery’ another etc. A company could, however, argue that ‘office buildings’ and ‘manufacturing buildings’ represent different classes of asset, even though they are both examples of land and buildings.</p>
<p class="noindent">Such subjectivity might enable a business to ‘cherry pick’ classes of assets most likely to benefit from rising values.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Valuation methods</h2>
<p class="noindent">Market values must be used wherever possible when carrying out revaluations. However, for certain assets, such as specialised machinery, a ‘market’ to determine value may not exist. Where no market exists, <span class="italic">depreciated replacement cost</span> is used as an alternative. Essentially this method attempts to estimate the current cost of replacing an identical asset, i.e. the current cost of an asset adjusted for its present age and condition.</p>

<p class="noindent">Revalued assets must be depreciated, applying the same methods as would be applied to historic cost fixed assets.</p>

<p class="noindent">Depreciation is higher in company B as it has revalued its assets. A higher annual depreciation charge will have the effect of reducing profit (and therefore distributable earnings) in company B.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reported profits are lower in company B and this will further impact ROCE negatively (see earlier). However, one advantage of the reduction in profits caused by a higher depreciation charge is that it restricts the amount that can be paid out as dividends. This means a company retains more funds within the business for asset <a id="page_172"></a>replacement. In contrast, depreciation based on historic cost may enable a company to pay higher (excessive) dividends leaving it with insufficient cash reserves to fund the purchase of a replacement asset at a higher price in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent">Company directors adopting a policy of revaluation may need to maintain dividend payouts because of shareholder expectations to deliver a constant or <span class="italic">progressive</span> dividend policy (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter27.xhtml">Chapter 27 Investor ratios</a></span>). Accounting rules permit an <span class="italic">adjustment</span> to reserves for companies that choose to revalue their assets so that the effects on profits of higher depreciation can be reversed. A transfer equal to the <span class="italic">excess</span> depreciation is permitted, <span class="italic">from</span> the revaluation reserve <span class="italic">to</span> distributable profits. In the above example, £4,000 per year may be transferred <span class="italic">from</span> the revaluation reserve <span class="italic">to</span> distributable reserves by company B. The effect of this adjustment is that company B would not be at any disadvantage to company A in the amount it is legally able to pay as dividends.</p>
