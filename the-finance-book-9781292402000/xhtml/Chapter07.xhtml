<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_70"></a>Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Both annual profit and the ‘size’ of the balance sheet are important performance measures for both businesses and managers (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter23.xhtml">Chapter 23 Profitability performance measures</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter26.xhtml">Chapter 26 Long-term solvency performance measures</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision to categorise an item of expenditure as either opex or capex will impact the profit and loss account and/or the balance sheet in different ways.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">‘Grey areas’</h2>
<p class="noindent">The opex versus capex distinction becomes relevant for items of expenditure which could potentially fall into either opex or capex.</p>
<p class="noindent">A typical grey area is repairs and refurbishments. General repairs and maintenance are usually opex. Refurbishments are usually capex. There could, however, be repairs or refurbishments which can fall into either category. For example, repairing a broken window could clearly be categorised as opex under ‘repairs and maintenance’. However, if the new window is an improvement on the old window, such as being polarised, then it could be argued that it should be categorised as capex.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Businesses may be tempted to take advantage of the grey areas and categorise expenditure as capex instead of opex and vice versa when:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>rewards are based on profit targets – recognising an expense as capex as opposed to opex will have a favourable impact on the current year’s profits. Similarly, once a profit target has been exceeded, recognising an expense as opex as opposed to capex will reduce the depreciation expense in future years (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation</a></span>) </li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>there are separate organisational budgets for opex and capex and one of the budgets has been fully spent</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>financing is available for expenditure on ‘investments’ (capex) and not ‘running costs’ (opex).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_71"></a>In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Most companies should have a clear and consistent policy. The same items of expenditure should be treated the same way over time.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, due to the discretion enabled by the grey areas, different companies could have different policies and show different profits and asset values from the same transaction.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">In practice, companies should use clear and persuasive reasoning to make distinctions between opex and capex classifications. Their decisions should not be motivated by a desire to present target profit and asset values.</p>
<p class="noindent">To be classified as capex, expenditure should improve a long-term asset and increase its value, rather than merely maintaining the economic benefits expected from the asset. </p>
<h2 class="h2a">Accounting standards</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of accounting and financial reporting standards (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>) which cover some common grey areas between opex and capex classification. For example:</p>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span>Expenditure on development costs is allowed to be capitalised (treated as capex) if a company can demonstrate future benefits from the development.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span>Certain costs of ‘borrowing’ to purchase a fixed asset can be capitalised.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">To reduce the administration burden, most companies will have a predetermined capex limit. For example, any expense under £1,000, whether a capital item or not, will be ‘expensed’, i.e. treated as opex. Capex requires further record keeping (within a fixed asset register) and depreciation calculations (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation</a></span>).<a id="page_72"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2">Optional detail <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Optional.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">In financial statements there is a degree of discretion over opex and capex classification. However, under tax law the distinction between opex and capex is tightly defined. Therefore, the treatment of opex and capex can often be different in the ‘tax accounts’ (essentially a separate profit calculation upon which the tax charge is based) to the financial accounts (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8 Business tax</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2">Reflect and embed your understanding <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Reflect.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="36"/></h2>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span>The directors of a business are looking to boost the profits reported in the current accounting period. Reflect on your knowledge and understanding of capex and opex and the extent to which this area of accounting might be used by directors to achieve their objectives?</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span>Can you list some examples of grey areas when distinguishing between opex and capex?</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">3</span><span class="pad1"></span>What kinds of business decisions could be affected by the classification of opex or capex?</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">4</span><span class="pad1"></span>Review the capex policy of an example organisation. Is it clear and unambiguous? If there is a capex limit, is it set at a reasonable level?</li>

<p class="noindent">Extracts from the financial review relating to capex follows:</p>
<div class="box2">
<p class="box-exth">Capital expenditure</p>
<p class="noindentai">We invested a total of £58.7 million (2019: £86.0 million) in capital expenditure during 2020. The year started with an ambitious programme of investment activity designed to grow our shop numbers and create supply chain capacity for future expansion. In quarter two, in order to protect liquidity, we stopped almost all capital expenditure with the exception of the work on our new, automated cold store at Balliol Park in Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>
<p class="noindentai">As our shops reopened in the middle of 2020 and we became more confident of sustainable trading levels we selectively recommenced capital works. Capital expenditure to support new shop openings was focused on pipeline opportunities in locations which customers typically access by car, these having proved the most resilient under prevailing trading conditions.</p>
<p class="noindentai">Depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment and intangibles in the year was £60.8 million (2019: £59.9 million). A further £51.9 million (2019: £50.8 million) of depreciation was charged in respect of right-of use assets as a result of capitalised leases.</p>
<p class="noindentai">Our plans for 2021 include capital expenditure of around £70 million. This will include completion of the Balliol Park automated cold store, increases to manufacturing capacity for savoury products and a return to the previous rate of expansion of our shop estate. In this respect we will be investing in around 100 new company-managed shops alongside further openings with franchise partners.<a id="page_74"></a></p>
<p class="noindentai">Having invested substantially in the shop estate in recent years we intend to refurbish relatively few shops in 2021 but will continue trials of formats designed to support future plans. The requirement for capital expenditure to refurbish our existing shops will increase in the coming years and we will start to address supply chain capacity to meet the growth opportunities ahead. On current plans we expect this to require capital expenditure of c.£90 million in 2022 followed by c.£100 million in 2023.</p>
