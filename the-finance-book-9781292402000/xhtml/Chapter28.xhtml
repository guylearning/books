<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta">For a business, the ultimate measure of success is its valuation, which is essentially the price a willing buyer is prepared to pay to own part or all of the business.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Public companies have a real-time indication of their valuation though the stock market, which provides a platform for buyers and sellers to interact. Private businesses, however, have less access to buyers and sellers and therefore valuations are more challenging.</p>
<p class="noindenta">There are a number of valuation methodologies, which provide a range of prices and are used by both buyers and sellers to start negotiations. In practice valuing a business is an art, not a science, and is affected by a wide range of factors.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Listed company directors are typically focused on maximising business value, reflected in the share price, while responding to dividend expectations of investors (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter29.xhtml">Chapter 29 Equity finance</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">For a private entity, the sale or flotation of the business is an exit route for investors and building long-term value may be one of its <a id="page_286"></a>main objectives. Even for companies which have no apparent intention of selling or floating, for example IKEA, building long-term value will correlate to long-term survival.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">For a listed company its share price will be a continual focus for its directors and will also influence its performance measures (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter29.xhtml">Chapter 29 Equity finance</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter27.xhtml">Chapter 27 Investor ratios</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">For a private business, valuations are typically required when:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>the owner wishes to sell or exit via a flotation</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>a purchaser wishes to buy the business</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>new shareholders are introduced, usually to raise further equity finance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">Techniques</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are two main methods of valuing a business: asset based and income based. There are two main techniques of calculating income-based valuations: multiples and discounted cash flows.</p>

<h2 class="h2b">1 Asset based</h2>
<p class="noindent">Assets are the common-sense starting point for most valuations as they give the minimum valuation that a business should be willing to accept. Asset-based valuations are most useful for asset-rich <a id="page_287"></a>businesses, such as property holding and some manufacturing companies.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, an asset-based valuation is not as simple as taking a number from the latest balance sheet (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4 Balance sheet</a></span>). The valuer will need to conduct an ‘review’ (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20 External financial audit</a></span>) of the business to identify all its assets and liabilities and value them correctly. See the <span class="bold">Nice to know</span> section for further detail.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">2 Income based</h2>
<p class="noindent">Income-based valuations typically produce a higher value than asset-based valuations and give an indication of the maximum price an acquirer would wish to pay. If the company has a profitable trading history and is likely to continue as a going concern (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25 Insolvency and going concern risk</a></span>), an income-based valuation is usually preferable.</p>
<ul class="alphan">
<li class="alphan"><span class="ash1">a</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">Multiples</span>. A simple approach to income-based valuations applies a multiplier to either revenue or ideally profit.
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Revenue multiples can be used for start-ups which may not yet be profitable or for businesses with volatile profits.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Profit multiples are better than revenue multiples, as they account for costs as well as revenue. There is a high correlation between profit and value across an industry sector.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentl">In either case the revenue or profit figure used should be sustainable and not contain exceptional(one-off) items (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3 Profit and loss (P&amp;L</a></span>)). This is often referred to as ‘future maintainable earnings’.</p>
<p class="noindentl">Multiples will vary between industries and economic cycles. For profit multiples, the quoted P/E ratio (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter27.xhtml">Chapter 27 Investor ratios</a></span>) for the industry is a good starting point. For a private entity the P/E ratio quoted for its industry is typically discounted to reflect the fact that the business will be less marketable than a typically larger public listed company.</p>
<p class="noindentl">BDO UK LLP publishes the quarterly PCPI (Private Company Price Index) which analyses the multiples typically used in <a id="page_288"></a>valuing private companies. Historically, the larger the business, the larger the multiple.</p>
</li>
<li class="alphan"><span class="ash1">b</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">Discounted cash flows</span>. Arguably the most sophisticated income-based valuation involves calculating the present value of future cash flows.
<p class="noindentl">This involves forecasting future cash flows based on various assumptions such as growth rate, margins, financing costs, tax rates and capital expenditure.</p>
<p class="noindentl">Many companies use the concept of ‘free cash flows’, being operating cash flows less capital expenditure (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5 Cash flow statement</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindentl">The future free cash flows are discounted back to present value using an appropriate cost of capital (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter35.xhtml">Chapter 35 Investment appraisal</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindentl">Estimating future cash flows, growth rates and the cost of capital is challenging. A small change in the assumptions can make a big difference to the valuation. In addition, past performance is not always a reliable predictor of future performance.</p>
<p class="noindentl">For an income-based valuation, due diligence (a comprehensive appraisal of the target business) will include an examination of income and expenditure (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3 Profit and loss (P&amp;L)</a></span>), the target’s cost structure (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter33.xhtml">Chapter 33 Profit planning</a></span>) and the reliability of estimates and forecast assumptions. Due diligence may also include an examination of accounting polices (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">For a publicly listed company, maintaining a steady growth in share price is challenging, due to extrinsic factors largely beyond the control of directors, such as:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>competitors’ actions or reactions</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>analysts’ opinions</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>media stories and rumours</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><a id="page_289"></a>speculative behaviour</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>market sentiment and the economy</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>stock market bubbles and crashes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">For a private business, valuation is more of an art than a science because value is a matter of opinion and ultimately negotiation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Therefore, the best approach to valuation is to:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Use a variety of valuation techniques to see if they are relatively close.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Research the valuation of similar businesses which have recently been sold.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Research the ‘offer price’ of similar businesses currently for sale.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of the various valuation techniques is to provide a range of values (rather than a precise figure) as the basis for negotiations between a buyer and seller. Like most successful negotiations, the skill in valuation is to find the common ground.</p>
<p class="noindent">The final valuation will depend upon:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Percentage of equity being valued (acquirers will pay a premium for the ability to influence/control strategic decisions).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Strategic reasons for buying or selling and the willingness of the owners to sell.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Quality, experience and credibility of management and employees, including organisational culture.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Commercial potential of the target’s products and services.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Competitiveness of the target’s marketplace.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Number of competing buyers and sellers and their negotiation skills.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>If the transaction will be settled in cash (usually the most attractive form of consideration for target company shareholders) or in shares (target company shareholders receive consideration in the form of shares in the acquiring company).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Macroeconomic and geopolitical factors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2"><a id="page_290"></a>Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Valuation premiums</h2>
<p class="noindent">In order to acquire another business, some businesses pay significant premiums above the values obtained by traditional valuation methods.</p>
<p class="noindent">The technology sector has provided some interesting examples of premiums:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>In February 2020, Netherlands-based <a href="http://Takeaway.com">Takeaway.com</a> acquired Just Eat for $7.8 billion. In March 2021, the combined group, Just Eat <a href="http://Takeaway.com">Takeaway.com</a>, acquired US-based Grubhub for $7.3bn to create the world’s largest food delivery company outside China. The valuations reflect the desire to consolidate within this fast-growing market and the tough competition from rivals such as Uber Eats and Amazon backed Deliveroo.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>In February 2014, Facebook Inc acquired WhatsApp Inc for USD $19.3 billion. At the time WhatsApp had circa USD $50 million turnover and employed just over 50 people. Facebook was clearly motivated by more than traditional financials. Potential user growth, user engagement, competitive and strategic factors played far more of a role in its valuation.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>In November 2006, Google acquired YouTube for USD $1.65 billion which bore little relation to YouTube’s financials at the time. Google saw the future potential of YouTube which at the time was one of the fastest-growing websites on the internet and is now (at the time of publication) one of most popular websites in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">See also <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10 Goodwill and other intangibles</a></span> for an example of the premium paid by AOL for Time Warner in 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent">In deciding upon a valuation premium, acquirers will account for potential synergistic benefits. Examples of synergies are:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Marketing – opportunities to cross-sell and build a bigger brand.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Operations – <a id="page_291"></a>economies of scale, purchasing power and elimination of duplicate costs.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Financial – access to cheaper finance (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter30.xhtml">Chapter 30 Debt finance</a></span>), lower cost of capital (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter35.xhtml">Chapter 35 Investment appraisal</a></span>) and tax benefits (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8 Business tax</a></span>).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Assets – access to unique resources, such as patents.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Management – access to individuals, their reputation, experience and shared learnings.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Risk-spreading – diversification into new markets and products/services.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Competitive – to stop a rival obtaining the target.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">However, the premium paid often far outweighs the synergistic benefits of an acquisition. Research by KPMG has shown that 70–80% of mergers and acquisitions fail to create shareholder value.<sup><a href="Chapter28.xhtml#fn1" id="rfn1">1</a></sup> Some argue that excessive premiums are paid for acquisitions to meet investors’ expectations of growth momentum, which cannot be achieved by organic growth alone.</p>
<p class="noindent">As Warren Buffett once said, ‘It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.’</p>
<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_292"></a>Asset-based valuations</h2>
<p class="noindent">Assets and liabilities should be revalued to reflect their current worth. Additional assets and liabilities may also be identified as part of any valuation process.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">Market to book ratio</h2>
<p class="noindent">The <a id="gloss-78" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_78"><span class="italic">market to book ratio</span></a> is a useful performance measure which focuses on business valuation.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="mathi"><math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="">
 <mrow>
  <mfrac>
   <mrow>
    <mtext>Business Value</mtext></mrow>
   <mrow>
    <mtext>Net Asset Value (NAV)</mtext></mrow>
  </mfrac>
  </mrow>
</math></p>
<p class="noindent">The ratio represents the market (or acquirers) perception of the overall business – its profits, balance sheet strength, management and future prospects. For a listed business with a quoted share price this ratio is readily available. For a non-listed business, the value will be more challenging to determine as discussed within this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ratio compares shareholders’ investment in a company with the value of the company.</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>A successful business should have a value greater than one, and ideally two or more.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>A value of less than one means that future profits are likely to be insufficient for shareholders to realise fully their current investment in the company.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">However, businesses invested in long-term projects, for example property companies, are typically valued at less than their NAV. One reason for this is the low liquidity of assets (i.e. property) owned by these companies, which results in market uncertainty about whether the net asset value can be realised.</p>
<p class="noindent">Additionally, this performance measure naturally assumes that the company’s market valuation is accurate, which is not guaranteed to be the case. A value of less than one could potentially mean the business is undervalued relative to its NAV.</p>
<p class="noindent">See also <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter23.xhtml">Chapter 23 Profitability performance measures</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter27.xhtml">Chapter 27 Investor ratios</a></span>.</p>
