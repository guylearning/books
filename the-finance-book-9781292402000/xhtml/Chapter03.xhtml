<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta">The P&amp;L (‘profit and loss account’) or ‘income statement’ is one of the primary financial statements prepared by a company. It shows a company’s financial performance over time.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The purpose of a P&amp;L is to show the profit (or loss) made by an organisation over time, typically a year. The P&amp;L shows the income earned and expenditure incurred to generate either profit or loss.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">The P&amp;L records the financial activities of a business <span class="italic">over a period of time</span>, which could be a day, a week, a month, a quarter or a year. It can be useful to think of the P&amp;L as a video recording of the business’s journey from one balance sheet (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4 Balance sheet</a></span>) date to another. In each period the recording starts from scratch (or zero).</p>
<p class="noindent">A funnel analogy can be used to represent the P&amp;L. Revenue (sales) enters a business at the top of the funnel and is then reduced by various costs and expenses. The remaining output of the funnel, if any, represents the profit retained in the business.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_30"></a>The following diagram explains the inflows and outflows as in more detail.</p>

<p class="alt-noindent">The 6 stages of the funnel represent various costs and expenses. The dots between the stages represent various profits. Revenue (sales) enters at the top of the funnel. The first stage is the cost of sales followed by gross profit. The second stage is operating expenses followed by operating profit. The third stage is non-operating income or expenses followed by profit before interest and tax. The fourth stage is interest followed by profit before tax. The fifth stage is tax followed by profit after tax and the sixth stage is dividends. The output of the funnel is retained profit.</p>

<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_32"></a>Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Profit is the primary measure of business performance, success and long-term survival. Simplified P&amp;Ls can also be prepared for individual divisions, departments, products, customers, etc. P&amp;Ls should be commonplace throughout an organisation.</p>
<p class="noindent">For managers, it may be the most important source of their financial information and a key financial performance measure.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Although company accounts containing P&amp;Ls are produced at least annually for statutory purposes (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>), many businesses will prepare more frequent and regular P&amp;Ls internally. Typically, P&amp;Ls are prepared monthly as part of a business’s management accounts (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter31.xhtml">Chapter 31 Management accounts</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_33"></a>Alternative performance measures (APM) have become more prevalent in company reports. APMs are non-GAAP (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and finance reporting standards</a></span>) measures. They are not defined in accounting standards and therefore open to interpretation. APMs must be given no more prominence than GAAP required figures and there must be a reconciliation of GAAP profit to the underlying amount showing each adjustment clearly. Two common APMs are explained below:</p>

<li class="box1"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Note that accounting standards have moved away from specifically defining ‘exceptional’ items. Any material item must be disclosed, either in the notes to the financial statements or, if necessary, on the face of the financial statements.

<h2 class="h2a">Alternative titles</h2>
<p class="noindent">The P&amp;L is known under a number of different titles. Here is a selection of the most common:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>The profit and loss account</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>The profit and loss statement</li>

<p class="noindent">Some of these titles are defined in company law and some by accounting regulations, depending on the jurisdiction. Some are historical, some are used internally only and many are used interchangeably.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Other income not shown in the P&amp;L</h2>
<p class="noindent">The P&amp;L records the revenue-producing activities of a company. For some companies there are non-primary or non-revenue producing activities which cause a change in <a id="gloss-83" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_83"><span class="italic">net assets.</span></a> Some examples are:</p>
<ul class="box">

<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Specific gains and losses from financial instruments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">There is very specific accounting regulation around these areas.</p>
<p class="noindent">Other income not shown in the P&amp;L is recorded in the ‘Statement of Other Comprehensive Income’, a separate financial statement, which typically appears after the P&amp;L.</p>
