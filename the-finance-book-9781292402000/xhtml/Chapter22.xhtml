<div class="box1">
<p class="box-ext"><span class="bold">‘The real mechanism for corporate governance is the active involvement of the owners.’</span></p>

<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="gloss-20" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_20"><span class="italic">Corporate governance</span></a> refers to the system by which companies are ‘managed’ (i.e. directed and controlled). ‘Good’ corporate governance prevents directors from making and taking decisions that benefit themselves to the detriment of the shareholders who appoint the directors to run the business on their behalf.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The UK has developed its corporate governance guidance over 30+ years. The UK Corporate Governance Code (The Code) is written as a set of <span class="italic">principles</span> and supporting <span class="italic">provisions</span> intended to guide directors on best practice to ensure long-term sustainable business success. The Code is applicable to all companies with a premium listing on the UK Stock Exchange. The directors are required to report annually how they have applied the principles and complied with supporting provisions of the Code. </p>
<p class="noindenta">The UK Code recognises the importance and need for a company’s workforce to be able to raise concerns about the operations of the business. <a id="gloss-122" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_122"><span class="italic">Whistleblowing</span></a> is the reporting of wrongdoing (e.g. fraud, illegality, or unethical practice) by an employee. A whistleblower disclosing information about wrongdoing is protected (in certain circumstances) by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Corporate Governance guidance continues to develop and evolve as new corporate failures provide additional insights and lessons on how to better manage and control business for the benefit of shareholders and stakeholders.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">Corporate governance</h2>
<p class="noindent">Corporate governance is a critical issue whenever there is separation between a company’s ownership and control.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">public</span> companies (plcs) it is almost always the case that the directors appointed to <span class="italic">run</span> a company are not the same as the shareholders who <span class="italic">own</span> the company. This creates an <span class="italic">agency</span> relationship in which shareholders, who typically are not involved in the day to day running of the business, have to rely on directors (‘agents’) to use their expertise to run the company for the benefit of the shareholders. This agency relationship creates a self-interest risk, namely that directors may take decisions that are in their own interests rather than the interests of those that they have been appointed to serve, i.e. shareholders.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">The UK Code</h2>
<p class="noindent">The UK Code sets out the UK’s approach to addressing this principal-agent risk. It is applicable to <span class="italic">premium listed</span> companies (the highest profile listing on the UK Stock Exchange). The Code itself has been subject to many updates over the 30-years since it was first issued. The Code has been shaped in particular by large-profile company failures, including high-profile corporate collapses such as Maxwell Communications and Polly Peck in the early 1990s, Northern Rock and RBS during the financial crisis of the late 2000s and more recently BHS, the UK fashion and homeware retailer.</p>
<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_218"></a>Principles and provisions</h2>
<p class="noindent">The Code contains <span class="italic">principles</span> and supporting <span class="italic">provisions</span> that aim to align the interests of directors with shareholders and other <span class="italic">stakeholders</span> (employees, customers, suppliers, pensioners etc.).</p>

<td class="tdleft">Listed companies should comply with the Code’s <span class="italic">provisions</span>. However, a company may depart from a provision where the directors believe an alternative is justified. Where a provision is not followed, the company should explain the reasons for non-compliance and how the alternative approach adopted is nevertheless consistent with the principles. This approach is referred to as ‘comply or explain’.</td>

<h2 class="h2a">Private companies</h2>
<p class="noindent">Until 2019, corporate governance guidance was focused only on listed companies. There was no requirement for <span class="italic">private</span> companies to follow the UK Code. Recent history has shown the harmful impact on stakeholders of the failure, not just of listed companies, but also large private companies. For example, the collapse of BHS (a large private company) in 2016, led to many thousands of employees losing their jobs and pension benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent">In response, new guidance known as ‘The Wates Code’ was introduced (in January 2019) specifically for large private companies. <span class="italic">Large</span> in this context means companies that employ <span class="italic">significant</span> numbers of staff (defined as more than 2,000 employees) or have a <span class="italic">significant</span> turnover (defined as more than £200m).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is hoped that by extending the principles of good corporate governance to large private companies, this will further reduce the risks of company failure, while at the same time increasing confidence amongst shareholders and stakeholders that their company is being well run.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Whistleblowing</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Whistleblowing</span> is the reporting of wrongdoing (e.g. fraud, illegality, or unethical practice) by an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whistleblowers are protected under law when a disclosure is made for the <span class="italic">public interest</span>. This protection is designed to encourage employees to speak out if they find malpractice in their organisation. The <a id="page_219"></a>Public Interest Disclosure Act (PIDA) 1998 protects employees from detrimental treatment or victimisation from their employer where they blow the whistle on wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The UK Code includes a requirement for boards to consider the adequacy of their whistleblowing procedures.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">A statement of compliance by directors is intended to give investors the confidence that they are applying best practice principles and operating in the best interests of the shareholders and with due regard to wider stakeholders.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Compliance with the principles of the Code is not a legal requirement but is required to comply with the UK Stock Exchange listing requirements. While Company directors are expected to apply the principles and explain any non-compliance with supporting principles, doing so does not ensure success. It is not a substitute for having a sound business strategy. Neither should it be assumed that non-compliance with one or more provisions indicates that the business will fail or suffer impropriety.</p>
<p class="noindent">According to Grant Thornton (a firm of auditors and advisers), only 59% of the largest listed UK Companies (UK FTSE 350) were fully compliant with the Code during 2020. In addition, only 32% of the companies provided a meaningful explanation to shareholders of how they had applied the principles.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">The journey</h2>
<p class="noindent">The UK Code represents a consolidation of three decades of developments and learning in corporate governance. Numerous committees have been set up over this time to provide and evolve guidance on how a company (the board) should be directed and <a id="page_220"></a>managed, directors’ compensation, strengthen financial reporting and audit, and improve communication with shareholders.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">A principles-based approach</h2>
<p class="noindent">The UK Code is written as a set of principles, to recognise that each business is unique and a ‘one size fits all’ approach is unlikely to work. The UK Code therefore requires adherence to the ‘spirit’ rather than the letter of the Code. Companies, while expected to apply the principles of the Code, are permitted to depart from the detailed provisions, provided they explain their reasons for departure. It is believed that a principles-based approach allows for greater flexibility, while avoiding the need to be overly prescriptive.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">A rules-based approach</h2>
<p class="noindent">The UK’s approach to corporate governance differs from other countries, most notably the US. There has never been a single unified corporate governance code for US listed companies. US listed companies are instead directed to follow rules contained within a number of Federal State regulations including The Securities Acts and ‘Sarbanes–Oxley’ (known as ‘Sarbox’). Unlike the UK, following these corporate governance regulations is a legal requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is argued that the requirement to follow regulations provides greater clarity and certainty over compliance. Conversely, flexibility is lost as there is no choice to apply regulations in a way that best reflects the nature of the organisation (e.g. to reflect the organisation’s size or stage of development).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Company directors</h2>
<p class="noindent">Companies are run by directors who take decisions at ‘main’ board meetings. These should be attended by all board directors (executive and non-executive). All directors must assume collective responsibility for the decisions and actions taken by the company.</p>
<p class="noindent">The UK Code recommends that a board comprising ‘executive’ directors should be supported by ‘non-executive’ directors (NEDs). <a id="page_221"></a>Executive directors, as their title suggests, take responsibility for the day-to-day management of the business, whereas non-executive directors have no day-to-day responsibility for the running of the business. Further, non-executive directors should preferably be <span class="italic">independent</span> outsiders appointed to represent the interests of shareholders and should have no recent dealings with the company. Independence can be compromised if the directors have personal or business interests in the company or if they are awarded remuneration beyond an agreed director’s fee. The purpose of non-executive directors is to act as the ‘eyes and ears’ of shareholders in the boardroom. Non-executive directors, in effect, help to bridge the ownership versus control (agency) disconnect that exists in large companies.</p>
<p class="noindent">Non-executive directors can however hold shares in the company and be considered independent.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Board committees</h2>
<p class="noindent">The Code recommends the main board be supplemented by three committees. Each committee is granted authority by the main board to focus on certain specific aspects of corporate governance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The main purpose of each of the three committees is summarised below:</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_222"></a>Note that the main board is not prevented from setting up other committees it may consider necessary. For example, many companies now have a risk committee set up to assist the Board in its oversight of the effectiveness of the company’s risk management practices.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Whistleblowing</h2>
<p class="noindent">Employees are often the first to notice irregularities because they work in (and are therefore closest to) the business. Whistleblowing, i.e. the reporting of wrongdoing, is considered an important mechanism to help ensure corporate governance is maintained. However, employees are not protected in all situations of disclosure. Employees are protected only if they make what are known as <span class="italic">qualifying disclosures</span> in the public interest. Qualifying disclosures are disclosures of information where an employee reasonably believes that one or more of the following matters has happened, is taking place, or is likely to happen in the future:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>a criminal offence</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>the breach of a legal obligation</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>a miscarriage of justice</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>a danger to the health and safety of any individual</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>damage to the environment</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>deliberate attempt to conceal any of the above.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Procedurally, an employee should make a disclosure to their employer, or if they feel unable to follow the organisation’s procedures, the disclosure should be made to a <span class="italic">prescribed person</span>. A prescribed person is a person (or body) included on the prescribed persons list published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The list includes MPs, Ofsted (education services), Care Quality Commission (health and social care services) and the Information Commissioner (data protection issues).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Stewardship Code</h2>
<p class="noindent">According to the Office for National Statistics (Statistical Bulletin/Ownership of UK quotes shares, 2018), only 13.5% of FTSE shares are owned by individuals. <span class="italic">Institutional shareholders</span>, including asset owners and asset managers such as pension funds, insurance <a id="page_223"></a>companies, banks and investment trusts, invest in shares on behalf of UK savers and pensioners (known as beneficiaries) and are equally significant holders of shares of UK Companies. As significant shareholders, they have an important role to play in ensuring good corporate governance by exercising their voting rights. Institutional investors have historically been criticised for being passive investors and not using their influence to look after the interests of their beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stewardship Code was established in 2010 (a new version was issued in 2020) to encourage asset owners and managers to become more active in company matters. The Stewardship Code contains a set of principles that focuses on sustainable value for beneficiaries, the economy and society, including making explicit reference to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.</p>
<p class="noindent">The structure of the new version of the Code is similar to the UK Corporate Governance Code, with numbered Sections, Principles and reporting expectations accompanied by Guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The new version of the Code sets expectations for how money should be invested on behalf of UK savers and pensioners and requires an engaged approach to stewardship and investment decision-making, which is aligned to the long-term investment time-horizons of beneficiaries.</p>
