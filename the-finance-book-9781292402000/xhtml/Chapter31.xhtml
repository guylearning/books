<p class="box-ext"><span class="bold">‘Two accountants are in a car. The financial accountant looks out the back window and records its journey. The management accountant is in the driving seat, plans where the car is going, how fast it is going and aligns its direction.’</span></p>

<div class="box2">
<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta">Management accounts are best understood by contrasting them with financial accounts.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Financial accounts report ‘what has happened’ in a business. Management accounts seek to explain ‘why it has happened’. </p>
<p class="noindenta">Financial accounts are required by law to report the historic financial results of a company to shareholders.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Management accounts are produced for operational purposes. They provide more timely and detailed information to company directors and managers, to help them run a business efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Management accounts analyse past and present information, both financial and non-financial, to help a company make more informed decisions about its future.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Management accounts are often produced by management accountants in a ‘pack’, sometimes referred to as the ‘monthly management pack’ or ‘management accounts pack’, hereafter MAP.</p>
<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_324"></a>Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">The success of a business is directly related to the quality of its decisions. To make quality decisions, businesses need access to timely, accurate, reliable, relevant and insightful information. The key source of information for a board of directors is the MAP.</p>
<p class="noindent">The role of finance is evolving in many organisations, moving beyond the traditional role of reporting historic financial information, into providing what is often referred to as ‘business partnering’ support. This is where finance helps management to understand the business through analysing financial and non-financial information, which in turn can help a business make better decisions. For example, while the financial accounts may report the turnover number as a single number, the MAP will break this number down by product and geography. This can enable management to identify which products and regions are the most (or least) successful and this, in turn, will help management focus future investment and attention. </p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2b">Frequency</h2>
<p class="noindent">Whereas financial accounts are produced annually (although listed companies will also release ‘interim’ or six-monthly accounts), MAPs are produced far more frequently.</p>
<p class="noindent">MAPs are typically produced monthly, although some companies may produce them more often, for example on a weekly, or even daily, basis. Although technology has enabled more companies to move closer to the ideal of real-time information, monthly MAPs are still common and will include other relevant management information (see the <span class="bold">Nice to know </span>section below) to be discussed at monthly board meetings. In addition, there is a difference between real-time data (which may just be numbers) and MAPs (which also include analysis and require professional judgement).</p>
<h2 class="h2b"><a id="page_325"></a>Time lag</h2>
<p class="noindent">For a large company, financial accounts can take weeks, if not months, to produce. This is mainly due to ensuring that all transactions are included, various required disclosures are made (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>) and audits are undertaken (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20 External financial audit</a></span>). In addition, it could be up to 9 months after the year end before the accounts are released into the public domain (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter21.xhtml">Chapter 21 Information in the public domain</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">As MAPs are used to run a business and make critical decisions it is essential that they are produced promptly. A well-organised accounting and finance function can produce MAPs within a few days following the month end. Timely information not only enables quicker decisions to be made but also enables issues and opportunities to be identified earlier.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2b">Requirement</h2>
<p class="noindent">Unlike financial accounts, which are a requirement under company law, there is no requirement to produce MAPs. While full MAPs will be common in large companies, they are less likely to be produced or cover the same breadth and depth in many SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). A factor in the success and growth of SMEs into large companies is likely to be the quality of its MAPs.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Format</h2>
<p class="noindent">While financial accounts are standardised through comprehensive accounting regulation (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>), there are no accounting standards for MAPs. Indeed, one of their key advantages is that they can be tailored to business needs. There are, however, some established conventions (see the <span class="bold">Nice to know</span> section below) and many MAPs follow the format of the primary financial statements.</p>
<h2 class="h2b"><a id="page_326"></a>Scope</h2>
<p class="noindent">Financial accounts summarise a whole business, even where there are many different products and/or services sold in different markets.</p>
<p class="noindent">MAPs can drill down into whatever detail is required, for example, divisions, departments, individual products, services, markets or customers.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Accuracy</h2>
<p class="noindent">Financial accounts need to be ‘true and fair’ and free from ‘material’ misstatements (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20 External financial audit</a></span>). Figures are often produced in £’000 or £m depending on the size of the company.</p>
<p class="noindent">As management accounts are used to make critical business decisions, they will usually need to be more accurate than financial accounts, depending upon the decision being made.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">The ideal MAP</h2>
<p class="noindent">The ideal MAP should be tailored and relevant to each company’s needs. It should be produced on a timely basis and contain the right quantity and quality of information, presented clearly and cost effectively.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Contents of a typical MAP</h2>
<p class="noindent">According to CIMA (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants) the ideal MAP should be between 10 and 20 pages and contain the following:</p>
<div class="box2">
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Executive summary identifying all key issues with a synopsis of KPIs (key performance indicators).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Action plan specifying corrective actions and contingencies with best- and worst-case scenarios.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>P&amp;L account showing period and cumulative positions with updated projections. Variances against budget <a id="page_327"></a>should be highlighted with major variances explained. Trend analysis should be shown graphically.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Projected profit recalculated on the basis of actual performance and action plans.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Profiled cash flow summarising actual and projected receipts, payments and balances on a regular basis to year end.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Analysis of progress of major capital schemes, showing percentage completion, current and projected expenditure, completion cost and timescale.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Balance sheet showing working capital position in tabular form or using performance indicators, e.g. debtor and creditor days.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="noindent">CIMA also emphasises that the MAP should be easy to assimilate and contain graphs, charts, colour-coding, clear headings and selective highlighting. CIMA suggests that supplementary information should be provided as an appendix only if it is vital to the board’s understanding of the report.</p>
<p class="noindent">Other useful contents for a MAP include:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Commentary. To add value, the MAP should ‘make the numbers talk’ and provide a ‘story’ of what has happened and its impact on projections.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>The order book and other ‘lead’ versus ‘lag’ indicators of performance.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Non-financial information. The MAP should not just contain financial information. Kaplan and Norton’s ‘Balanced Scorecard’ suggests balancing financial information with the following additional perspectives:
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Customer – for example new, repeat and lost customer data</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Internal business processes – for example productivity and efficiency measures</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Learning and growth – for example new product development and training.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_328"></a>As indicated in the <span class="bold">Need to know</span> section above, MAPs are not one size fits all, and their size, complexity and contents will differ from organisation to organisation, depending on the size of the company and the requirements of its users.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Extract of typical headings in a MAP</h2>
<p class="noindent">A MAP will typically contain detailed financial statements on a month-by-month and year-to-date (cumulative) basis.</p>
<p class="noindent">Benchmarks are useful to management in assessing performance and ‘actual’ results will usually be compared to budget, forecast (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter34.xhtml">Chapter 34 Budgeting and forecasting</a></span>) as well as prior year.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">Reconciliation between financial and management accounts</h2>
<p class="noindent">Financial and management accounts must ultimately reconcile. This is an essential control in business, especially when the information comes from different sources and MAPs are being used to make critical business decisions.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Enterprise resource planning (ERP) and spreadsheets</h2>
<p class="noindent"><a id="gloss-45" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_45"><span class="italic">ERP</span></a> is a system of integrated IT applications used to manage a business and automate many back-office functions, including accounting, supply chain, operations, manufacturing and human resources. ERP has made the production of MAPs much quicker and more efficient (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2 Finance personnel and systems</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Alongside the growth in ERP, technological developments such as CRM (customer relationship management), cloud computing and social media have increased the amount of data available for businesses to analyse. This has led to the emergence of new management accounting practices, such as:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">business intelligence</span>: the interpretation of raw data to explain performance</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">business analytics</span>: insights into performance from a continuous, iterative and methodical exploration of data and</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">big data</span>: computational analysis of very large data sets to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, such as customer behaviour and interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Spreadsheets still play a central role in the majority of management accounting departments. While ERP systems are established in many large organisations, they are less common in SMEs which largely rely on spreadsheets to produce MAPs. </p>
<p class="noindent">Most accounting systems are designed for processing transactions such as invoices and payments and therefore MAPs are often produced by importing data from these systems and ‘crunching’ the numbers in a spreadsheet.</p>
<h2 class="h2"><a id="page_330"></a>Reflect and embed your understanding <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Reflect.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="36"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">For an example organisation:</p>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span>Compare the annual financial statements with the MAP for the same period to highlight the differences in detail within each report. Which provides more valuable insight to management to enable decision making? </li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span>What is the most value adding part of your MAP?</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">3</span><span class="pad1"></span>What is the least value adding part of your MAP?</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">4</span><span class="pad1"></span>What would you like to see in your MAP that you currently don’t receive?</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">5</span><span class="pad1"></span>Does the MAP help to inform your business decisions?</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The MAP is an internal document and will not be published in the public domain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Banks (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter30.xhtml">Chapter 30 Debt finance</a></span>), Venture Capitalists and Private Equity (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter29.xhtml">Chapter 29 Equity finance</a></span>) may require a business to share MAPs as part of their financing arrangements.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Extract from Greggs plc 2020 annual report and accounts</h2>
<p class="noindent">Greggs plc have implemented and continued to develop an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in recent years. This system will be an essential tool in producing Greggs plc’s MAP.</p>
