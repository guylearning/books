<p class="noindenta">Prepayments and accruals are both examples of the ‘matching’ concept (somewhat confusingly also known as the ‘accruals’ concept) (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1 Business accounting</a></span>). The objective is to match expenses to the period in which they are incurred, as opposed to paid.</p>
<p class="noindenta">One of the key things to be aware of is the dual impact of accruals on a business’s financial statements.</p>

<p class="noindent">ABC Ltd’s accounting year is based on calendar years, whereas its insurance bill (which it pays annually in advance) runs from 1 July to 30 June. At 31 December, there will be 6 months of prepaid insurance which is not yet ‘used’. Therefore, there will be a prepayment equal to half of the amount paid.</p>

<p class="noindent">ABC Ltd pays its utility bills 3 months in arrears, at the end of January, April, July and October each year. At 31 December, the business will have 2 months of utility expenditure which will not be paid until 31 January, after its year end. It will, therefore, make an accrual for the 2 months of utilities received, not yet paid. This will be an estimate based on the previous quarter/year’s bill and current usage. </p>

<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Accruals are important as they impact on both the profit and loss (P&amp;L) and balance sheet (see the table above).</p>
<p class="noindent">The financial impact of accruals on profit is not always certain as accruals are often estimated. There should, however, be a sensible basis to their estimation. For example, a company which needs to estimate its electricity bill may look at meter usage compared to the previous quarterly bill, or simply use last year’s estimate as the basis for the accrual (if there has been no significant change in operating activity).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is important to be aware that accruals must be based on expenditure which the business will be making for goods and services which it has already received.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Businesses which prepare regular management accounts (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter31.xhtml">Chapter 31 Management accounts</a></span>) may calculate accruals and prepayments on a monthly as well as an annual basis. The most <a id="page_132"></a>important time, however, is at the financial year end as the final accrual will have an impact on year-end profit and the year-end tax calculation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Accruals can affect levels of profit between different years. Take the example of a particularly prudent accrual for legal fees in year one, which is overestimated by £1,000. This will have the impact of reducing year one’s profit by £1,000 and increasing year two’s profit by £1,000. This is because the over accrual is adjusted the following year to reflect actual expenditure, once the actual invoice is received.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>

<tr>
<td class="tdleft"><p class="paleft">Some services such as insurance, licences and rent will require upfront payment as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="paleft">However, there are other times when it may be advantageous to prepay for goods or services. For example:</p>
<ul class="box1">
<li class="box1"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Taking advantage of a volume purchase discount.</li>
<li class="box1"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Hedging against inflation by purchasing earlier rather than later.</li>
<li class="box1"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Building a relationship with a new supplier.</li>
</ul>
<p class="paleft">On the other hand, prepayments represent a cash outflow which has an associated finance cost. There is also the risk of becoming an unsecured creditor if the business in receipt of the prepayment becomes insolvent.</p></td>
<td class="tdleft"><p class="paleft">Accruals are effectively free credit for a business. For example, Contractor X takes one month to raise its invoice and Business Y pays its suppliers one month after receiving invoices. In this example Business Y has effectively received 2 months’ credit. For one month the debt will be classified as an accrual, and then once the invoice is raised the amount owed will be classified as a trade creditor.</p>
<p class="paleft">In practice, however, accruals result in more administration. The finance department will know the value of its trade creditors, as the accounting system will have a record of invoices received from suppliers (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2 Finance personnel and systems</a></span>).</p>
<p class="paleft">However, the finance department may not know about goods or services received which have not yet been invoiced. It will need to obtain information from operational staff at the period end to be aware of the full extent of its liabilities.</p>
<p class="paleft">Most well-controlled, established businesses will in practice have systems in place (for example, purchase orders) to identify where and when accruals are necessary.</p></td>

<h2 class="h2a">The income perspective</h2>
<p class="noindent">So far, this chapter has considered <span class="italic">expenditure,</span> both deferred (prepayments) and accrued (accruals).

<p class="paleft">In other words, income has been received (in the form of cash) but not yet earned (as the goods have not yet been delivered or the service has not yet been performed).</p>
<p class="paleft">As the income is not yet earned, this is recognised as a short-term creditor on the business’s balance sheet. There is a liability to a third party.</p>
<p class="paleft">Deferred income is good for cash flow.</p></td>
<td class="tdleft"><p class="paleft">Where a business has provided goods or services to a third party but not yet sent an invoice, this is treated as <span class="italic">accrued income</span> (or accrued revenue).</p>
<p class="paleft">As income has been earned, but not yet invoiced (or received), it is recognised as a short-term debtor (asset) on the business’s balance sheet.</p>
<p class="paleft">Professional service firms such as lawyers, and businesses working on long-term contracts such as builders, often have challenges managing working capital due to large volumes of ‘unbilled work-in-progress’ or accrued income.</p>
<p class="paleft">In practice, businesses should aim to minimise accrued income, and turn it into debtors instead by invoicing promptly and giving the debtors a set time to pay.</p></td>

<h2 class="h2a">Rule of thumb</h2>
<p class="noindent">An accrual often occurs before a receipt or payment. A deferral occurs after a receipt or payment.</p>
<h2 class="h2"><a id="page_134"></a>Optional detail <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Optional.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Accounting for prepayments and accruals</h2>
<p class="noindent">Accruals and prepayments are one of a number of period-end adjustments. Other typical adjustments include depreciation (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation</a></span>), amortisation (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10 Goodwill and other intangibles</a></span>) and bad debt provisioning (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12 Debtors and creditors</a></span>). A manual journal entry is typically made by an accountant to adjust the balances in the accounting records (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2 Finance personnel and systems</a></span>).</p>
