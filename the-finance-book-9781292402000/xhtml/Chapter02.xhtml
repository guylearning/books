<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta">The finance department is the central hub of many organisations. Most business functions have a relationship with finance and have some level of interaction with finance systems.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Finance personnel and systems help businesses function efficiently, support decision making and add real value.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Sound financial management is critical to the success of any organisation. It is one of the key differentiators between high performance and average performance within an industry.</p>
<p class="noindent">The most successful organisations invest in both finance personnel and management accounting systems. They understand that this pays dividends through better-quality information and ultimately improved business decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">An efficient and effective finance team can provide a value-added service to the rest of the business.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">The key deadline for finance is the financial year end when the statutory financial accounts are produced and subsequently published.<a id="page_12"></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The annual budgeting process (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter34.xhtml">Chapter 34 Budgeting and forecasting</a></span>) is when most non-accountants will have contact with ‘finance’.</p>
<p class="noindent">Most successful businesses will produce monthly management accounts (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter31.xhtml">Chapter 31 Management accounts</a></span>), although there is a trend towards real-time information as information is increasingly recorded and reported digitally.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">1. Finance personnel</h2>
<p class="noindent">The diagram below represents a typical structure of a finance department:</p>

<p class="alt-noindent">On the top is the finance director. Teams below the finance director are management accounting, financial accounting, and treasury teams. Key areas of the financial accounting team are accounts payable, accounts receivable, and payroll.</p>

</aside>
<h2 class="h2b">Finance director</h2>
<p class="noindent">The role of the FD (finance director) or CFO (chief financial officer) is to ensure the financial strategy is aligned with the business strategy. They are usually a board member. The FD has overall responsibility for the financial health of a business and closely monitors KPIs (key performance indicators) such as:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>profitability performance measures (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter23.xhtml">Chapter 23 Profitability performance measures</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>working capital and liquidity (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management</a></span>)<a id="page_13"></a></li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>long-term solvency performance measures (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter26.xhtml">Chapter 26 Long-term solvency performance measures</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>investor ratios (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter27.xhtml">Chapter 27 Investor ratios</a></span>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2b">Financial accounting (‘finance’)</h2>
<p class="noindent">The financial accounting team (often referred to as ‘finance’) is responsible for processing transactions and maintaining core accounting records. The ‘financial controller’ heads the team.</p>
<p class="noindent">Three key areas are:</p>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span><a id="gloss-3" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_3"><span class="italic">Accounts payable</span></a>: processing purchase orders, supplier invoices and paying suppliers (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12 Debtors and creditors</a></span>).</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">Accounts</span> <span class="italic">receivable</span>: processing sales invoices and collecting payments from customers (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12 Debtors and creditors</a></span>).</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">3</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">Payroll</span>: paying employees and associated taxes correctly and on time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Other financial accounting areas include:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>bookkeeping</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>fixed asset management (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>stock (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11 Stock</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>tax accounting (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8 Business tax</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>financial reporting (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>group accounting (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter16.xhtml">Chapter 16 Group accounts</a></span>)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>liaison with external auditors (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20 External financial audit</a></span>).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>investor relations (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter29.xhtml">Chapter 29 Equity finance</a></span>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2b">Treasury</h2>
<p class="noindent">A treasury team may also feature in finance departments of larger organisations. The treasury team’s responsibilities include:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>ensuring that the business does not run out of cash<a id="page_14"></a></li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>making the most effective use of any surplus cash</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>identifying sources of medium and long-term finance</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>managing relationships with banks and monitoring covenants on any loans</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>managing foreign exchange, for overseas operations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2b">Management accounting</h2>
<p class="noindent">The management accounting (MA) team monitors budgets, makes forecasts and provides the information to support financial decisions (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter31.xhtml">Chapter 31 Management accounts</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Every organisation will have its own structure. In smaller organisations many of these roles are combined. The smallest organisations may outsource their finance operations to a firm of accountants and/or engage a bookkeeper to produce accounts, as this may be more cost effective than setting up a finance department.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">2. Finance systems</h2>
<h2 class="h2b">Source documents <span class="font">(see <a href="#fig1-1">Figure 1: Source documents)</a></span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The majority of source documents are for the sales and purchase subsystems (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12 Debtors and creditors</a></span>) and include:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Purchase requisitions</li>

<h2 class="h2b">The nominal ledger <span class="font">(see</span> <span class="font"><a href="#fig1-3">Figure 3: Nominal ledger, trial balance and journals)</a></span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The <a id="gloss-85" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_85"><span class="italic">nominal ledger</span></a> is where all accounting transactions are recorded. Each transaction is allocated to a different nominal ‘account’ (or ‘code’) depending on its nature. The nominal ledger will sometimes be very detailed. For example, ‘sales’ may have an individual nominal account for every single product or service sold in every single geographical location. The level of detail depends on the size of company, its complexity and business requirements.<a id="page_17"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2b">The trial balance (TB) <span class="font">(see <a href="#fig1-3">Figure 3: Nominal ledger, trial balance and journals)</a></span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The <a id="gloss-116" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_116"><span class="italic">trial balance</span></a> is a list of every account in the nominal ledger and its associated ‘balance’ (or total), categorised into profit and loss account (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3 Profit and loss)</a></span> and balance sheet (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4 Balance sheet</a></span>) items.</p>

<p class="noindent">Authorised members of the financial accounting team will be responsible for making period-end <a id="gloss-74" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_74"><span class="italic">journals</span></a>. These are accounting adjustments to reflect timing differences relating to the accruals concept (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1 Business accounting</a></span>). Typical journals include:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Depreciation (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation</a></span>)</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="h2b">Draft financial accounts <span class="font">(see <a href="#fig1-4">Figure 4: Accounts)</a></span> </h2>
<p class="noindent">The ‘adjusted’ trial balance is used to produce the draft financial accounts which can be used internally,</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Management accounts and budgeting <span class="font">(see <a href="#fig1-4">Figure 4: Accounts)</a></span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The MA team will use the output from the finance system to prepare regular management accounts packs. These will include reports of performance against budget.</p>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of management accounts is to help internal stakeholders, such as company directors, run a business efficiently and effectively. Frequent and regular financial information is needed to make informed business decisions and to understand if the business is on track to meet its plans.</p>
<p class="noindent">Management accounts use past and present information (which also includes non-financial information), to help a company make informed decisions about its future (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter31.xhtml">Chapter 31 Management accounts</a></span>).<a id="page_19"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2b">Statutory accounts <span class="font">(see</span> <span class="font"><a href="#fig1-4">Figure 4: Accounts)</a></span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The draft financial accounts may be further adjusted to comply with accounting and financial reporting standards (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span>) before being published in a statutory format.</p>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of financial accounts is to report the historic financial results of a company to shareholders as well as other internal and external stakeholders (such as employees and creditors).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Historically, in manual accounting systems, transactions were recorded in ‘books’ and ‘ledgers’. These terms are still used despite the widespread prevalence of computerised accounting systems. Today there is a wide choice of off-the-shelf systems such as Sage, QuickBooks and Xero, which offer cloud-based versions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Large (and increasingly medium-sized) organisations are more likely to use ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems such as SAP and Oracle. These provide an integrated suite of subsystems which, besides finance, include supply chain management, production processing, customer relationship management, human resources and other areas of business management (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter31.xhtml">Chapter 31 Management Accounts</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">The growth in technology has seen ‘finance’ evolve from transaction processing and routine analysis towards providing financial analysis that can support decision making. Many large organisations may use shared service centres (a central department within a multidivisional organisation) to process routine transactions and undertake the more rudimentary aspects of accounting.</p>
<p class="noindent">Modern finance departments now focus on adding value as opposed to processing transactions. Accountants are increasingly looked to as finance business partners who can help the business to improve <a id="page_20"></a>decision making by providing financial insights into the historic performance of the business as well as forecasting future performance.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">System controls</h2>
<p class="noindent">All finance systems should have robust controls over human error and fraud. Examples of typical controls are given in the following table:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col class="colwidth50"/>
<col class="colwidth50"/>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Authorisation</td>
<td class="tdleft">All transactions and system inputs should be approved or authorised by an appropriate person. For example, purchase orders by a line manager.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Segregation of duties</td>
<td class="tdleft">Where possible, different personnel should be responsible for authorising, recording and reconciling transactions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Access controls</td>
<td class="tdleft">Passwords should restrict access. For example, only appropriate personnel can input information or access output information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Physical controls</td>
<td class="tdleft">Only authorised personnel have access to certain assets. For example, only authorised IT personnel can access the server room.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Input controls</td>
<td class="tdleft">For example, batch inputs and verification of customer/supplier codes against an authorised list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Reconciliations</td>
<td class="tdleft">Regular reconciliations, for example bank reconciliations and stock checks (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11 Stock</a></span>).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Budgets</td>
<td class="tdleft">Unexpected differences between budget and actual figures (known as variances) will highlight any potential errors (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter34.xhtml">Chapter 34 Budgeting and forecasting</a></span>).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Audit trails</td>
<td class="tdleft">A system log which tracks every change and who made the change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Backups</td>
<td class="tdleft">Regular backups kept offsite so the system can be restored to a prior state. Increasingly backups are typically held in the cloud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Contingency plans</td>
<td class="tdleft">For example, a disaster recovery plan in case of system failure or other hazards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Internal audit</td>
<td class="tdleft">Regular independent ‘internal’ reviews of systems and their controls (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20 External financial audit</a></span>).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Audit committee</td>
<td class="tdleft">A board committee comprising non-executive directors responsible for ensuring the integrity of the financial statements (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter22.xhtml">Chapter 22 Corporate governance and whistleblowing</a></span>).</td>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_22"></a>As well as the obvious internal benefits of strong controls, they should also enable an auditor to reduce the amount of testing required (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20 External financial audit</a></span>).</p>

<p class="noindent">Members of ICAEW, ICAS, ICAI and ACCA in the above list can register as external auditors.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are also a number of international accounting professional bodies. Some of these have mutual recognition arrangements with one or more UK professional bodies and this enables services to be provided across territories.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the UK specifically, the term ‘accountant’ is not restricted to practitioners fulfilling professional requirements, unlike professions such as solicitors and medical doctors. Therefore, it is strongly advised to check whether an accountant holds a professional qualification from one of the above bodies before engaging their services.<a id="page_23"></a></p>

<p class="noindenta">In 2015 we installed the infrastructure necessary to run SAP as our core Enterprise Resource Planning system and implemented the first module of this, going live with a new customer contact system in the fourth quarter. We are well advanced with plans to bring our existing finance processes into SAP in the first half of 2016. This will provide the platform on which we will build a suite of new capabilities across logistics, procurement, product lifecycle management and centralised ranging, forecasting and replenishment. We plan to trial improved processes around shop ordering in the latter part of the year.</p>
<p class="noindenta">We continue to be encouraged by the results of the programme, which is expected to make an annual net contribution of around £6.0 million once all the key functionality is in place, as well as making us more agile in terms of our ability to adopt further change in the future.</p>

<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_24"></a>Extract from Greggs plc 2020 annual report and accounts</h2>
<p class="noindent">In Greggs plc’s 2020 Annual Report and Accounts (p. 30), the chief executive’s report provided an update. An extract follows:</p>
<div class="box2">
<p class="box2a-title">Another big year for Project Sunrise – our major process and systems investment programme</p>
<p class="noindenta">During 2020, the project team continued the roll out of our SAP supply-chain solution, despite the disruption to the business caused by the global pandemic. In September, the team implemented the SAP system onto the bread rolls technology platform at our Enfield bakery. The team also implemented the manufacturing and logistics solution at our first combined site in Manchester in October 2020. In addition to this, we integrated our SAP system with one of our third-party logistics providers (The Ice Company). We are continuing to make good progress into 2021, with the aim of rolling out the system to the remainder of the supply chain by the end of the year.</p>

<p class="noindent">Within Greggs plc’s intangible assets note are software and assets under development.</p>
<p class="noindent">Assets under development relate to software projects arising from the investment in new systems platforms. When the software has been developed, it is transferred from assets under development into software.</p>
<p class="noindent">The note shows that during 2020 a further £0.1m was invested in development and £1.5m of development was completed and transferred into software.</p>
