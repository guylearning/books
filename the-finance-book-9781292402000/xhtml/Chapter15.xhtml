<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="italic">Capital</span> and <span class="italic">reserves</span> are found in the balance sheet. They represent the owners’ investment in a business. Together, capital <span class="italic">and</span> reserves are known as the owners’ ‘equity’ in the business.</p>
<p class="noindenta">(Share) <span class="italic">capital</span> is the nominal (face) value of the shares issued to shareholders.</p>
<p class="noindenta">There are two categories of <span class="italic">reserves</span>:</p>
<ul class="num1">
<li class="num1"><span class="ash3">1</span><span class="pad1"></span><a id="gloss-105" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_105"><span class="italic">Revenue</span></a> reserves – reflect retained profits, i.e. profits which have not been distributed to shareholders as dividends</li>
<li class="num1"><span class="ash3">2</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">Capital</span> reserves – reflect reserves created through <span class="italic">non-operating</span> activities. Capital reserves are created because of regulatory or accounting requirements. Examples include <span class="italic">share premium</span> and <span class="italic">revaluation reserve.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindenta">The distinction between <span class="italic">capital</span> and <span class="italic">revenue</span> reserves is important in law. Share capital plus <span class="italic">capital</span> reserves represent what is referred to as the ‘creditors’ buffer’ held by a company.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The creditor’s buffer preserves capital within the business. The buffer cannot be reduced or distributed except with special permission from the courts. Lenders and creditors are offered some protection should the business be unable to able to meet its liabilities.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2"><a id="page_148"></a>Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">(Share) capital</h2>
<p class="noindent">Ordinary shares, also known as equity shares, confer the rights of ownership in the company. Ordinary shareholders are the owners of the business (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter29.xhtml">Chapter 29 Equity finance</a></span>) as they and they alone have voting rights in the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whenever a company issues ordinary shares for consideration (typically cash), the sums received are recorded as capital. Where these shares are issued at a price above their face (nominal) value, a <span class="italic">share premium</span> reserve is created (see below). The share premium is a capital reserve and, together with the share capital, must be retained in the business as part of the creditors’ buffer.</p>
<p class="noindent">Capital invested in a business by a shareholder can <span class="italic">never</span> be paid back to the shareholder (except by court approval when liquidating a business). This may sound surprising, especially since many of us are used to buying and then selling shares (to recover sums invested) in publicly listed companies.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, it is important to distinguish between the monies received by the company and monies paid or received by those who hold the shares in a company.</p>
<p class="noindent">While shareholders may sell their shares in a company (through a stock exchange for listed companies or privately for unlisted companies), this reflects a <a id="gloss-108" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_108"><span class="italic">secondary</span></a> sale of shares that has no effect on a company’s finances. From the <span class="italic">company’s</span> perspective, the holder of shares is in effect re-selling their holding to a new shareholder. This change of shareholder therefore has no effect on the capital originally raised by the business. By way of analogy, if you sold a 20% share in a property that you own to a friend who in turn sold his share to a business associate (say, for a substantial profit), the result would be that you have a different investor owning 20% of your property. No additional money was raised by you because this is a <span class="italic">secondary</span> sale (the sale between your friend and the business associate) of the property.<a id="page_149"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2a">Reserves</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is important to note that both types of reserves, <span class="italic">revenue</span> and <span class="italic">capital,</span> belong to ordinary shareholders. However, the distinction is important because only revenue reserves are <span class="italic">distributable</span>, i.e. can be paid out in the form of dividends.</p>
<p class="noindent">A company’s profit and loss account is the principal revenue reserve held by any company and is created from the company’s revenue generating (operating) activities. Profits can be distributed legally from this reserve in the form of dividends to shareholders. Profits not distributed help to build up the (revenue) reserve, perhaps for future distribution. Alternative terms are used to describe revenue reserves including ‘accumulated profit’, ‘retained profit’ and ‘retained earnings’.</p>
<p class="noindent">In contrast to revenue reserves, capital reserves are not legally distributable. Once created, they must be retained to protect creditors. Capital reserves are created through non-operating activities such as the issue of shares or because of accounting measurement changes. Common capital reserves include those outlined in the following table:</p>

<td class="tdleft">New shares are issued to shareholders at a premium to nominal (face) value. Share premium reflects the <span class="italic">excess</span> (i.e. premium) paid over the nominal value of the shares (see also below).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Revaluation reserve</td>
<td class="tdleft">Company adopts a revaluation policy and its fixed assets increase in value, i.e. above purchase cost. The revaluation reserve records the increase (or decrease) in value of fixed assets (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter17.xhtml">Chapter 17 Revaluation</a></span>).</td>

<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">A company’s capital reserves provide an indication of financial security for lenders (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4 Balance sheet</a></span>). Creditors and providers of finance may look to the creditors’ buffer as evidence of security against lending.</p>
<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_150"></a>When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Directors must ensure they have sufficient revenue reserves to cover proposed dividend payments. Directors are legally prohibited from paying a dividend if that payment would have the effect of reducing the company’s net assets to a level below the <span class="italic">capital</span> reserves (plus share capital) balance. These regulations are known as the <span class="italic">capital maintenance rules</span> and exist to protect creditors by preventing directors and shareholders extracting too much cash from the company.</p>

<p class="noindent">Company A has net assets of £900 and £900 capital (comprising share capital and the share premium capital reserve). The company has no revenue reserves. Capital maintenance rules prohibit this company from paying dividends because it has no revenue reserves available. The creditors’ buffer of £900 cannot be used to pay dividends as it comprises capital reserves. The company has an excess of assets over liabilities providing security to creditors and lenders.</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite the legal protections, it is important for creditors and lenders to be aware that the capital maintenance rules do not guarantee that monies owed to creditor and lenders can be repaid. Where a company makes future revenue losses, the company’s <span class="italic">total</span> reserves will nevertheless get depleted despite the capital reserves not being distributed.<a id="page_151"></a></p>

<p class="noindent">The company now has net liabilities of £50 (£900 Year 1 net assets minus £950 Year 2 losses). The creditors’ buffer has been depleted as a result of making losses, <span class="italic">not</span> because of any distribution of profits. As a result lenders would be unable to recover their monies fully as the company now has <span class="italic">net</span> liabilities i.e. insufficient assets to pay liabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are further rules that seek to protect creditors when a company is <span class="italic">at risk</span> of becoming ‘insolvent’ (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25 Insolvency and going concern risk</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">It is highly unusual for a company to pay out all profits made in a year to shareholders as dividends. Companies typically set aside at least some of the profits to maintain or build up the company’s cash position. This has the following benefits:</p>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span>It provides additional security to creditors. Keeping reserves in the company helps to protect capital reserves against depletion (see example above).</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span>It provides an internal source of finance, i.e. working capital is retained in the business. Cash not paid out as dividends is in effect surplus money held by the business.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">3</span><span class="pad1"></span>It provides greater certainty that the company can pay dividends into the future. Some listed companies go further <a id="page_152"></a>and have what are known as ‘progressive’ dividend payment policies, in which directors set out the ambition to increase dividend per share year on year (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter27.xhtml">Chapter 27 Investor ratios</a></span>). Where earnings fall in any one year, having accumulated reserves can prevent dividends from being reduced or a progressive dividend policy being abandoned. In effect, accumulated reserves provide an insurance against ‘rainy days’, i.e. in years when a company is less profitable.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">4</span><span class="pad1"></span>To finance a specific future need. For example, a General Repairs Reserve can be created, setting monies aside to meet future repairs expenditure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Share capital</h2>
<p class="noindent">While different types of shares may be issued by a company, it is only ordinary shares that carry full rights of ownership.</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Ordinary shares confer full ownership rights in the business. Ordinary shares also carry the highest risk for the investor as there is no guarantee of a dividend and no promise of capital return. Ordinary shareholders are the last to be paid, should the company become insolvent (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25 Insolvency and going concern risk</a></span>). Conversely, the reward for carrying this risk is that, should the company be successful, all profits belong to ordinary shareholders and they therefore stand to earn the highest financial returns (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter29.xhtml">Chapter 29 Equity finance</a></span>).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Preference shares are another type of share that give some rights of ownership, such as preference in dividend payments. Preference shares are a means of raising capital without diluting the voting power of the ordinary shareholders. To compensate for the lack of voting power, the shares will generally have preferred rights over the ordinary shares, such as dividends as well as preference on liquidation (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25 Insolvency and going concern risk</a></span>). Preference shareholders typically receive a <span class="italic">fixed</span> dividend annually although, when a company is not profitable, a payment is not <a id="page_153"></a>made and the shareholders will have to forgo their dividends in that year. The shares nevertheless carry a lower risk than ordinary shareholders because, if the business is wound up, they rank ahead of (i.e. in preference to) ordinary shareholders in any payout (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25 Insolvency and going concern risk</a></span>).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">Cumulative</span> preference shares have similar rights to preference shares and have the added right that, if a dividend cannot be paid one year, the dividend due will be rolled up (accumulated) into the next year. Cumulative preference shareholders must be paid the accumulated dividends due when sufficient profits have been made by the company to cover the payment before any dividends are paid to ordinary shareholders.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="italic">Redeemable shares</span> are a particular type of share that give the right to the company to buy shares back at a future date. The date may be fixed or flexible and is usually determined by the business. Redeemable shares can be equity (ordinary shares) or non-equity (preference shares) in nature, although a company can only issue <span class="italic">redeemable</span> shares to raise new finance if it has (non-redeemable) ordinary shares already in issue.</li>

<h2 class="h2a">Capital reserves</h2>
<p class="noindent">Capital reserves are created in a variety of ways:</p>
<h2 class="h2b">1 Shareholder contribution</h2>
<p class="noindent">A share premium reserve is created when shares are issued by a company at a price higher than the nominal value of shares. For example, a company issuing 100 £1 nominal value shares at a price of £3 per share would create capital and reserves as follows:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col class="colwidth50"/>
<col class="colwidth50"/>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Share capital</td>
<td class="tdleft">£100 (100 × £1 nominal value)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Share premium</td>
<td class="tdleft">£200 (100 × £2 premium per share)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Total</td>
<td class="tdleft">£300</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 class="h2b"><a id="page_154"></a>2 Statute</h2>
<p class="noindent">Companies may be required to create capital reserves by law. For example, a company is required to create a <span class="italic">capital redemption reserve</span> in situations where it buys back and cancels a proportion of its shares. The capital redemption reserve consists of the nominal value of shares repurchased and cancelled by a company. The capital redemption reserve is established to ensure that the capital reserves in the business are maintained at the same level as before the buyback took place, in effect therefore maintaining the level of protection for creditors.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">3 Accounting requirements</h2>
<p class="noindent">Most other reserves result from accounting requirements to reflect <span class="italic">measurement changes</span> in equity rather than profit and loss. Typical reserves found in company balance sheets include:</p>
<ul class="alp">
<li class="alp"><span class="ash1">a</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="bold">Revaluation reserve</span> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter17.xhtml">Chapter 17 Revaluation</a></span>). Fixed assets can be revalued to fair value. A revaluation surplus is created as a result and is a capital reserve. It cannot be distributed, although a proportion of the reserve may be transferred annually to the profit and loss reserve and distributed as a dividend. The proportion that can be transferred is calculated as the difference between depreciation on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and depreciation based on the asset’s original cost.</li>
<li class="alp1">When a revalued asset is sold, any balance remaining in the revaluation reserve (relating to the asset sold) may be transferred to retained earnings and distributed as a dividend.</li>
<li class="alp"><span class="ash1">b</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="bold">Foreign currency translation reserve.</span> Foreign currency differences arising from converting (‘translating’) assets, liabilities, income and expenses from a foreign entity’s <span class="italic">functional</span> currency (the main currency used by the foreign entity) to the reporting currency result in the creation of a foreign currency reserve. This reserve arises in group accounting only. It is only on an eventual disposal of the overseas entity that any accumulated translation differences can be recognised as part of the profit or loss on sale of the entity.</li>
