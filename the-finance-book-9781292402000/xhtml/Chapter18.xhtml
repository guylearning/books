<p class="box-ext">‘<span class="bold">Today, we announced a fundamental restructuring of our phone business.

<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindentai">Impairment refers to a <span class="italic">permanent</span> loss in the income-generating potential of an asset.</p>
<p class="noindentai">A fixed asset is considered impaired when the worth to the business (known as ‘recoverable amount’) falls below its ‘carrying value’ in the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="noindentai">Fixed assets (tangible and intangible) with a finite useful economic life are assessed annually for evidence of impairment. An impairment test must be carried out when <span class="italic">indicators</span> of impairment exist.</p>
<p class="noindentai">Impairments result in an accounting loss that is reflected in the profit and loss account.</p>
<p class="noindentai">Goodwill is treated differently because it has an indefinite life. An annual impairment test must be carried out for goodwill irrespective of whether indicators of impairment exist (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10 Goodwill and other intangibles</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindentai">It is not always easy to identify whether an asset has suffered impairment.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Impairments are conceptually different to downward revaluations. Impairment accounting is not a matter of choice, whereas revaluation accounting is (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter17.xhtml">Chapter 17 Revaluation</a></span>). All <a id="page_176"></a>companies, whether they record assets at cost or market value, <span class="italic">must</span> reduce the carrying value of those assets when they have suffered an impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Knowing whether an asset has been impaired, however, is not always easy. External and internal <span class="italic">indicators</span> can be used to identify whether an asset may be impaired.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">External and internal indicators of impairment</h2>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Market value decline</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Adverse changes in technology, the economy, or laws</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Increase in market interest rates</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Obsolescence or physical damage to an asset</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Economic performance from an asset is worse than expected</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Asset lying idle.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">Examples</h2>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span>Introduction of Ultra Low Emission Zones (ULEZ) by major cities such as London. Such restrictions may prevent or impose penalty charges for vehicles entering ULEZ zones that do not meet the Euro 6 standards. This may affect the income-generating potential of non-compliant vehicles.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span>Boeing 737 Max fatalities. All 737 Max planes were grounded during 2018 and 2019 while investigations were conducted into the causes of the accidents. Airlines that acquired these planes were unable to operate them, directly affecting income generation.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">3</span><span class="pad1"></span>Many businesses were prevented from using property, plant and equipment as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The economic performance of these assets was adversely affected (see extracts from Greggs plc 2020 financial statements, below).</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">4</span><span class="pad1"></span>Airbus A380 superjumbo. The plane’s extremely large capacity had been designed for a system of travel in which it was assumed passengers would travel between central hubs before being taken to their onward destinations (a ‘hub and spoke’ <a id="page_177"></a>system). However, technological advances in the efficiency and range of newer aircraft has meant that passengers can increasingly travel using a ‘point to point system’, to get them to their destination in one flight, instead of two or three.</li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">5</span><span class="pad1"></span>Concorde supersonic plane. Following a fatal crash in the early 2000s the plane was consigned to the scrapyard. The asset suffered ‘impairment’ not because it had reached the end of its planned useful life but because of damage to its reputation, largely caused by safety concerns.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">An impairment results in the carrying value of an asset being reduced to its (lower) recoverable amount. The reduction in value is an accounting <span class="italic">loss</span> that must be recognised in the profit and loss account in the year of impairment. This is an application of the accounting concept of prudence (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6 Revenue recognition</a></span>)</p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">The risk of fixed assets being impaired must be considered annually. Directors, who are expected to know their business, must consider at the end of each accounting period whether assets held by the business could be impaired, by considering the indicators of impairment (see above). While the presence of indicators does not <span class="italic">prove</span> that an asset has suffered impairment, it does point to the <span class="italic">possibility</span> that the asset value may be impaired. In the case of finite-life fixed assets, this possibility is sufficient to trigger a detailed consideration and calculation to determine the asset’s recoverable value.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Calculating impairment</h2>
<p class="noindent">Impairment is the amount by which the carrying (book) value of an asset <span class="italic">exceeds</span> its recoverable amount<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Recoverable amount</span> is the worth of an asset to the business. ‘Worth’ is calculated as the <span class="italic">higher</span> of the asset’s <span class="italic">sale price</span> (i.e. fair value) less <a id="page_178"></a>cost of disposal, or its future <a id="gloss-39" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_39"><span class="italic">earnings potential</span></a> through continued use (known as ‘Value in Use’ or ‘VIU’) as shown below.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">Example 1</h2>
<p class="noindent">A company’s only asset, an item of plant and machinery, has a carrying value in the balance sheet of £100,000. The recoverable amount of the asset is calculated as £93,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The asset must be written down to the (lower) recoverable amount of £93,000.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">Example 2</h2>
<p class="noindent">A landlord owns a property currently worth £300,000 (market value). Future rental income (<span class="italic">VIU</span>) expected from continued use of the property is projected to be £350,000.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_179"></a>The recoverable amount is therefore £350,000 (i.e. higher of fair value and VIU).</p>
<p class="noindent">Assuming in this example that the property’s carrying value in the books was £400,000 then the property has suffered an impairment of £50,000 (£400,000 − £350,000). The asset’s carrying value will be reduced to £350,000 and an impairment loss of £50,000 will be recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Example 3</h2>
<p class="noindent">Following on from Example 2, if the market value were, say, £375,000 (and not £300,000), the recoverable amount would be £375,000 (as this is higher than the VIU).</p>
<p class="noindent">This would result in a lower impairment charge of £25,000 (£400,000 − £375,000).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Purchased goodwill</h2>
<p class="noindent">Unlike tangible fixed assets, purchased goodwill <span class="italic">must</span> be subjected to annual impairment testing because it is considered to have an <span class="italic">indefinite</span> life that is not subject to amortisation (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10 Goodwill and other intangibles</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because goodwill only arises on the purchase of one business by another, goodwill impairment testing involves the comparison of the cash flows for the acquired business every year to the cash flow forecasts used to support the carrying value of goodwill at the time of acquisition.</p>
<p class="noindent">Impairment testing in the first-year post acquisition led Microsoft to write down goodwill on acquisition of Nokia by $7.6bn (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10 Goodwill and other intangibles</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Saga, the insurer and cruise line operator, posted a £61m pre-tax loss for the year ended January 2021. This was largely due to a £60m goodwill impairment against its travel business, based on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<h2 class="h2"><a id="page_180"></a>Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Should there be a significant impairment in the value of an acquired business, the underlying assets of the business may be impaired also. Goodwill is eliminated first with any additional write down allocated on a pro-rata basis against remaining assets.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Example 3</h2>
<p class="noindent">D Ltd acquired ABC business at the start of last year for £250,000. The fair value of the assets at acquisition was £200,000. Goodwill on acquisition of £50,000 (£250,000 – £200,000) was recognised in the books of the buyer.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following a recent impairment test, the VIU of ABC is now estimated to be £180,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The impairment loss of <span class="bold">£70,000</span> (£250,000 − £180,000) is set off against goodwill first and then against the remaining assets, as follows:</p>

<p class="noindent">Because impairment results in a lower carrying value of an asset, depreciation (or amortisation) charges will consequently be based on a (lower) carrying value in the balance sheet and therefore be lower following any impairment.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Impairment tests compare the carrying value of an <span class="italic">individual</span> asset to the recoverable amount of that asset. VIU forecasts should therefore be based on cash flows generated by <span class="italic">each</span> asset. In practice it is very difficult to assign future earnings or cash flows to a <span class="italic">single</span> asset. Even a small business, such as a car repair garage, whose assets might only comprise a premises and plant &amp; equipment, would find it difficult to identify the cash flows generated by each asset individually, i.e. to the exclusion of other assets of the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">The VIU of assets are therefore typically considered together as a ‘cash generating unit’ (CGU) because this represents the smallest collection of assets that generate an income stream.<a id="page_181"></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Any impairment is allocated to the CGU’s assets <span class="italic">proportionately.</span></p>
<h2 class="h2a">Example 4</h2>
<p class="noindent">ABC is a motor garage with assets totalling £200,000 (comprising building £180,000, plant and equipment £20,000). The value in use (recoverable amount) is estimated at £180,000.</p>
<p class="noindent">The impairment loss is £20,000 (£200,000 − £180,000)</p>
<p class="noindent">The impairment is allocated against assets in <span class="italic">proportion</span> to their original carrying value<span class="italic">,</span> as follows:</p>

<p class="noindent">If an asset subsequently recovers in value, then impairment losses can be reversed (although these are subject to certain limits). For finite-life assets impairments may not therefore be permanent.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in the case of goodwill, an impairment loss, once recognised, can never be reversed.</p>

<p class="box-exth">Impairment</p>
<p class="noindenta">Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For example, shop fittings and right-of-use assets may be impaired if sales in that shop fall. When a review for impairment is conducted the recoverable amount is estimated based on either value-in-use calculations or fair value less costs of disposal. Both value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal calculations require management to estimate future cash flows generated by the assets and an appropriate discount rate. Consideration is also given to whether the impairment assessments made in prior years remain appropriate based on the latest expectations in respect of recoverable amount. Where it is concluded that the impairment has reduced, a reversal of the impairment is recorded.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Covid-19 crisis has meant that all shops have had periods of no, or reduced, sales and the rate of recovery of sales is inherently uncertain. This is considered to be an impairment trigger and as a result all assets in company-managed shops have been tested for impairment.</p>
<p class="noindenta">As a result of the crisis and following the shutdown period a decision was made not to reopen 38 shops. All shop fittings and right-of-use assets in these shops have been fully impaired (with no significant degree of estimation required) at a cost of £5.3 million (of which £2.5 million relates to fixtures and fittings and £2.8 million relates to right-of-use assets). In addition, a provision of £2.5 million was made for onerous costs and dilapidations directly related to these closures which is expected to be utilised over the remaining term of these shop leases. The assumptions regarding the lease term in respect of these shops were reviewed and where required the lease liability was remeasured before assessing the shop for impairment.</p>
<p class="noindenta">For the remainder of the estate an impairment review was carried out using the following assumptions:</p>
<ul class="hyp">
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad2"></span>Shops have been categorised into different catchment areas (e.g. city centres, transport hubs) and assumptions made on the rate of like-for-like sales recovery for each catchment;</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad2"></span>Like-for-like sales have been assumed to grow from December 2020 levels to a level six per cent lower than pre-Covid-19 levels (on average across the estate) by the end of 2021, then continuing to grow to pre-lockdown levels by December 2022, with a further one per cent growth per annum beyond that through to 2027. Where shops are used to fulfil online orders, the revenues from fulfilling these are included within the estimated cash flows for the shop;</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad2"></span>The like-for-like sales recovery assumes temporary national lockdown restrictions (i.e. schools and non-essential retail closed) for the whole of Q1 2021, with further temporary lockdowns in November 2021 and February 2022. For those periods it is assumed that Greggs would trade at a sales level consistent with its recent experience of these conditions;<a id="page_183"></a></li>
