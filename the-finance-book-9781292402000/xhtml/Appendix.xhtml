<p class="box2a-title"><a id="page_450"></a>Notes to the consolidated accounts</p>
<p class="box3-title">Significant accounting policies</p>
<p class="noindenta">Greggs plc (“the Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The Group accounts consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group”). The results of the associate are not consolidated on the grounds of materiality. The Parent Company accounts present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The accounts were authorised for issue by the Directors on 16 March 2021.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(a) Statement of compliance</p>
<p class="noindenta">Both the Parent Company accounts and the Group accounts have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group accounts, International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (‘IFRSs as adopted by the EU’). On publishing the Parent Company accounts here together with the Group accounts, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved accounts.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(b) Basis of preparation</p>
<p class="noindenta">The accounts are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest £0.1 million, and are prepared on the historical cost basis except the defined benefit pension asset/liability, which is recognised as the fair value of the plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Directors’ report and strategic report on pages 2 to 53. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the financial review on pages 41 to 44. In addition, Note 2 to the accounts includes: the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Group chose not to restate business combinations prior to the IFRS transition date (1 January 2004), as no significant acquisitions had taken place during the previous ten years. The Group’s policy up to and including 1997 was to eliminate goodwill arising upon acquisitions against reserves. Under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3, such goodwill remains eliminated against reserves.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently throughout the Group and to all years presented in these consolidated accounts except if mentioned otherwise. From 29 December 2019 the following amendments were adopted by the Group:</p>
<ul class="hyp">
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards;</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of Material; and</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>Amendment to IFRS 16 Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindenta">Their adoption did not have a material effect on the accounts. The Group chose not to use the practical expedient available in the amendment to IFRS 16.</p>
<p class="box3b-title">Restatement of comparatives</p>
<p class="noindenta">Due to a change in accounting policy there has been a prior-year restatement of deferred tax balances as a result of an agenda decision issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) in May 2020 which clarified the accounting for deferred tax when the recovery of the carrying amount of an asset gives rise to multiple tax consequences. In these situations, the Company previously assessed the net position for recoverability but following the IFRIC agenda decision is now required to consider the tax consequences separately and as a result a deferred tax asset of £5.7 million relating to buildings which previously qualified for industrial buildings allowances that was first recognised in 2008 has been derecognised in the opening position for the comparative period due to not being considered recoverable. This deferred tax asset of £5.7 million remains unrecognised at 2 January 2021.</p>
<p class="noindenta">This restatement has resulted in the following balance sheet changes whereby deferred tax is adjusted by £5.7 million, resulting in derecognition of the previous deferred tax asset and recognition of a deferred tax liability, and retained earnings reduced by £5.7 million. There is no impact on profit and loss or earnings per share in either the current or the prior year.<a id="page_451"></a></p>

<p class="noindenta">The accounting policy for deferred tax has been updated to reflect that when the recovery of the carrying amount of an asset gives rise to multiple tax consequences which are not subject to the same income tax laws, separate temporary differences are identified, and the deferred tax on these is accounted for separately, including assessment of the recoverability of any deferred tax assets that arise.</p>
<p class="box3b-title">Going concern</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Directors have considered the adoption of the going concern basis of preparation for these accounts in the context of the continued uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on the trading performance of the Group. At the end of the reporting period the Group had available liquidity comprised of cash and cash equivalents plus an undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF) (which is committed to December 2023) totalling £106.8 million. The RCF covenants relate to maximum borrowing levels and minimum liquidity for the 2021 financial year, thereafter they relate to maximum leverage and a minimum fixed charge cover. How these covenants are measured and the required ratios are set out in Note 2.</p>
<p class="noindenta">In 2020 it was necessary to protect the cash position of the Group whilst the additional credit facilities were put in place. Dividends and capital expenditure were temporarily stopped along with any non-essential expenditure. Government support for job retention was accessed and the Company benefitted from business rate relief.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Directors have reviewed cash flow forecasts - which include severe but plausible downsides - prepared for a period of 12 months from the date of approval of these accounts as well as covenant compliance for that period.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The forecasts assume that:</p>
<ul class="hyp">
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>the Covid-19 pandemic requires two months of further lockdown restrictions in November 2021 and February 2022, during which the Company continues to trade as it has done during the most recent periods of lockdown restrictions (i.e. its shops remain open albeit trading at reduced levels);</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>there is a gradual recovery in sales levels outside of the restricted periods, which the Group has modelled based on experience in the second half of 2020;</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>no further government support is utilised (including for periods where continued availability of support has already been announced);</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindenta">In this scenario the Group is able to operate without needing to draw on its existing committed lending facility and without taking mitigating actions such as reducing capital expenditure and other discretionary spend.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Directors further considered a more severe scenario where the Group suffers from a brand-damaging food scare resulting in a significant sales reduction in addition to the downside assumptions described above. In this scenario the Group would take mitigating actions in respect of capital expenditure and other discretionary spend. This forecast scenario shows a possible requirement to draw on the RCF but no breaches of the covenants linked to it.</p>
<p class="noindenta">After reviewing these cash flow forecasts and considering the continued uncertainties and mitigating actions that can be taken, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. After making enquiries, the Directors are confident that the Company and the Group will have sufficient funds to continue to meet their liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.<a id="page_452"></a></p>
<p class="box3b-title">Key estimates and judgements</p>
<p class="noindenta">The preparation of financial information in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.</p>
<p class="box3b-title"><span class="italic">Impairment</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For example, shop fittings and right-of-use assets may be impaired if sales in that shop fall. When a review for impairment is conducted the recoverable amount is estimated based on either value-in-use calculations or fair value less costs of disposal. Both value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal calculations require management to estimate future cash flows generated by the assets and an appropriate discount rate. Consideration is also given to whether the impairment assessments made in prior years remain appropriate based on the latest expectations in respect of recoverable amount. Where it is concluded that the impairment has reduced, a reversal of the impairment is recorded.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Covid-19 crisis has meant that all shops have had periods of no, or reduced, sales and the rate of recovery of sales is inherently uncertain. This is considered to be an impairment trigger and as a result all assets in company-managed shops have been tested for impairment.</p>
<p class="noindenta">As a result of the crisis and following the shutdown period a decision was made not to reopen 38 shops. All shop fittings and right-of-use assets in these shops have been fully impaired (with no significant degree of estimation required) at a cost of £5.3 million (of which £2.5 million relates to fixtures and fittings and £2.8 million relates to right-of-use assets). In addition, a provision of £2.5 million was made for onerous costs and dilapidations directly related to these closures which is expected to be utilised over the remaining term of these shop leases. The assumptions regarding the lease term in respect of these shops were reviewed and where required the lease liability was remeasured before assessing the shop for impairment.</p>
<p class="noindenta">For the remainder of the estate an impairment review was carried out using the following assumptions:</p>
<ul class="hyp">
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>Shops have been categorised into different catchment areas (e.g. city centres, transport hubs) and assumptions made on the rate of like-for-like sales recovery for each catchment;</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>Like-for-like sales have been assumed to grow from December 2020 levels to a level six per cent lower than pre-Covid-19 levels (on average across the estate) by the end of 2021, then continuing to grow to pre-lockdown levels by December 2022, with a further one per cent growth per annum beyond that through to 2027. Where shops are used to fulfil online orders, the revenues from fulfilling these are included within the estimated cash flows for the shop;</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>The like-for-like sales recovery assumes temporary national lockdown restrictions (i.e. schools and non-essential retail closed) for the whole of Q1 2021, with further temporary lockdowns in November 2021 and February 2022. For those periods it is assumed that Greggs would trade at a sales level consistent with its recent experience of these conditions;</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>Earning before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rent (‘EBITDAR’) is used as a proxy for net cash flow excluding rental payments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindenta">The base figures are assumed to include any potential impacts of Brexit;</p>
<ul class="hyp">
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’) with an uplift for risk in the current environment and at 2 January 2021 was 6.7 per cent (28 December 2019: 5.4 per cent); and</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>Consideration of the appropriate period over which to forecast cash flows including with regard to the remaining lease term.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindenta">On the basis of these calculations an impairment provision of £8.7 million has been made in respect of 87 shops (of which £2.7 million relates to fixtures and fittings and £6.0 million relates to right-of-use assets).</p>
<p class="noindenta">Given the uncertainties of the current trading environment, the sensitivities of these assumptions on the impairment calculation have been tested:</p>
<ul class="hyp">
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>A one per cent increase in the discount rate would result in an additional provision of £0.7 million, covering a further ten properties. A one percent decrease in the discount rate would result in a reduction in the provision of £0.6 million, with six fewer properties impaired;</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>A five per cent per annum increase in the sales recovery assumption would result in a reduction in the provision of £3.7 million with 26 fewer shops impaired. A five per cent decrease in the sales recovery assumption would result in an additional provision of £6.4 million with a further 41 properties impaired; and<a id="page_453"></a></li>

<p class="box3b-title"><span class="italic">Determining the rate used to discount lease payments</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">At the commencement date of property leases the lease liability is calculated by discounting the lease payments. The discount rate used should be the interest rate implicit in the lease. However, if that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for property leases, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. As the Group had no suitable external borrowings from which to determine that rate, judgement is required to determine the incremental borrowing rate to be used. At the start of each month a risk-free rate is obtained, linked to the length of the lease and an adjustment is then made to reflect credit risk. For the lease liabilities at 2 January 2021 a 0.1 per cent change in the discount rate used would have adjusted the total liabilities by £1.2 million.</p>
<p class="box3b-title"><span class="italic">Determining the lease term of property leases</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">At the commencement date of property leases the Group normally determines the lease term to be the full term of the lease, assuming that any option to break or extend the lease is unlikely to be exercised and it is not reasonably certain that the Group will continue in occupation for any period beyond the lease term. Leases are regularly reviewed and will be revalued if it becomes reasonably certain that a break clause or option to extend the lease is exercised.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Previously, the Group classified property leases as operating leases under IAS 17. The leases typically run for a period of 10 or 15 years. In England, the majority of its property leases are protected by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (LTA) which affords protection to the lessee at the end of an existing lease term.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Judgement is required in respect of those property leases where the current lease term has expired but the Group remains in negotiation with the landlord for potential renewal. Where the Group believes renewal to be reasonably certain and the lease is protected by the LTA it will be treated as having been renewed at the date of termination of the previous lease term and on the same terms as the previous lease. Where renewal is not considered to be reasonably certain the leases are included with a lease term which reflects the anticipated notice period under relevant legislation. The lease will be revalued when it is renewed to take account of the new terms. As at 2 January 2021 the financial effect of applying this judgement was an increase in recognised lease liabilities of £31.9 million (2019: £41.3 million).</p>
<p class="box3b-title"><span class="italic">Treatment of items as exceptional</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">The accounts for both the current and the prior year include items which are material and unusual in nature and which are considered to be of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement. These items include the decision to invest in and reshape the Company’s supply chain, with a multi-year, known budget project, in order to support future growth. Judgement is required in ensuring that only items that relate directly to this activity are separately presented. Further details of items treated as exceptional are given in Note 4.</p>
<p class="box3b-title"><span class="italic">Post-retirement benefits</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">The determination of the defined benefit obligation of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme depends on the selection of certain assumptions with significant estimation uncertainty including the discount rate, inflation rate, mortality rates and commutation. Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future years. The key assumptions, sensitivities and carrying amounts for 2020 are given in Note 21.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(c) Basis of consolidation</p>
<p class="noindenta">The consolidated accounts include the results of Greggs plc and its subsidiary undertakings for the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2021. The comparative period is the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(i) Subsidiaries</p>
<p class="noindentai">Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.<a id="page_454"></a></p>
<p class="box3c-title">(ii) Associates</p>
<p class="noindentai">Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 per cent of the voting power of another entity unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case. At the year end the Group has one associate which has not been consolidated on the grounds of materiality (see Note 13).</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation</p>
<p class="noindentai">Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated accounts.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(d) Exceptional items</p>
<p class="noindenta">Exceptional items are defined as items of income and expenditure which are material and unusual in nature and which are considered to be of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement. Any future movements on items previously classified as exceptional will also be classified as exceptional.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(e) Foreign currency</p>
<p class="noindenta">Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(f) Intangible assets</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Group’s only intangible assets relate to software and the cost of its implementation which are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are five to seven years.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Assets in the course of development are recategorised and amortisation commences when the assets are available for use.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(g) Leases</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(i) Lease recognition</p>
<p class="noindentai">At inception of a contract the Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.</p>
<p class="noindentai">For leases of properties in which the Group is a lessee, it has applied the practical expedient permitted by IFRS 16 and will account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(ii) Right-of-use assets</p>
<p class="noindentai">The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life or the lease term on a straight-line basis. Right-of-use assets are subject to, and reviewed regularly for, impairment. Depreciation on right-of-use assets is included in selling and distribution costs in the consolidated income statement.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(iii) Lease liabilities</p>
<p class="noindentai">At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term. Lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable and variable lease payments that depend on an index <a id="page_455"></a>or rate. Any variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.</p>
<p class="noindentai">In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Generally the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. When there are no external borrowings, judgement would be required to determine an approximation, calculated based on UK Government Gilt rates of an appropriate duration and adjusted by an indicative credit premium.</p>
<p class="noindentai">After the commencement date, the lease liability is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term or a change in the fixed lease payments. Interest charges are included in finance costs in the consolidated income statement.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(iv) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets</p>
<p class="noindentai">The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of machinery and equipment that have a lease term of less than 12 months and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments relating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(v) Variable lease payments</p>
<p class="noindentai">Some property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales generated from a shop. For individual shops, up to 100 per cent of lease payments are on the basis of variable payment terms. These payments are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the condition that triggers them occurs.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(h) Property, plant and equipment</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(i) Owned assets</p>
<p class="noindentai">Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy (l)). The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(ii) Subsequent costs</p>
<p class="noindentai">The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying value of the replaced component is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(iii) Depreciation</p>
<p class="noindentai">Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost (less residual value) of each item of property, plant and equipment during its expected useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods:</p>

</table>
<p class="noindentai">Freehold land is not depreciated.</p>
<p class="noindentai">Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values (if not insignificant) are reassessed annually.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(iv) Assets in the course of construction</p>
<p class="noindentai">These assets are recategorised and depreciation commences when the assets are available for use.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(i) Investments</p>
<p class="noindenta">Non-current investments comprise investments in subsidiaries and associates which are carried at cost less impairment.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Current investments comprise fixed-term, fixed-rate bank deposits where the term is greater than three months.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(j) Inventories</p>
<p class="noindenta">Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling <a id="page_456"></a>expenses. The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and direct production labour costs.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(k) Cash and cash equivalents</p>
<p class="noindenta">Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash at bank, in hand, debit and credit card receivables and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(l) Impairment</p>
<p class="noindenta">The carrying amounts of the Group and Company’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Impairment reviews are carried out on an individual shop basis.</p>
<p class="noindenta">An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in prior years are assessed at each reporting date and reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(m) Non-current assets held for sale</p>
<p class="noindenta">Non-current assets that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets are remeasured in accordance with the Group and Company’s accounting policies. Thereafter generally the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Once classified as held for sale assets are no longer depreciated or amortised.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(n) Share capital and reserves</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(i) Repurchase of share capital</p>
<p class="noindentai">When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares that are held in the employee share ownership plan are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(ii) Dividends</p>
<p class="noindentai">Dividends are recognised as a liability when the Company has an obligation to pay and the dividend is no longer at the Company’s discretion.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(iii) Distributable reserves</p>
<p class="noindentai">All Parent Company retained earnings are distributable and are the only such reserves.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(o) Employee share ownership plan</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Group and Parent Company accounts include the assets and related liabilities of the Greggs Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). In both the Group and Parent Company accounts the treasury shares held by the EBT are stated at cost and deducted from total equity.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(p) Employee benefits</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(i) Short-term employee benefits</p>
<p class="noindentai">Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be measured reliably.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(ii) Defined contribution plans</p>
<p class="noindentai">Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement when they are due.<a id="page_457"></a></p>
<p class="box3c-title">(iii) Defined benefit plans</p>
<p class="noindentai">The Company’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) is deducted. The Company determines the net interest on the net defined benefit asset/liability for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit asset/liability.</p>
<p class="noindentai">The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA, that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Company’s obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.</p>
<p class="noindentai">Remeasurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest). The Company recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in the income statement.</p>
<p class="noindentai">When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.</p>
<p class="noindentai">The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(iv) Share-based payment transactions</p>
<p class="noindentai">The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of share options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date, using an appropriate model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted, and is spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(v) Termination benefits</p>
<p class="noindentai">Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of the date at which the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of these benefits and the date at which the Group recognises costs for a restructuring. If benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date they are discounted.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(q) Provisions</p>
<p class="noindenta">A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(i) Restructuring</p>
<p class="noindentai">A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(ii) Onerous contracts</p>
<p class="noindentai">Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the contract obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the contract. At this point and before a provision is established the Group recognises any impairment loss on the associated assets.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(iii) Dilapidations</p>
<p class="noindentai">The Group provides for property dilapidations, where appropriate, based on the future expected repair costs required to restore the Group’s leased buildings to their fair condition at the end of their respective lease terms, where it is considered a reliable estimate can be made.<a id="page_458"></a></p>
<p class="box3a-title">(r) Revenue</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(i) Retail sales</p>
<p class="noindentai">Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised as income on receipt of cash or card payment. Revenue is measured net of discounts, promotions and value added taxation. Revenue from delivery services is included in retail sales and recognised on delivery.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(ii) Franchise sales</p>
<p class="noindentai">Franchise sales are recognised when goods are delivered to franchisees. Additional franchise royalty fee income, generally calculated as a percentage of gross sales income, is recognised in line with the franchisees’ product sales in accordance with the relevant agreement. Pre-opening capital fit-out costs are recharged to the franchisee and represent a key performance obligation of the overall franchise sales agreement. These recharges are recognised as income on completion of the related fit-out. Sales are invoiced to customers in credit terms of less than three months.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(iii) Wholesale sales</p>
<p class="noindentai">Wholesale sales are recognised when goods are delivered to customers. Separate disclosure of wholesale sales is not made where the information disclosed would be commercially sensitive, e.g. if there is a single wholesale customer. Sales are invoiced to customers in credit terms of less than three months.</p>
<p class="box3c-title">(iv) Loyalty programme/gift cards</p>
<p class="noindentai">Amounts received for gift cards or as part of the loyalty programme are deferred. They are recognised as revenue when the Group has fulfilled its obligation to supply products under the terms of the programme or when it is no longer probable that these amounts will be redeemed. Where customers are entitled to a free product after a set number of purchases under the loyalty programme, a proportion of the consideration received is deferred so that the revenue is recognised evenly across all of the linked transactions.</p>
<p class="noindentai">The nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues arising from the above transaction types do not differ significantly from each other.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(s) Government grants</p>
<p class="noindenta">Government grants are recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is a reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised net of the related expenses in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are incurred. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the income statement over the useful life of the asset.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(t) Finance income and expense</p>
<p class="noindenta">Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(u) Income tax</p>
<p class="noindenta">Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used in the calculation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. When the recovery of the carrying amount of an asset gives rise to multiple tax consequences which are not subject to the same income tax laws, separate temporary differences are identified, and the deferred tax on these is accounted for separately, including assessment of the recoverability of any deferred tax assets that arise.<a id="page_459"></a></p>
<p class="noindenta">Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="noindenta">A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related deferred tax benefit will be realised.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(v) Research and development</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Company continuously strives to improve its products and processes through technical and other innovation. Such expenditure is typically expensed to the income statement when the related intellectual property is not capable of being formalised or capitalised within intangible assets.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">(w) IFRSs available for early adoption not yet applied</p>
<p class="noindenta">The following amendments to standards which will be relevant to the Group were available for early adoption but have not been applied in these accounts:</p>
<ul class="hyp">
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (effective date 1 January 2021).</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindenta">Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the accounts.</p>
<p class="box3a-title">1 Segmental analysis</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Board is considered to be the ‘chief operating decision-maker’ of the Group in the context of the IFRS 8 definition. In addition to its company-managed retail activities, the Group generates revenues from its business to business (‘B2B’) channel which includes franchise and wholesale activities. With the reduction in the level of company-managed retail activities during 2020 both channels are now categorised as reportable segments for the purposes of IFRS 8.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Company-managed retail activities - the Group sells a consistent range of fresh bakery goods, sandwiches and drinks in its own shops or via delivery channels. Sales are made to the general public on a cash basis. All results arise in the UK.</p>
<p class="noindenta">B2B channel - the Group sells products to franchise and wholesale partners for sale in their own outlets as well as charging a licence fee to franchise partners. These sales and fees are invoiced to the partners on a credit basis. All results arise in the UK.</p>
<p class="noindenta">In the current year the Board has regularly reviewed the revenues of each segment separately. A review of trading profit for each segment was not possible as there was no basis on which meaningfully to allocate costs during the period when the company-managed shops were closed. The Board receives information on overheads, assets and liabilities on an aggregated basis consistent with the Group accounts.</p>

<p class="box3a-title">2 Financial risk management</p>
<p class="box3b-title">Credit risk</p>
<p class="noindenta">Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Retail sales represent a large proportion of the Group’s sales and present no credit risk as they are made for cash or card payments. The Group does offer credit terms on sales to its wholesale and franchise customers. In such cases the Group operates effective credit control procedures in order to minimise exposure to overdue debts.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Counterparty risk is also considered low. All of the Group’s surplus cash is held with highly-rated banks, in line with Group policy.</p>
<p class="box3b-title">Liquidity risk</p>
<p class="noindenta">Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Group operates with net current liabilities and is therefore reliant on the continued strong performance of the retail portfolio to meet its short-term liabilities. Short and medium-term cash forecasting is used to manage liquidity risk. These forecasts are used to ensure the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions.</p>
<p class="noindenta">During the year the Group accessed liquidity under the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (‘CCFF’) at a favourable rate of interest. The borrowings were repaid in December 2020 and the related costs have been charged to finance costs.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Group also arranged a £100 million syndicated revolving credit facility which matures in December 2023 with options to extend for up to two years. This facility was undrawn at 2 January 2021. For the first up to twelve months of the facility the covenants in place comprise: monthly net borrowings do not exceed £70 million; and liquidity is maintained above a minimum of £30 million. Thereafter the covenants comprise: leverage (calculated as the ratio of net borrowings to EBITDA) does not exceed 3:1; and fixed charge cover (calculated as the ratio of EBITDA to net rent and interest payable) cannot be below 1.75:1.</p>
<p class="box3b-title">Market risk</p>
<p class="noindenta">Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Market risk is not significant and therefore sensitivity analysis would not be meaningful.</p>
<p class="box3b-title">Currency risk</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Group has no regular material transactions in foreign currency although there are occasional purchases, mainly of capital items, denominated in foreign currency. Whilst certain costs such as electricity and wheat can be influenced by movements in the US dollar, actual contracts are priced in sterling. In respect of those key costs which are volatile, such as electricity and flour, the price may be fixed for a period of time in line with Group policy. All such contracts are for the Group’s own expected usage.</p>
<p class="box3b-title">Interest rate risk</p>
<p class="noindenta">Interest rate risk is the risk that movement in the interbank offered rates increase causing finance costs to increase. The Group’s interest rate risk arises from its revolving credit facility. Whilst the facility remains undrawn increases in the interest rate will not impact on finance costs.</p>
<p class="box3b-title">Equity price risk</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Group has no significant equity investments other than its subsidiaries and associate. As disclosed in Note 21 the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme has investments in equity-related funds.</p>
<p class="box3b-title">Capital management</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Group’s capital management objectives are:</p>
<ul class="hyp">
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>To ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and<a id="page_461"></a></li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>To provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and delivering services commensurate with the level of risk.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindenta">To meet these objectives the Group reviews the budgets and forecasts on a regular basis to ensure there is sufficient capital to meet the needs of the Group through to profitability and positive cashflow.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. All working capital requirements are financed from existing cash resources and borrowings.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Board reserves the option to purchase its own shares in the market dependent on market prices and surplus cash levels. The trustees of the Greggs Employee Benefit Trust also purchase shares for future satisfaction of employee share options.</p>
<p class="box3b-title">Financial instruments</p>
<p class="box3ba-title">Group and Parent Company</p>
<p class="noindenta">All of the Group’s surplus cash is invested as cash placed on deposit or fixed-term deposits.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Group’s treasury policy has as its principal objective the achievement of the maximum rate of return on cash balances whilst maintaining an acceptable level of risk. Other than mentioned below there are no financial instruments, derivatives or commodity contracts used.</p>
<p class="box3ba-title">Financial assets and liabilities</p>
<p class="noindenta">A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="hyp">
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and</li>
<li class="hyp1">–<span class="pad1"></span>its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindenta">The Group’s main financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents and fixed-term deposits. Other financial assets include trade receivables arising from the Group’s activities. These financial assets all meet the conditions to be recognised at amortised cost.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Other than trade and other payables, the Group had no financial liabilities within the scope of IFRS 9 as at 2 January 2021 (2019: £nil).</p>
<p class="box3ba-title">Fair values</p>
<p class="noindenta">The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying values. Financial assets and liabilities comprise principally of trade receivables and trade payables and the only interest-bearing balances are the bank deposits and borrowings which attract interest at variable rates.</p>
<p class="box3ba-title">Interest rate, credit and foreign currency risk</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Group has not entered into any hedging transactions during the year and considers interest rate, credit and foreign currency risks not to be significant.</p>

<p class="noindenta">During 2018, the Company exchanged contracts for the disposal of the vacant Twickenham site. The disposal is conditional on a number of factors, including the applications for and successful grant of planning permission. As at the end of 2020 the timing of the resolution of these factors remains uncertain and therefore this asset continues to be classified as non-current. At this stage the total proceeds arising from supply chain site disposals are still expected to be in line with those anticipated in the investment plan.<a id="page_468"></a></p>

The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day-to-day administration of the benefits.</p>
<p class="noindenta">UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The last funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 6 April 2017 and showed a surplus. The Company is currently not required to pay contributions into the scheme.</p>
<p class="box3ba-title">Profile of the scheme</p>
<p class="noindenta">The defined benefit pension obligation includes benefits for former employees and current pensioners. Broadly, two-thirds of the liabilities are attributable to deferred members and one-third to current pensioners.</p>
<p class="noindenta">The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted average time until benefit payments are made. For the scheme as a whole, the duration is approximately 18 years.</p>
<p class="box3ba-title">Investment strategy</p>
<p class="noindenta">The Company and Trustees have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate. This includes a policy to hold sufficient cash and bond assets to cover the anticipated benefit payments for at least the next five years so as to improve the cashflow matching of the scheme’s assets and liabilities.</p>
