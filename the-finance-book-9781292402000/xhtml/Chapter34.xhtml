<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta">A <a id="gloss-11" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_11"><span class="italic">budget</span></a> is a financial and operational business plan. It is used to implement an organisation’s objectives by setting financial targets.</p>
<p class="noindenta">A <span class="italic">forecast</span> is an estimation of an organisation’s financial performance for specific periods in the future, for example the final quarter of the year.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Budgets are usually set annually in advance of a financial year, whereas forecasts are typically prepared more frequently and updated a number of times during a financial year.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Management accounts (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter31.xhtml">Chapter 31 Management accounts</a></span>) will usually include a report of actual performance compared to budget and a forecast of the predicted activity level and results. The budget is used to benchmark past performance, whereas the forecast is used to predict future performance.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">The format of the budget</h2>
<p class="noindent">The main budget (known as the master budget) follows the format of the primary financial statements. For example:</p>
<table class="table">

<col class="colwidth35"/>
<col class="colwidth35"/>
<col class="colwidth40"/>
</colgroup>

<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_353"></a>Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Budgets and forecasts are important for the following reasons:</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Planning</h2>
<p class="noindent">Even though actual results are often different from budgets and forecasts, the process of planning is an important business discipline. Successful businesses set themselves clear objectives during strategic planning. Setting and managing budgets and forecasts is helpful in trying to meet those objectives.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Identification and utilisation of scarce resources</h2>
<p class="noindent">The process of budgeting helps to identify scarce resources and other constraints that need to be carefully managed. For example, companies do not have unlimited cash reserves. The budget process will help allocate cash to those departments which can generate the most value.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Communication and coordination</h2>
<p class="noindent">All the areas of an organisation must fit and work together to drive the business in the right direction.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_354"></a>A budget gives a sense of the big picture. It is an effective way to communicate objectives to every area of a business and to make sure that everyone works towards the same goal.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Organisational control</h2>
<p class="noindent">Budgets provide a basis for authorising expenditure and delegating financial responsibility to ‘budget holders’. Budget holders can be classified by their responsibility, for example:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col class="colwidth40"/>
<col class="colwidth20"/>
<col class="colwidth20"/>
<col class="colwidth20"/>
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="thleft">Cost centres</th>
<th class="thleft">Revenue centres</th>
<th class="thleft">Profit centres</th>
<th class="thleft">Investment centres</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tdleft">Responsible for managing and controlling costs. Most budget holders in practice will be cost centres.</td>
<td class="tdleft">Responsible for managing sales revenue, for example, a sales team.</td>
<td class="tdleft">Responsible for both sales and managing costs, for example, a retail outlet.</td>
<td class="tdleft">Responsible for managing profits as well as some balance sheet items, such as capital expenditure, credit customers and suppliers.<br/>For example, regional offices of multinationals.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="noindent">Budget holders can be motivated by being set realistic yet challenging targets. However, if the budget is too challenging this can sometimes have the reverse effect.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Performance measurement and evaluation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Budgets are a useful benchmark against which to measure and evaluate performance. Monitoring actual performance against budget is also an effective method of organisational control. It helps to ensure that income, expenditure and cash flows are managed and is good corporate governance (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter22.xhtml">Chapter 22 Corporate governance and whistleblowing</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Management can take corrective action against underperformance against budget (‘negative variances’) to steer the organisation back <a id="page_355"></a>on track. Alternatively, performance improvements (‘positive variances’) can be encouraged, where desirable.</p>
<p class="noindent">In practice most businesses will use the principle of ‘management by exception’, concentrating on variances above a certain percentage or amount.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Advance warning</h2>
<p class="noindent">Regular forecasting can help spot problems before they happen. Budgets rarely match reality and forecasts are needed to navigate unpredictable environments and steer the business back on course before it is too late. Cash flow forecasting, in particular, is critical as businesses may need to take short-term action to manage their cash position.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Budgeting and forecasting challenges</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Time and money</h2>
<p class="noindent">The budget-setting process can take several months in some organisations and involves many finance and non-finance personnel. The budget-setting and monitoring process often results in a large cost for a business.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2021, APQC collected data on budgeting from more than 3,900 organisations and found that the bottom quartile of organisations took twice as long to complete their annual budget as the top quartile.<sup><a href="Chapter34.xhtml#fn1" id="rfn1">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 class="h2a">Out of date</h2>
<p class="noindent">Ironically, despite budgets taking a long time to create, they are often out of date a few months into the new financial year as events unfold. Budgeting is usually an annual event and budget cycles do not always coincide with cycles in the business environment.</p>
<h2 class="h2a"><a id="page_356"></a>A constraint</h2>
<p class="noindent">In some organisations the budget can act as a constraint, in that once it is set, management does not allow any movement away from the budget. Some argue that this restricts creativity and means that businesses miss out on opportunities which were not foreseen when the budget was set. In addition, it is argued that an undue emphasis on the budget results in an overly internal focus.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Budgetary slack and padding</h2>
<p class="noindent">Budgets are a great measure of performance. However, if they are used by management as a target then (what is known as) Goodhart’s law can become an issue. ‘When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure’.</p>
<p class="noindent">Budget holders may be motivated to underestimate revenue and overestimate costs when setting budgets, to ensure they exceed their budget and receive a positive evaluation. This motivation may be enhanced when rewards such as bonuses are received for meeting or exceeding budgets.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a significant percentage of budget holders attempt to pad their budgets, it will lead to inaccurate planning and potentially wasted resources.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a further issue, it is likely that budget holders with built in contingency will spend close to their full allocation, due to the old adage ‘if you don’t use it, you lose it’. This is often evidenced by a surge of spending close to the accounting year end.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">In most organisations the budget-setting process takes place annually, several months before the year end. The process is usually a combination of ‘top-down’ guidance from senior management with ‘bottom-up’ input involving budget holders from every area of the business and centrally coordinated by the finance department.</p>
<p class="noindent">During the financial year budget holders will receive regular reports, usually monthly, of their progress against their budget.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_357"></a>Forecasting on the other hand is more of a ‘top-down’ process undertaken by the finance department with input from selected budget holders. Forecasts usually take place either monthly or quarterly. This is illustrated in the diagram below.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">Alternative methods of budgeting</h2>
<h2 class="h2b">Incremental</h2>
<p class="noindent">An <a id="gloss-66" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_66"><span class="italic">incremental</span></a> approach is where <span class="italic">budgets</span> are based on the previous year’s budget plus or minus a set percentage.</p>
<p class="noindent">The advantage of this approach is that it is quick and involves less effort. It is the most common form of budgeting in organisations. The drawback is that any inefficiencies, padding or slack are carried forward.</p>
<h2 class="h2b"><a id="page_358"></a>Zero-based</h2>
<p class="noindent">The opposite of incremental budgeting is <a id="gloss-125" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_125"><span class="italic">zero-based budgeting</span></a>. This approach calculates the budget from a ‘zero base’, i.e. starting from scratch.</p>
<p class="noindent">The advantage is that any inherited efficiencies can be eliminated and the budget is more accurate. The drawback is the time, resources and hence cost required to set the budget in this way.</p>
<p class="noindent">In practice, an effective compromise is to zero base the budget every few years or alternatively to zero base different parts of the budget on a rotational basis each year, with the drawback that this can lead to inconsistency across the organisation.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Rolling</h2>
<p class="noindent">An alternative to a ‘fixed’ (or ‘periodic’) budget is a <a id="gloss-107" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_107"><span class="italic">rolling</span></a> (or ‘continuous’) <span class="italic">budget</span>, which re-budgets on a regular basis, usually monthly or quarterly. Each period the budget is updated, i.e. ‘rolled forward’. For example, see the illustration below.</p>

<aside class="ph-side">
<figure class="image-c">
<img id="myImg_2" class="get_images_id" src="../images/Fig-24.jpg" aria-details="altch1fig25" alt="A diagram illustrating the rolling budget from the year 2021 to 2022." width="615" height="270"/>

</aside>

<p class="noindent">The advantage is that new information is incorporated as events unfold and the budget is more up to date. Additionally, as budget holders are aware that the budget will be updated, they may be less likely to build in ‘contingencies for unplanned events’. The drawback is the time required each period to update the budget. However, supporters of rolling budgets argue that as budgeting takes place more regularly the time is simply spread over the year and doesn’t require as much ‘up front’ time.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_359"></a>Cisco Systems, Electrolux and General Electric are examples of companies who use rolling budgets in practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">Rolling budgets are most effective when the budget period is continually extended for at least 12 months ahead as this reduces the ‘shrinking visibility’ problem of most fixed annual budgets (when budgets and forecasts do not extend beyond the financial year end). For fixed budgets, as the year end approaches the future time horizon ‘shrinks’ and organisations have less visibility of what lies ahead.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some organisations opt for a compromise and use annual budgets together with rolling re-forecasts, continually extended at least 12 months ahead.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Optional detail <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Optional.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">The use of spreadsheets for budgeting</h2>
<p class="noindent">Many accounting systems have budgeting capability – however, in practice spreadsheets remain a well-used and popular budgeting tool.</p>
<p class="noindent">Microsoft has previously reported that 40% of SMEs use Excel to prepare their accounts, forecasting and budgeting.</p>
<p class="noindent">While spreadsheets are invaluable and flexible tools, it is important to be aware of their risks when budgeting and forecasting.</p>
<p class="noindent">Professor Ray Panko of the University of Hawaii is one of the world’s leading experts on spreadsheet errors. In association with EuSpRIG (European Spreadsheet Risks Interest Group) Professor Panko notes that his research has found ‘ample evidence demonstrating that spreadsheet errors are common and nontrivial.’<sup><a href="Chapter34.xhtml#fn2" id="rfn2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in 2020, nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases went unreported in England due to a spreadsheet error by Public Health England.<sup><a href="Chapter34.xhtml#fn3" id="rfn3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_360"></a>Also, in 2020 a report published by Grant Thornton revealed that a copy-and-paste error in a spreadsheet started a chain of events which ultimately delayed the opening of the new £150 million hospital in Edinburgh.<sup><a href="Chapter34.xhtml#fn4" id="rfn4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent">In practice, most spreadsheet errors are caused by simple mistakes such as including too many or too few figures in totals or adding figures that ought to be subtracted. The importance of error checking cannot be underestimated.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Beyond budgeting</h2>
<p class="noindent">Operating since 1998, the Beyond Budgeting Round Table (BBRT), an independent research collaborative, has proposed that budgeting, as it is currently practised by most organisations (a traditional command and control management model), should be abandoned.</p>
<p class="noindent">Beyond Budgeting principles of ‘empowerment’ and ‘being adaptive’ have attracted organisations from all over the world, including American Express, Google, Handelsbanken, John Lewis Partnership, Southwest Airlines and Toyota.</p>
<p class="noindent">BBRT assert that their principles help organisations to ‘break free from the shackles of budgeting and its culture of gaming and misinformation’. They suggest that planning is undertaken on a continuous, participative basis and only high-level forecasts are needed.</p>
<p class="noindent">BBRT suggest that performance evaluation should be based on relative performance indicators which take account of the conditions, including long-term external benchmarks, under which the business is operating.<sup><a href="Chapter34.xhtml#fn5" id="rfn5">5</a></sup></p>
