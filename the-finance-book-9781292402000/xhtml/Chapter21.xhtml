<p class="box-ext"><span class="bold">‘It is much more convenient not to be a public company. As a private company you don’t have to give information to the public. . . ’</span></p>
<p class="box-aut">Marc Rich, Glencore plc</p>
</div>
<div class="box2">
<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta">Unlike sole traders and partners in partnerships, companies have <span class="italic">limited liability</span>. This means that the owners can only lose the money they put into the business, and nothing more.</p>
<p class="noindenta">In return for the benefits of limited liability, companies must provide information about their activities, including details about directors and shareholdings. This information is held in the public domain and is available to view for free online at Companies House.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Every company must file a <a id="gloss-18" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_18"><span class="italic">Confirmation Statement</span></a> at Companies House. This annual requirement confirms the information filed and publicly available is correct and up to date.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Companies must also file financial statements (‘accounts’) annually, although only the largest have to make extensive financial disclosures about their affairs.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Directors are legally responsible for submitting information to Companies House within statutory published filing deadlines.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">All companies must prepare annual financial statements, known also as ‘statutory accounts’, for both shareholders and tax authorities (HMRC in the UK).</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_208"></a>The nature and extent of financial information disclosed depends on the size of the company (see <span class="bold">Optional detail</span> section below). In general terms, the bigger the company, the more disclosure required.</p>
<p class="noindent">PLCs (public limited companies), such as those listed on the Stock Exchange as well as large private companies, are required to file <span class="italic">full</span> statutory accounts. Full accounts comprise:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>profit and loss account (income statement)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>balance sheet (statement of financial position)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>extensive notes (providing detail to the numbers disclosed in the above statements).</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In addition, a company must publish a directors' report. This will list the names of everyone who, at any time during the financial year, held the office of director.</p>
<p class="noindent">In smaller companies, there is no requirement to <span class="italic">publicly</span> file the profit and loss account or directors’ report. Small companies can reduce disclosure further by filing a simplified set of accounts, known as <a id="gloss-1" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_1"><span class="italic">abridged</span></a> accounts. Abridged accounts provide very limited financial information about the performance (success) of the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">All accounts, whether for a large or small company, full or abridged, must comply with relevant accounting standards and Companies Act requirements (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter19.xhtml">Chapter 19 Accounting and financial reporting standards</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter20.xhtml">Chapter 20 External financial audit)</a></span>.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Why and when is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Wh-1.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="36"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2b">Financial accounts</h2>
<p class="noindent">The preparation of accounts is a legal responsibility placed on directors. Directors must prepare (or assume responsibility for preparing) financial statements and for filing the accounts within the statutory deadlines set for the company. The deadlines differ for public and private companies:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="bold"><a id="page_209"></a>Public limited companies:</span> Accounts must be filed within 6 months* after the company’s year end (known as the accounting reference date).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="bold">Private limited companies:</span> Accounts must be filed within 9 months* after the accounting reference date.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">(*Time periods may in exceptional circumstances be extended, as was the case during the Covid-19 pandemic.)</p>

<p class="alt-noindent">For a public limited company (plc), the year-end is 31 march and the filing deadline is 30 September (6 months) while for the private limited company (ltd) year-end is 31 march and the filing deadline is 31 December (9 months).</p>

<p class="noindent">Companies House will impose fines for late filing and may take steps to strike off a company from the public record where the accounts are delivered late.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">Director information</h2>
<p class="noindent">Companies must provide to Companies House details of directors such as the residential address of each director. This information will be placed on public record only if the residential address is used as the company’s registered office or director’s service address.</p>
<p class="noindent">Companies House places no restrictions on how publicly filed information can be used. Directors who therefore use their home address as their registered office may receive unsolicited mail (or visits from creditors!). Mortgage or insurance agreements may prevent or restrict the use of a home address for business purposes and lenders or insurers may routinely scrutinise publicly available information to confirm there has been no breach.</p>
<h2 class="h2b"><a id="page_210"></a>The confirmation statement</h2>
<p class="noindent">The confirmation statement is an annual filing requirement for every company, including dormant companies. The confirmation statement confirms that information about the company provided to Companies House and displayed on the public register is accurate and up to date. The information disclosed includes registered address, principal activities, share capital, shareholder name(s) and shareholdings.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no financial penalty for filing the confirmation statement after the deadline; however, Companies House could start legal action against the company directors and will eventually remove the company from the register if it fails to provide the required information.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Nice to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Idea.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Filed information remains on public record, i.e. in the public domain <span class="italic">indefinitely</span>, while the company is active.  To improve corporate transparency, the records for companies dissolved (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter25.xhtml">Chapter 25 Insolvency and going concern risk</a></span>) since 2010 are also now kept on public record and accessible online.</p>
<p class="noindent">Any and all filings made by a company can be found by searching the company (by name) at the Companies House (gov.uk) website and searching under <span class="italic">filing history</span>. As well as Companies House, listed companies will have an ‘investor relations’ section on their own corporate websites which includes financial information, such as annual reports.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Directors’ remuneration</h2>
<p class="noindent">Directors’ remuneration (salary, bonus, long term incentives, pensions, perks) is an area of focus and interest, in particular for listed companies.</p>
<p class="noindent">Disclosures depend on the size and nature of the company:</p>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Small unquoted companies <span class="italic">do not</span> have to disclose director remuneration unless they have not been concluded under <a id="page_211"></a>‘normal market conditions’ (while this term is not defined in legislation, it can be approximated by benchmarking to what an externally recruited director would have to be paid to perform a similar role). </li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>For larger unquoted companies, limited disclosures <span class="italic">are</span> required if the total of all remuneration paid to directors exceeds £200,000. In this instance, a breakdown of payments made to the highest paid director only must be disclosed in the filed accounts (note: the identity of the highest paid director does not have to be disclosed).</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Listed companies (PLCs with a stock market listing) must disclose the remuneration paid to each director separately as required by Stock Exchange Listing Rules. The figure must show the total remuneration paid to each director howsoever it has been ‘paid’ (i.e. whether salary, bonus, long-term incentive or pension).</li>
