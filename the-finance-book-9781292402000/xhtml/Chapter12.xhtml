<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindentai">Credit is one of the cornerstones of modern business. The majority of companies offer and receive credit.</p>
<p class="noindentai">Customers who receive credit are known as debtors (or receivables). Suppliers who offer credit are known as creditors (or payables).</p>
<p class="noindentai">Debtors are assets as they will be a future cash inflow or ‘benefit’. Creditors are liabilities as they will be a future cash outflow or cost.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h2">Need to know <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Need.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Why is this important? <img style="float:right; vertical-align:middle;" src="../images/Why.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Debtors are an important source of future cash inflows. They enable a business to predict with some degree of certainty the cash that will be received in the following days and weeks.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, debtors are not yet cash and cannot be used to fund immediate cash demands faced by a business.</p>
<p class="noindent">Creditors, on the other hand, may be an important source of short-term business finance. Paying suppliers later, rather than earlier, means that cash is available within the business for longer. If the period of credit offered by suppliers correlates to the period of credit <a id="page_121"></a>offered to customers, it will help an organisation manage its cash flow. </p>
<p class="noindent">Debtors and creditors form part of a business’s working capital. The other main component of working capital is stock (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11 Stock</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">When is this important? <img style="float:right;" src="../images/When.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">The management of debtors and creditors is a continuous task for the majority of businesses. Managing the timing of cash inflows and cash outflows is essential for a business to survive. It is important to monitor regularly and sometimes remind debtors that their payment is due (see <a id="gloss-24" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_24"><span class="bold">Credit control</span></a> below).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">In practice <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Tool.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="41"/></h2>
<p class="noindent">Businesses invest sizable resources, particularly into managing debtors. Examples of typical management tools are:</p>

The problem can be analysed to see if it is an issue across many debtors or caused by a few debtors who have distorted the average.</li></ul></td>

<h2 class="h2a">Managing debtors</h2>
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="bold">Debt factoring</span></li>
<li class="boxi">This is where a business outsources the collection of debt to a third party, who has specific expertise in managing and collecting debts. <a id="gloss-31" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_31"><span class="italic">Debt factoring</span></a> has some advantages (for example, freeing staff to concentrate on running the business, strong credit control procedures and cash advances (at a discount) issued by some factoring companies). It does also have some consequential disadvantages (for example loss of contact with customers and reliance on the factoring company). (See also <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management</a></span>.)</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="bold">Invoice factoring</span></li>
<li class="boxi">Useful for cash advances on specific high-value invoices, as opposed to debt factoring all customer debts.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="bold">Insurance</span></li>
<li class="boxi">For a premium it is possible to insure against certain risky debts. This is useful for exporters.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="bold">Sale of debts</span></li>
<li class="boxi">There are specialist debt collection companies who will purchase debtor balances and even bad debts (see below) from organisations. However, they will only pay a proportion of the amount the debtors owe for such debts.</li>
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span><span class="bold">Offering discounts</span></li>
<li class="boxi">Some businesses offer discounts to incentivise early payment. The cost/benefit of discounts should be carefully considered. Often the cost of a discount can be more expensive than the cost of finance relating to the delay in receiving monies from customers. Additionally, some customers will take the discount despite not paying early.<a id="page_124"></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2a">Bad debts</h2>
<p class="noindent">Bad debts are a fact of life for many businesses. Many companies will have a bad debt provision (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter14.xhtml">Chapter 14 Provisions and contingencies</a></span>) in their accounts made up of two elements:</p>
<ul class="num">
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">1</span><span class="pad1"></span>A specific bad debt provision:
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>This is for specific known debtors. For example, those which have become insolvent or where there is a potentially unresolvable dispute.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="num"><span class="ash1">2</span><span class="pad1"></span>A general bad debt provision:
<ul class="box">
<li class="box"><span class="ash">■</span><span class="pad1"></span>Through experience the business typically suffers a number of unanticipated bad debts for a variety of reasons. A general bad debt provision is set, typically as a percentage of the overall debtors’ balance to reflect this, for example 2%.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
<p class="noindent">Debtors are quoted net of bad debt provisions in a company’s balance sheet.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">Managing suppliers</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is also important to manage supplier payments.</p>
<p class="noindent">Suppliers are not only an important source of credit; they are also essential to the success of a business as they often provide the key inputs. While it is acceptable to ask for credit from suppliers, it is important not to abuse their goodwill. Healthy supplier relationships are important to ensure continued future supply.</p>
<p class="noindent">Accounting systems will produce aged supplier listings which enable payments to be planned and scheduled (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2 Finance personnel and systems</a></span>). This should be integrated into a cash flow forecast to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet payment deadlines. Most businesses will take full advantage of the credit offered by suppliers (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is often a question of relative ‘power’, which dictates who determines payment terms, which is why many businesses prefer to do business with similar-sized partners.<a id="page_125"></a></p>
<h2 class="h2">Optional detail <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Optional.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Debtor and creditor days</h2>
<p class="noindent">Debtor and creditor days can be calculated by using the following formulas:</p>
<p class="mathi"><math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="">
 <mrow>
  <mtext>Debtor collection period</mtext><mo>=</mo><mfrac>

   <mrow>

<p class="noindent">* ideally only credit sales should be used as the denominator.</p>

</math></p>
<p class="noindent">** ideally only credit purchases should be used as the denominator.</p>
<p class="noindent">(See <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter24.xhtml">Chapter 24 Working capital and liquidity management</a></span>).</p>
<h2 class="h2a">The debit and credit confusion</h2>
<p class="noindent">The terms ‘debtors’ and ‘creditors’ are derived from the terms ‘debits’ and ‘credits’. For a business, debtors are debits and creditors are credits. Debits and credits are part of the system of double entry bookkeeping underpinning accounting.</p>
<p class="noindent">Confusion sometimes arises because retail banks use the terms debit and credit from their own perspective (as opposed to their customers’ perspective). The prevalence of these terms used by banks has confused their meaning for many people their meaning for many people.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, consider how bank balances are seen by both businesses and banks:</p>
<table class="table">
