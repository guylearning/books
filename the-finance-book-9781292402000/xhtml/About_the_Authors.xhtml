<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Stuart Warner Bsc (Hons) FCA, BFP, Cert IoD</span> is the author of four finance books, delivers training and consultancy internationally across multiple sectors and holds several non-executive positions. His goal is to help businesses increase productivity and profits through innovative, engaging and experiential finance training programmes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Over his career, Stuart has trained thousands of people. He has taught accounting trainees for professional qualifications; delivered CPD courses for qualified accountants and interactive courses for non-finance professionals from graduate to board level. Stuart studied management sciences at UMIST and became a Chartered Accountant whilst working at PwC.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Stuart loves the fresh air and peace of the countryside, especially the scenic hills of North Wales, so he decided to live in London for ample doses of air pollution, loud noises and views of tall concrete buildings. In his spare time he can be found trying his best to keep up in exercise classes, falling off his mountain bike or falling off walls whilst indoor rock climbing.</p>
