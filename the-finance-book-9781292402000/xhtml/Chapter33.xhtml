<p class="box2-title">In a nutshell</p>
<p class="noindenta">‘Profit planning’ is an important business discipline. It impacts pricing (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter32.xhtml">Chapter 32 Profitable pricing</a></span>), budgeting (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter34.xhtml">Chapter 34 Budgeting and forecasting</a></span>) and investment appraisal (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter35.xhtml">Chapter 35 Investment appraisal</a></span>)<span class="bold">.</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Essentially it is a method of calculating forecast profits for different products and services.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Profit planning requires an understanding of variable and fixed costs as well as the concept of ‘contribution’.</p>
<p class="noindenta">By using simple ratios businesses can calculate target profits and their sensitivity to the break-even sales revenue.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">1 Cost classification</h2>
<p class="noindent">The first step in profit planning is to classify operating costs into ‘variable’ and ‘fixed’ categories.</p>

<p class="noindent">On first read, one may suggest that XYZ Ltd should stop selling product Y as it is showing a loss of £50,000 and instead focus solely on product X which makes a profit of £300,000.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_343"></a>The challenge is that in many businesses fixed costs are often centrally allocated on an arbitrary basis to departments (such as product Y).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the total fixed costs of £400,000 relate to costs of running a warehouse, which has been allocated to each product equally, the costs would be unavoidable (i.e. they would still exist with or without product Y). Discontinuing product Y will mean that product X alone must absorb all the fixed costs of £400,000. This would in effect reduce product X’s overall profit from £250,000 to £100,000 as follows:</p>

<p class="noindent">This analysis shows that despite initially appearing to make a loss after allocated fixed costs, product Y still makes a positive contribution of £150,000 towards fixed costs and profit. Therefore, <a id="page_344"></a>product Y should not be discontinued. This assumes that the fixed costs of £400,000 would still exist with or without product Y.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_350"></a>A 25% change in revenue leads to a 30% change in operating profit for company A and a 45% change for company B.</p>
<p class="noindent">As company B has a higher percentage of fixed costs, its operating profits are more volatile.</p>
<h2 class="h2b">A rise in sales revenue</h2>
<p class="noindent">The same magnification would apply if revenue increased. Company B would experience a higher percentage growth in profits than company A.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although company B has a higher operating risk than company A, it has a higher ‘contribution margin’ and therefore has more flexibility with pricing (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter32.xhtml">Chapter 32 Profitable pricing</a></span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Company A versus company B is an example of the trade off between risk and return.</p>
<h2 class="h2">Optional detail <img style="float:right;" src="../images/Optional.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40"/></h2>
<h2 class="h2a">Mixed costs</h2>
<p class="noindent">Some costs are also ‘mixed’ in that they include an element of both fixed and variable costs. For example, a phone bill typically consists of a fixed rental charge plus a variable charge for calls made. To calculate ‘contribution’ <a id="gloss-81" href="Glossary.xhtml#gloss_81"><span class="italic">mixed costs</span></a> will need to be split into their fixed and variable parts.</p>
<h2 class="h2a">CVP analysis</h2>
<p class="noindent">Accountants sometimes refer to profit planning with calculations of contribution as <span class="italic">CVP (cost–volume–profit) analysis.</span></p>
<h2 class="h2a">Contribution per unit</h2>
<p class="noindent">This chapter has looked at total contribution. CVP analysis can also be undertaken on a unit basis, looking at sales price per unit, variable cost per unit and therefore contribution per unit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although more complicated, this has the added benefit of being able to calculate a break-even sales quantity (units sold) in addition to the break-even sales revenue demonstrated in this chapter.</p>

<p class="noindent">Profit planning is an internal process and therefore does not feature in company accounts.</p>
<p class="noindent">Within the narrative of annual reports there may be references to terms such as ‘margins’, ‘contribution’, ‘break even’, ’operating risk’ and ‘cost analysis’, which can indicate the existence of ‘profit planning’ in some format.</p>
