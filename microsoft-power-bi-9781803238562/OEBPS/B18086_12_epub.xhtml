			<h1 id="_idParaDest-234"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"></a>Chapter 12</em>: Exposing Insights from Data</h1>
			<p>To get the most value out of your Power BI reports and dashboards, you'll want to make sure they answer the questions that are most valuable to your organization. Sometimes, that means you need to reduce the data that you're looking at, to best focus on specific elements of a dataset and best understand how those elements relate to others. Usually, this means that we're analyzing subsets of data or sets of records. For example, maybe our entire dataset includes sales from across the United States, but we want to understand the volume of sales for each state or only within one state. By doing this, we'll be able to draw insights from the data that are harder to find otherwise.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we'll look at the ways insights can be exposed from data in Power BI reports and dashboards. We will cover the following topics: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exploring slicers and filters</li>
				<li>The Analytics pane</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"></a>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>You will need the following tools for this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed on a Microsoft Windows PC.</li>
				<li>A Power BI data model where we can apply the advanced features covered in this chapter.</li>
				<li>Examples in the text will use the Power BI data model and reports that you've created in previous chapters, but these are not required.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"></a>Exploring slicers and filters</h1>
			<p>Slicers allow Power BI users to apply filters dynamically to data shown in visuals. This is helpful when <a id="_idIndexMarker672"></a>you have an entire dataset that can be divided or segmented to show different characteristics of the data. For example, our sales database <a id="_idIndexMarker673"></a>contains both store sales and customer addresses and the associated relationship between the two. This means we can use the map and table visuals to see how many sales we have in each state of the United States, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.1</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer185" class="IMG---Figure">

" width="821" height="427"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.1 – Map and table of net store sales</p>
			<p>As we increase our understanding of this data, we will want to be able to better understand how the net store sales compare for each state. Some states seem to be very close in net store sales. To help us, we're going to use the slicer visual and add the <strong class="source-inline">ca_state</strong> column to the slicer visual. This means we can select just the states <strong class="bold">Iowa</strong> and <strong class="bold">Missouri</strong>. The table and map visuals will filter to only those states.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer186" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_12_2.jpg" alt="Figure 12.2 – Only Iowa and Missouri are selected with the slicer visual
" width="777" height="346"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.2 – Only Iowa and Missouri are selected with the slicer visual</p>
			<p>By using the slicer, we filter the dataset to only contain records from the states <strong class="bold">Iowa</strong> and <strong class="bold">Missouri</strong>. When this filter has been applied, the map visual only highlights the two states and <a id="_idIndexMarker674"></a>adjusts the colors accordingly. Now we can easily see that <strong class="bold">Missouri</strong> has higher <a id="_idIndexMarker675"></a>net store sales than <strong class="bold">Iowa</strong>. We can also see the table being filtered to only show net store sales for the states of <strong class="bold">Missouri</strong> and <strong class="bold">Iowa</strong>.</p>
			<p>Slicers have unique capabilities depending on the type of data being used to filter. For example, if filtering on numeric values such as net store sales, you'll be presented with a range slider that allows you to adjust a numeric range, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.3</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer187" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_12_3.jpg" alt="Figure 12.3 – Numeric slicer
" width="466" height="83"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.3 – Numeric slicer</p>
			<p>By default, when a date field is added to a slicer, you will see a similar date range slider. However, since a date field was used, you can change the options on the slicer to filter data using <strong class="bold">Between</strong>, <strong class="bold">Before</strong>, <strong class="bold">After</strong>, <strong class="bold">List</strong>, <strong class="bold">Dropdown</strong>, <strong class="bold">Relative Date</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Relative Time</strong> operators. Each setting will be useful depending on the scenario. Relative date and relative time are useful for filtering based on the current date. For example, you can filter records for the last year, next year, or this year. You can set the numeric value and the time period (day, week, month, year), so it's also possible to use this relative date slicer to filter showing records for the last 6 months.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer188" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_12_4.jpg" alt="Figure 12.4 – Options for date slicers
" width="673" height="568"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.4 – Options for date slicers</p>
			<p>Slicers can also be set to select a relative time if the column includes a time value. This will allow you to filter records by a relative time in the same way relative date works.</p>
			<p>For slicers <a id="_idIndexMarker676"></a>that show a selection list of values, it is also possible to make them <a id="_idIndexMarker677"></a>responsive to the size of the visual on the report page. To do this, simply change to a horizontal orientation, as well as enabling the responsive option under the <strong class="bold">General</strong> heading on the format for visual. This means that instead of a vertical list of values, you have a horizontal list of buttons that can be selected. In horizontal and responsive configurations, the list of values changes the shape and positioning to best fit the size of the visual. Example positioning based on different sizes can be seen in <em class="italic">Figure 12.5</em> and <em class="italic">Figure 12.6</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer189" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_12_5.jpg" alt="Figure 12.5 – Slicer with text values in vertical orientation
" width="169" height="500"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.5 – Slicer with text values in vertical orientation</p>
			<p>The same <a id="_idIndexMarker678"></a>set of values in the slicer but shown in horizontal orientation <a id="_idIndexMarker679"></a>will look something like <em class="italic">Figure 12.6</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer190" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_12_6.jpg" alt="Figure 12.6 – Slicer with text values in horizontal orientation
" width="359" height="329"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.6 – Slicer with text values in horizontal orientation</p>
			<p>Lastly, when a field with a <strong class="bold">hierarchy</strong> is added to a slicer, it becomes possible to filter the data based on the hierarchical values of the column. For example, if you add a date hierarchy field to a slicer, then you will first filter on year, then quarter, then month, and finally, day.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer191" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_12_7.jpg" alt="Figure 12.7 – Slicer configured with a hierarchical date field
" width="303" height="336"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.7 – Slicer configured with a hierarchical date field</p>
			<p>Filtering data <a id="_idIndexMarker680"></a>with slicers is a great way of making reports interactive, and additionally, it's possible to change how the slicers interact with each visual on the <a id="_idIndexMarker681"></a>report page. With a slicer value selected, click <strong class="bold">Edit interactions</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Format</strong> tab on the Power BI Desktop ribbon to change into edit interactions mode, where each visual (except the one selected) now shows a selector to either filter the data or do nothing. Most visuals by default will have the interaction option set to <strong class="bold">filter</strong>. If you have a visual on the report page that you do not want to filter with the slicer, then you would need to ensure this option is set to <strong class="bold">None</strong>. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer192" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_12_8.jpg" alt="Figure 12.8 – Edit interactions
" width="112" height="48"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.8 – Edit interactions</p>
			<p>We've seen that a slicer is a visual that can be added to a report that filters other visuals. Additionally, both Power BI Desktop and the report view on Power BI online include a filtering pane. The filtering pane allows you to specify a data filter without having to use a visual. The <strong class="bold">Filtering</strong> pane is one of the primary three panes of the main Power BI Desktop window, along with <strong class="bold">Visualizations</strong> and <strong class="bold">Fields</strong>.</p>
			<p>Whe<a id="_idTextAnchor245"></a>n the filtering pane is opened and nothing in the canvas is selected, you will see options to configure the scope of the filtering to be applied: filters on this page and filtering on all pages. When a visual has been selected, another option becomes available – filters on this visual. Filters work much the same as slicers here; you just need to drag the field you'd like to filter by into the proper location on the filtering pane to select a scope. For example, you might filter all pages in the entire report (PBIX file) by a desired <a id="_idIndexMarker682"></a>fiscal year, while the filters on this page will only look at customers who own single-family homes, and within that page, you would have a filter on this <a id="_idIndexMarker683"></a>visual set to only show records when that customer had a birthday in December. This kind of filtering allows you to be very granular for the data shown in your reports.</p>

				<div id="_idContainer193" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p>Power BI provides a wide range of options for filtering data and providing interaction between visuals. </p>
			<p>Now, let's look at how we can use the Analytics pane to gain even more insights from our data.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"></a>The Analytics pane</h1>
			<p>Power BI Desktop includes the ability to add lines to a visual using the<strong class="bold"> Analytics </strong>pane. Lines are <a id="_idIndexMarker684"></a>useful to make it easier to see things such as trends, average, min, max, and other <a id="_idIndexMarker685"></a>functions used in <strong class="bold">statistical analysis</strong>.</p>
			<p>The type of lines that can be added depends on the visual used. Constant, trend, min, max, average, median, and percentile lines can be added to area, clustered bar, clustered column, line, and scatter chart visuals. <em class="italic">X</em>- and <em class="italic">y</em>-axis constant and symmetry shading can be added to scatter charts.</p>
			<p>To add these lines to a visual, select the visual and then click the magnifying glass icon (<em class="italic">Figure 12.10</em>) to activate the Analytics pane portion of the Visualizations pane.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer194" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_12_10.jpg" alt="Figure 12.10 – Magnifying glass icon to activate the Analytics pane
" width="61" height="74"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.10 – Magnifying glass icon to activate the Analytics pane</p>
			<p>In the Analytics pane, you can select which line you would like to add and select the options associated with each, such as the color, transparency, style, and configuration for combining the data series or highlighted values when the line gets rendered by Power BI.</p>
			<p>These analytics lines allow you to provide greater emphasis on things such as trends, min, or max while using visuals. For example, you might start with a visual as in <em class="italic">Figure 12.11</em> showing the count of sales by date:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer195" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_12_11.jpg" alt="Figure 12.11 – Clustered column chart showing the count of sales for each day in the year 2000
" width="1486" height="1097"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.11 – Clustered column chart showing the count of sales for each day in the year 2000</p>
			<p>To better emphasize <a id="_idIndexMarker686"></a>how the count of sales has increased in the second half of the calendar year, we might add a trend line to this visual and we'll see the overall upward trend of the count of sales from <strong class="source-inline">January 1, 2000</strong>, through <strong class="source-inline">December 31, 2000</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.12</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer196" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_12_12.jpg" alt="Figure 12.12 – Clustered column chart with a trend line showing the count of sales for each day in the year 2000
" width="773" height="565"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.12 – Clustered column chart with a trend line showing the count of sales for each day in the year 2000</p>
			<p>The great thing is that these lines are dynamic based on the data presented in the visual. So, if we have <a id="_idIndexMarker687"></a>a slicer that allows us to focus in on the first half of the year, we'll see that the trend in the first part of the year (<strong class="source-inline">January 1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">June 30</strong>) was going down slightly, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.13</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer197" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_12_13.jpg" alt="Figure 12.13 – Clustered column chart with a trend line showing the count of sales for each day from January 1 to June 30
" width="771" height="576"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.13 – Clustered column chart with a trend line showing the count of sales for each day from January 1 to June 30</p>
			<p>We can see that creating analytic lines on visuals adds additional user-friendliness that makes getting value from visuals even easier for data consumers.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned about the ways we can expose more insights from our data using tools such as slicers, filters, and the Analytics pane of Power BI. </p>
			<p>We learned how we can create <strong class="bold">interactive visuals</strong> for our users so they can filter data shown in report visuals in an intuitive way using slicers. We also learned how the built-in filters for reports provide a way of curating data for users by setting filters for all pages, the current page, or just specific visuals on a report.</p>
			<p>We learned how the Analytics pane provides a way to enhance some visuals to show statistical lines such as min, max, average, and trend lines. These lines are generated dynamically based on the data shown in the visual, so paired with slicers and filters, this allows for enhanced insight generation from existing Power BI reports.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we'll take a closer look at advanced analytics topics, such as time series analysis and binning.</p>
