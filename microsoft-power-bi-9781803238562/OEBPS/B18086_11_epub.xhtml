			<h1 id="_idParaDest-218"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"></a>Chapter 11</em>: Enhancing Reports</h1>
			<p>You already learned about the basic elements for creating a report in <a href="B18086_09_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor178"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Reports</em>. Now it's time to take the knowledge to the next level. After you've added your visuals, you can further enhance your report to allow you to tell your data-driven story the way you want to.</p>
			<p>Using Power BI Desktop, you'll learn how to transform your report to provide your report consumers with reports that are better organized, with a more effective layout and interactions. You'll be able to provide your users with tools that allow them to explore the data more effectively or allow you, as the report writer, to tell your data story in the order you want it told.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using bookmarks</li>
				<li>Designing reports for mobile devices</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"></a>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>For this chapter, please make sure you have the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed on a Microsoft Windows PC.</li>
				<li>We've also provided synthetic data that can be used, which is available in the GitHub repository for this book here: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Microsoft-Power-BI-Data-Analyst-Certification-Guide/tree/main/example-data">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Microsoft-Power-BI-Data-Analyst-Certification-Guide/tree/main/example-data</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"></a>Using bookmarks</h1>
			<p>Power BI installs with many visuals<a id="_idIndexMarker624"></a> you can use to tell your data story. These visuals allow you to highlight the data you want in order to explain insights you have discovered in your data that lead to actions your business can take. Bookmarks allow you to save the page as it is being viewed. By saving the page, potentially with cross-visual filtering, using bookmarks allows you to step through views of the report in a slide-like fashion to aid in telling a story with the data. </p>
			<p>When you add a bookmark, you save the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Current page</li>
				<li>Filters</li>
				<li>Slicers, including slicer type (for example, dropdown or list) and slicer state</li>
				<li>Cross-highlight filter state</li>
				<li>Sort order</li>
				<li>Drill-up/drill-down level</li>
				<li>Visibility of an object (by using<a id="_idTextAnchor227"></a> the <strong class="bold">Selection</strong> pane)</li>
				<li>Focus </li>
				<li>Spotlight</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The actual data on the report page is not saved, just the state of the visuals. This means that when the data is refreshed, the new data will be displayed, but with the same filters, slicers, visibility, and so forth. </p>
			<p>To add a bookmark, first get the report page in the state you want to save it in, then select <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> from the <strong class="bold">View</strong> tab. This will open the <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> panel.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer155" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_1.jpg" alt="Figure 11.1 – The Bookmarks panel can be opened from the View ribbon
" width="1021" height="134"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.1 – The Bookmarks panel can be opened from the View ribbon</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> panel, you click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to save your current page in its current configuration. After adding<a id="_idIndexMarker625"></a> the bookmark, you change the page's slicers, cross-filters, or cross-highlights and add a new bookmark to save those choices. You can switch pages and add bookmarks based on various configurations on that page. </p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer156" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_2.jpg" alt="Figure 11.2 – Selecting the Add button saves the state of the report page to the Bookmarks panel
" width="472" height="379"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.2 – Selecting the Add button saves the state of the report page to the Bookmarks panel</p>
			<p>You can also rename your bookmarks, reorder them, and group them into sections. </p>
			<p>Bookmarks can turn<a id="_idIndexMarker626"></a> your report into a tool for repeatable presentations, allowing you to control the story, presenting your data in the order that you want it to be presented. Bookmarks will also allow you to freely go off script in your presentation. You can highlight other data points, change slicers, or even skip to a different page, all the while knowing that you can get right back to where you were with the click of a button. </p>
			<p>You can also associate a bookmark with a button or an image. This will give your report a feeling of interactivity as your report consumers can click on buttons or images and get taken to a different page or the same page with different slicers and filters selected. </p>
			<p>As we will see in the next section, you can use the Selection pane alongside bookmarks to take your report to whole new levels of interactivity.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"></a>Using the selection pane </h2>
			<p>The Selection pane allows<a id="_idIndexMarker627"></a> you to do three things: control the layer order, control<a id="_idIndexMarker628"></a> the tab order, and show and hide elements on the reporting page. </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Select</strong> pane can be toggled on and off from the <strong class="bold">View</strong> tab, the same as the <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> panel.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer157" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_3.jpg" alt="Figure 11.3 – The Selection panel can be opened from the View ribbon

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.3 – The Selection panel can be opened from the View ribbon</p>
			<h3>Tab order</h3>
			<p>The first thing you need to know for the test is that you can control the tab order<a id="_idIndexMarker629"></a> for your report page. This is very important for visually impaired consumers who might be using an adaptive device to view your report. This is also nice for hands-on-keyboard-type people who like to tab through things rather than use the mouse.</p>
			<p>Tab order is just what it sounds like, it controls<a id="_idIndexMarker630"></a> what visualization is next highlighted by hitting the <em class="italic">Tab</em> key.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer158" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_4.jpg" alt="Figure 11.4 – Setting the tab order for our keyboard-first report users
" width="903" height="212"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.4 – Setting the tab order for our keyboard-first report users</p>
			<h3>Layer order</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Layer order</strong> tab controls the other two things<a id="_idIndexMarker631"></a> in the Selection pane, the layer order and the visibility.</p>
			<p>The layer order controls what visuals appear on top of other visuals. You can control this in two places: the <strong class="bold">Selection</strong> pane and the <strong class="bold">Format</strong> tab. The <strong class="bold">Format</strong> tab has the standard Microsoft Office <strong class="bold">Bring forward</strong> and <strong class="bold">Send backward</strong> choices. Using these buttons has the same effect as moving a visual upward or downward in the layer order. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer159" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_5.jpg" alt="Figure 11.5 – Bring forward and Send backward work exactly the same as in other Microsoft products
" width="897" height="416"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.5 – Bring forward and Send backward work exactly the same as in other Microsoft products</p>
			<p>The other key thing<a id="_idIndexMarker632"></a> you can do in the <strong class="bold">Layer order</strong> pane is to hide and show visualizations. You can then bookmark the state of the page with the visuals shown or hidden.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"></a>Creating custom tooltips </h2>
			<p>Tooltips appear when you hover <a id="_idIndexMarker633"></a>your mouse over a visualization. The tooltip will, by default, be a black box with gray text that displays information about the data point your mouse is over. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer160" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_6.jpg" alt="Figure 11.6 – By default, tooltips show the same data that's in the visualization
" width="633" height="367"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.6 – By default, tooltips show the same data that's in the visualization</p>
			<p>Tooltips are a great way to add information<a id="_idIndexMarker634"></a> to your report without cluttering up the reporting surface. You can add more data fields to the tooltip in the <strong class="bold">Tooltips</strong> region in the visuals pane.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer161" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_7.jpg" alt="Figure 11.7 – Providing the end user with more information using tooltips
" width="830" height="454"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.7 – Providing the end user with more information using tooltips</p>
			<p>You are not limited to just the gray<a id="_idIndexMarker635"></a> text on a black background. You can change the background color of the tooltip, the font of the text, and the color of both the label and the values.</p>
			<p>This lets you customize the tooltip to fit in with the rest of the report, keeping fonts and colors consistent throughout the report. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer162" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_8.jpg" alt="Figure 11.8 – You can change the colors and fonts for your tooltips. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.8 – You can change the colors and fonts for your tooltips. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility</p>
			<p>You can create<a id="_idIndexMarker636"></a> an entire report page that will display as a tooltip. This allows you to place visualizations in a tooltip, adding yet another layer of information while keeping the report canvas less cluttered.</p>
			<p>To create a tooltip page, add a new page to the report. In the <strong class="bold">Format</strong> pane for the new page, click on the <strong class="bold">Tooltips</strong> slider. You may also want to resize the page to the default tooltip size, but that is not a requirement. Just remember, you want this page to appear over a portion of your report surface, not completely obliterate it. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer163" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_9.jpg" alt="Figure 11.9 – Setting a page to be used for a tooltip

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.9 – Setting a page to be used for a tooltip</p>
			<p> On the <strong class="bold">Build</strong> visual for the<a id="_idIndexMarker637"></a> report page, add the fields you want to trigger the tooltip to the <strong class="bold">Tooltip</strong> area. You have the option of keeping all filters or not, much like a drillthrough page, which we will cover later in this chapter.</p>
			<p>Once you have added the visuals that you want to your tooltip page, go back to the visual you want to use on the tooltip page. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer164" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_10.jpg" alt="Figure 11.10 – Tooltip pages can really enhance your report, adding layers of data

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.10 – Tooltip pages can really enhance your report, adding layers of data</p>
			<p>Tooltip pages open<a id="_idIndexMarker638"></a> new layers of reporting options.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"></a>Interactions between visuals </h2>
			<p>One of the key powers that Power BI has is its ability to cross-filter and cross-highlight visualizations. This power creates dynamic<a id="_idIndexMarker639"></a> reports that allow users to interact with the data to explore the relationships between data points, creating new insights.</p>
			<p>As the report creator, you can control how visuals interact with each other, or if visuals interact at all. Interactivity is great, but there may be times when you want a visual on your report page to remain static. You may want to display total sales in a corner of your page, even if a report consumer filters the rest of the visuals down to a region or sales segment.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer165" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_11.jpg" alt="Figure 11.11 – This report page allows your report users to keep the total net revenue on the page while looking at the total net revenue for the regions

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.11 – This report page allows your report users to keep the total net revenue on the page while looking at the total net revenue for the regions</p>
			<p>You can see in the figure that all the visuals<a id="_idIndexMarker640"></a> on the blue rectangles are cross-filtered and cross-highlighted by the four region names. The card visualization in the gray box has the total for all the regions. This allows your report consumer to slice and dice the data any way they want and have a continual reference to the total number.</p>
			<p>By default, Power BI will cross-highlight visuals when possible; it's not possible to cross-highlight a card or a line chart, they can only be filtered. It makes sense if you think about it. You can change this default behavior in the options for the report. This is not a general setting, so it will only affect the current report. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer166" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_12.jpg" alt="Figure 11.12 – Changing the default cross-highlighting behavior to cross-filtering

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.12 – Changing the default cross-highlighting behavior to cross-filtering</p>
			<p>To change how individual<a id="_idIndexMarker641"></a> visualizations interact, you must enable the <strong class="bold">Edit interactions</strong> option. To enable <strong class="bold">Edit interactions</strong>, select any visual on the report page to make the <strong class="bold">Format</strong> ribbon tab available. Select the <strong class="bold">Format</strong> ribbon tab and click the <strong class="bold">Edit Interactions</strong> button.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer167" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_13.jpg" alt="Figure 11.13 – Edit interactions is enabled from the Format ribbon tab

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.13 – Edit interactions is enabled from the Format ribbon tab</p>
			<p>This will now allow you to control <a id="_idIndexMarker642"></a>how visuals interact with the highlighted visualization. The icons that now appear let you choose <strong class="bold">Cross Filter</strong> and, if available, <strong class="bold">Cross Highlight</strong>.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer168" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_14.jpg" alt="Figure 11.14 – Enabling Edit interactions adds buttons to every visualization

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.14 – Enabling Edit interactions adds buttons to every visualization</p>
			<p>It is important to understand that this choice is for how the selected visualization interacts with all the other visualizations on the report page. For the <strong class="bold">Total Net Revenue</strong> card to <em class="italic">not</em> be cross-filtered, you must highlight each visual and select <strong class="bold">None</strong>.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer169" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.15 – Selecting None means the highlighted visual won't interact with this one</p>
			<p>You must do this for every visualization on the page. If you add a new visualization, you will have to highlight<a id="_idIndexMarker643"></a> it and select <strong class="bold">None</strong> for interactions. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"></a>Configuring navigation for a report </h2>
			<p>Having a clear path to navigate<a id="_idIndexMarker644"></a> your report goes together with the concept of using data<a id="_idIndexMarker645"></a> to tell your story. Clear report navigation allows your report users to move from one page in your report to the next, move from one visual to another, and return to where they started. The design of your report navigation is important because if report consumers get confused navigating your reports, they will become frustrated and not use the report, so all your hard work will have been for nothing.</p>
			<p>You have already seen one of the coolest ways to implement navigation: buttons linked to bookmarks! </p>
			<h3>Navigation buttons</h3>
			<p>To configure navigation<a id="_idIndexMarker646"></a> within a report, it is recommended to use buttons. You will configure those buttons on either a dedicated page or a pane within your report. You can add a button to your report by selecting one of the buttons from the <strong class="bold">Buttons</strong> dropdown on the <strong class="bold">Insert</strong> tab of the ribbon. After selecting the button added to your report, you can enable an action for the button by clicking<a id="_idIndexMarker647"></a> on it and then, under the <strong class="bold">Format button</strong> pane, toggling <strong class="bold">Action</strong>, and then selecting the kind of action you'd like the button to use, in this case a bookmark. Once the <strong class="bold">Bookmark</strong> type is selected, you then select which bookmark you'd like the button action to take. </p>
			<p>Using an action associated with a bookmark can easily make it appear that a navigation pane opens and closes. All you need to do is create two bookmarks for the report page: one with the navigation pane hidden and one with it visible. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer170" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_16.jpg" alt="Figure 11.16 – Clicking on the button opens the bookmark where the slicer pane is visible
" width="1153" height="577"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.16 – Clicking on the button opens the bookmark where the slicer pane is visible</p>
			<p>Once the report consumer is done selecting the slicers, they can close it by clicking on another button that takes them to the page bookmarked with the slicer pane hidden.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer171" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_17.jpg" alt='Figure 11.17 – Clicking on the arrow "closes" the slicer pane. We know it just takes us to the bookmark with the slicer pane hidden

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.17 – Clicking on the arrow "closes" the slicer pane. We know it just takes us to the bookmark with the slicer pane hidden</p>
			<p>This ability to use the selection pane, bookmarks, and actions on images and buttons can make your report<a id="_idIndexMarker648"></a> more interactive and allow you to free up space for delivering information. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"></a>Applying sorting </h2>
			<p>By default, Power BI will sort data<a id="_idIndexMarker649"></a> alphanumerically. Fortunately, this is case insensitive, but it still could be a limiting factor for using Power BI. After all, April is not the first month of the year.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer172" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_18.jpg" alt="Figure 11.18 – This is not the order the months of the year should be in
" width="582" height="391"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.18 – This is not the order the months of the year should be in</p>
			<p>We want our months to be sorted by month <a id="_idIndexMarker650"></a>number, not by month name. In Power BI, we do this by choosing a different column to control the sorting. In the case of my <strong class="source-inline">Month</strong> column, I have a second column that is the year concatenated with the month number named <strong class="source-inline">MonthKey</strong>. I can choose this column as my sort column and it will force the <strong class="source-inline">Month</strong> column to sort numerically, not alphabetically. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer173" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_19.jpg" alt="Figure 11.19 – Selecting a column that is sorted in the order you want
" width="618" height="447"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.19 – Selecting a column that is sorted in the order you want</p>
			<p>Now our visualization is sorted<a id="_idIndexMarker651"></a> by a column that doesn't have to be displayed.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer174" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_20.jpg" alt="Figure 11.20 – Changing the sort column puts the months in the correct order
" width="1271" height="772"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.20 – Changing the sort column puts the months in the correct order</p>
			<p>This is not just limited to date fields. If you have suborganizations <a id="_idIndexMarker652"></a>that you always want to be sorted nonalphabetically, you can do the same thing to create a column to force the sorting the way you want it. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer175" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_21.jpg" alt="Figure 11.21 – Sort by is not just for dates. You can force other categorical values to sort in the order you need them to
" width="732" height="547"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.21 – Sort by is not just for dates. You can force other categorical values to sort in the order  you need them to</p>
			<p>This way, every time<a id="_idIndexMarker653"></a> you create a visual sorted on this column, it will sort in the order you want.</p>
			<p>It is important to know for the exam that you can choose to change the default sort order of a column by designating a sort by column. It is also noted that this does not just apply to date fields; you can use this for other types of columns too. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"></a>Sync slicers </h2>
			<p>You can control slicers<a id="_idIndexMarker654"></a> and make a slicer on one page affect one or more other pages in the report. You do this by enabling the <strong class="bold">Sync slicers</strong> panel in the <strong class="bold">View</strong> ribbon.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer176" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_22.jpg" alt="Figure 11.22 – A landing page of slicers
" width="1628" height="943"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.22 – A landing page of slicers</p>
			<p>One of the nice things you can do is to set the start page of the report to have all of your slicers. This allows users to filter the rest of the report. This behavior more closely mimics the setting of parameters some of your report consumers may have experienced with SQL Server Reporting Services or paginated reports.</p>
			<p>One thing to be aware of is that you can choose whether to have the slicer show up on the report page. Not displaying the slicer on a report page will give you more canvas to work on, at the expense of possibly confusing your report consumers on how the page has been sliced. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"></a>Using drillthrough and cross-filter </h2>
			<p>When creating reports, you may want<a id="_idIndexMarker655"></a> to have a page of summary information and then pages<a id="_idIndexMarker656"></a> with more detailed information for specific categories or subsets of data. In these cases, you can use the drillthrough feature to start viewing a report page at a wider and more general level and then drill into the detail on another page. For example, if you start at a report page that shows rolled-up sales data for all product categories, you can select a specific product or category of products and use drillthrough to navigate to a product page that is filtered to the selected product or category of products. Using this capability, you wouldn't need to design specific report pages for each product or product category, because each time, a potentially unique product filter would be applied per the selection of the user.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer177" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_23.jpg" alt="Figure 11.23 – Drillthrough allows you to navigate from one visual to another page
" width="1270" height="584"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.23 – Drillthrough allows you to navigate from one visual to another page</p>
			<p>To create a drillthrough, you first create a report page. Then, from the <strong class="bold">Values</strong> section of the <strong class="bold">Visualizations</strong> pane, drag the field for which you want to enable drillthrough in the drillthrough filters as well.</p>
			<p>You have the option of keeping all the filters from the source page, which is any slicer, filter, and cross-filter or cross-highlights selected, or only filtering the page on the selected category.</p>
			<p>When a drillthrough is added to a report, Power BI will automatically add a back button to the report page. This is used for navigation but is fully editable by the report designer. </p>
			<p>The cross-report drillthrough<a id="_idIndexMarker657"></a> option is outside the scope of this exam, but you can<a id="_idIndexMarker658"></a> use it to direct your report consumers to an entirely different report instead of just another page in the current report.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"></a>Drilling down into data using interactive visuals</h2>
			<p>Drilldown and drill up are totally unrelated to drillthrough. Drilldown<a id="_idIndexMarker659"></a> relates to hierarchal visualizations, such as matrixes. If you have added a hierarchy<a id="_idIndexMarker660"></a> to a matrix, you can go to the next level of the hierarchy or you can expand the entire level. You also have the option to have + and – signs to expand a single element while leaving the rest of the elements at their current level.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"></a>Exporting report data </h2>
			<p>Although Power BI<a id="_idIndexMarker663"></a> can be used to create awesome, interactive, digital-first reports, sometimes your report consumers might want to export the data from a visual. They may want this data for further analysis. They may want to use Power BI to filter a dataset down to the exact subset of data they need. They may just want to grab a historical record of the data.</p>
			<p>Some re<a id="_idTextAnchor237"></a>ports will use Microsoft Purview Information Protection and will prohibit the export of data. Some organizations will want to protect data in reports and not allow users to export where the data could be shared outside the organization or used for unintended purposes.</p>
			<p>As the report creator, you can choose whether your report consumers can export data. This is a setting you set<a id="_idIndexMarker664"></a> in Power BI Desktop. The default allows any end user to export summarized data only. If you want to change this, you must go to the <strong class="bold">Report settings</strong> page in the <strong class="bold">Options</strong> menu. </p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.26 – Controlling how much, if any, data your report users can export</p>
			<p>Your three choices are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Allow end users to export summarized data.</li>
				<li>Allow end users to export summarized and underlying data.</li>
				<li>Don't allow export.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These three options<a id="_idIndexMarker665"></a> can be set in your Power BI tenant. If they are, it's important to understand that the most restrictive option will be chosen. So, if your tenant allows the underlying data to be exported, but you choose, for your report, to not allow downloads, downloads will be disallowed.</p>

			<p>In this section, we learned about many ways we can enhance reports, including interactions between visuals, drillthrough, and securing data within a report, among other topics. Next, let's look at how we can design reports for mobile devices for use on the go.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"></a>Designing reports for mobile devices</h1>
			<p>Power BI embraces the mobile-first<a id="_idIndexMarker666"></a> world that is quickly approaching, if it is not<a id="_idIndexMarker667"></a> already here. Many report users will prefer interacting with reports on their mobile phones or tablets. Power BI works with all modern browsers, so this is not a problem. The problem is, especially for phones and smaller tablets, the default landscape orientation is not the way your end users usually use their phone. You can create an additional view that is optimized for mobile devices and displays in portrait orientation. Power BI has a mobile layout option that, alongside the Power BI app for those devices and the Power BI service, can detect when a device is in portrait mode and change to a more thumb-friendly vertical alignment.</p>
			<p>To create a mobile-optimized version of your report, you can do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Design a mobile layout view, where you can drag and drop certain visuals onto a phone emulator canvas.</li>
				<li>Use visuals and slicers that are suitable for use on small mobile screens.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you publish your report, the mobile version is published and enabled automatically. </p>
			<p>To create a mobile-optimized<a id="_idIndexMarker668"></a> view of your report, select the <strong class="bold">Mobile layout</strong> option on the <strong class="bold">View</strong> ribbon. This will open a scrollable canvas where you can add back the visuals<a id="_idIndexMarker669"></a> that were on the report page. Drag the visuals you want from the <strong class="bold">Page visuals</strong> pane onto the reporting canvas. You can then resize and reposition them as you see fit. </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer181" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_11_27.jpg" alt="Figure 11.27 – Mobile report layout page
" width="1455" height="781"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.27 – Mobile report layout page</p>
			<p>Visuals on the mobile page will continue to cross-filter and cross-highlight. Slicers will continue to work as before.</p>
			<p>Sometimes you may want to change some of the options for your visualizations. Font sizes may need to be changed or background colors added or removed to make the report more readable. You make these changes by selecting the visualization and editing the options in the <strong class="bold">Visualizations</strong> panel. If you do make a change here, it will only affect the mobile layout. Power BI will also generate<a id="_idIndexMarker670"></a> a small, visual marker<a id="_idIndexMarker671"></a> on the section and the setting you changed.</p>

			<p>Power BI fully embraces our mobile-first world and natively allows you to create mobile-friendly report layouts.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned how to make your reports even more interactive and user-friendly. We configured bookmarks that allow you to enhance your reports with a bit of storytelling. We used the selection pane to up our bookmark game, making our reports even more interactive. We also saw how we could use bookmarking and buttons to create our own highly interactive navigation panes. Alternatively, we can also affect navigation by using drillthrough filters to allow navigation from one visual to a whole page of visuals. Along these lines, we also set up synched slicers, allowing slicers on one page to filter visuals on one or more other pages. </p>
			<p>You saw how custom tooltips allow you to create visually interesting mouse-overs, allowing you to keep your report pages cleaner and presenting data to your report consumers only when they want it.</p>
			<p>We also looked at how visuals can interact with each other, and how and why we can prevent that interaction. Sometimes you want to filter, sometimes highlight, and sometimes you just want a visual to stand alone. </p>
			<p>Speaking of sometimes not wanting the defaults provided by Power BI, we also explored the world of alternative sorting. The months of the year are not normally sorted alphabetically after all. </p>
			<p>We used the power of hierarchies by using drilldown and drill up to navigate them. This lets report consumers initially see a summary number and then drill into the data to see an explanation for the number. </p>
			<p>From a data standpoint, we looked at how our users can export report data from a visual. You can choose whether your report consumers can export all, summarized, or none of the data from a visual.</p>
			<p>Finally, we looked at the mobile report layout and how to make our reports more mobile device- and thumb-friendly when it's appropriate.</p>
			<p>We will explore exposing insights from our data in the next chapter. </p>
