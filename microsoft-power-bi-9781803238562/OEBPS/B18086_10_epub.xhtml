			<p>One of the main reasons organizations adopt Power BI is to enable dynamic storytelling using data with vibrant visuals. Report designers create reports using specific datasets and sometimes, to tell a whole story, you need to use data across different datasets and reports. This is where Power BI dashboards become useful. </p>
			<p>A dashboard is one place where you can see all the relevant information about something. In a car, the dashboard contains information about the speed of the car, what gear it is in, whether the lights are on, the temperature of the cabin environment, and even the volume of the sound system. All the data from this example comes from different systems and some inputs can vary when it comes to importance while driving the car, but all of them are going to be important to the person operating the car.</p>
			<p>When used properly, dashboards become an integral component of a Power BI solution. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introducing Power BI dashboards</li>
				<li>Pinning tiles</li>
				<li>Optimizing dashboards</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"></a>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>The following are the requirements for this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Access to the Power BI service (<a href="https://www.powerbi.com">https://www.powerbi.com</a>) using a work or school account</li>
				<li>Power BI reports and data published to the Power BI service where we can apply the features covered in this chapter</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's begin by introducing the concept of Power BI dashboards and how they work.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"></a>Introducing Power BI dashboards</h1>
			<p>Dashboards in <a id="_idIndexMarker593"></a>Power BI are where users of the business intelligence solution can go to see all the important information without having to switch between multiple reports. A dashboard is a type of content that is created and used from a Power BI workspace. Dashboards are only created with the Power BI service (<a href="https://www.powerbi.com">https://www.powerbi.com</a>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker594"></a>not with Power BI Desktop. Dashboards tend to rely on visuals created in reports; however, it is possible to use tools such as Q&amp;A to dynamically create visuals and directly pin them to a dashboard. Dashboards rely on the underlying datasets and data models used in reports, and they provide a new way of consuming the data, which provides some unique advantages over reports.</p>
			<p>It should also be said that it's important to understand the distinction here between what Power BI refers to as a dashboard and what Power BI calls a report. Reports are typically created using the Desktop tool (sometimes can be created on the Power BI service) and can be saved as a PBIX file, while a true dashboard content type is only created on the Power BI service and there is no file format for dashboards. We're drawing this distinction because sometimes, users will create a Power BI report and refer to it as a "dashboard" due to the use of interactive visuals in the report. To Power BI, these are two different types of content and have different features, capabilities, and uses.</p>
			<p>On the Power BI service, you can tell the difference between reports and dashboards by looking at the workspace and noticing the different icons and type designations, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.1</em>:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.1 – Difference between a Power BI report and a dashboard</p>
			<p>Reports are best used when they can be focused on a specific topic of data or set of questions about a particular dataset or related datasets. </p>
			<p>For example, when looking at product sales, we might have visuals showing sales by product categories, regions, sellers, or fiscal period (years, quarters, or months). Sales information will be curated into a sales data model and used within a sales report that allows business users to drill into the details of the sales information. </p>
			<p>Likewise, inventory data would also be curated into an inventory data model and reports created showing historical and up-to-date inventory information for various warehouses, regions, and store locations. Inventory reports might also contain information<a id="_idIndexMarker595"></a> from shipping and supply chain partners to answer critical questions about having products at the right place and time. Since a retail business needs to have products to sell them, inventory and supply chain information is also vital to a business.</p>
			<p>Sales managers and inventory managers will likely use the reports on a frequent basis as their primary<a id="_idIndexMarker596"></a> responsibility is for those areas (sales and inventory). However, the <strong class="bold">Chief Financial Officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CFO</strong>) might need to have an understanding of both functions of the organization. The CFO will be interested in not only the margin being made on the sale of products but also the cost of the raw materials and third-party products that are being sold. So, the CFO will need to ask questions about the sales data as well as the inventory and supply chain data, and this is where Power BI dashboards become powerful tools that allow data from both to be included on a single page for easy information consumption.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 10.2</em>, we can see how sales data and inventory data both end up being inputs to the leadership dashboards through the use of both Power BI reports and dashboards. Different content will have different audiences:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.2 – Diagram showing the relationship between datasets, reports, and dashboards</p>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker597"></a>we know how dashboards can be useful, let's explore how they can be created and used.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"></a>Creating a dashboard</h2>
			<p>To create a<a id="_idIndexMarker598"></a> dashboard, first log into the Power BI service at <a href="https://www.powerbi.com">https://www.powerbi.com</a>. This requires a work or school account with Microsoft to use Power BI. The Power BI service is where workspaces are hosted and where Power BI apps are created, shared, and hosted as well.</p>
			<p>Once logged into the Power BI service, navigate to the workspace you'd like to create a dashboard in and then select <strong class="bold">New</strong> under the menu at the top:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer144" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_10_03.jpg" alt="Figure 10.3 – New menu on the Power BI service showing different types of content that can be created, including dashboards
" width="571" height="984"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.3 – New menu on the Power BI service showing different types of content that can be created, including dashboards</p>
			<p>Next, provide a <a id="_idIndexMarker599"></a>name for the dashboard and click <strong class="bold">Create</strong>. If your organization requires setting a sensitivity label, then be sure to select the value for this option when asked. A newly created dashboard will be a blank or empty canvas to which visuals from any report in the workspace can be pinned and organized. Dashboards can be viewed on the Power BI service as part of a Power BI app or from the various Power BI mobile apps, which makes the consumption of Power BI insights easy from nearly any device or location. Dashboards are organized into workspaces the same as reports and datasets.</p>
			<p>While the data contained in a dashboard may be the most valuable component, if the data is not presented in a visually appealing way, it won't be as useful to the organization. Colors used in visuals play a big role in the impact they make; so, let's next look at how<a id="_idIndexMarker600"></a> we can use themes with dashboards.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"></a>Setting a dashboard theme</h2>
			<p>Dashboards are<a id="_idIndexMarker601"></a> meant to be a single canvas that shows the most important information the user needs to see. As such, visual aspects such as themes are important to best convey the information. Dashboards support theming either with light, dark, color-blind-friendly, or custom themes. When using a theme, every visual on the canvas will use the colors of the theme. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">See the limitations list at the end of this subsection to best understand how dashboard themes work and what you can and can't do with them.</p>
			<p>The built-in theme called <strong class="bold">Light</strong> will have a light-gray and white background with black text, while the <strong class="bold">Dark</strong> theme provides a dark-gray and darker gray background with white text. The color-blind-friendly built-in theme will force visuals to use colors that are easier to distinguish for users who are color-blind.</p>
			<p>If you'd like to match your organization's color theme or use seasonal colors, this is possible by using a custom theme with a JSON template file. For example, the JSON file of the <strong class="bold">Light</strong> theme looks like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">{</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    "name": "Light",</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    "foreground": "#000000",</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    "background": "#EAEAEA",</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    "dataColors": ["#01B8AA", "#374649", "#FD625E", "#F2C80F", "#5F6B6D", "#8AD4EB", "#FE9666", "#A66999"],</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    "tiles": {</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">        "background": "#FFFFFF",</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">        "color": "#000000"</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    },</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    "visualStyles": {</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">        "*": {</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">            "*": {</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">                "*": [{</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">                    "color": {</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">                        "solid": {</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">                            "color": "#000000"</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">                        }</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">                    }</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">                }]</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">            }</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">        }</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    }</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">}</pre>
			<p>Using this<a id="_idIndexMarker602"></a> template, you can define a custom color theme for dashboards to meet your requirements. </p>
			<p>Limitations for applying themes to dashboards include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dashboard themes will not cascade to live reports, paginated reports, web, workbooks, or image tiles.</li>
				<li>Dashboard themes can only be set using the Power BI service from a web browser, not the mobile app.</li>
				<li>Custom themes only work with tiles containing visuals pinned from reports.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we understand how dashboards can be created, let's discover the functionality they provide when using deployed dashboards.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"></a>Using a dashboard</h2>
			<p>Dashboards are<a id="_idIndexMarker603"></a> meant to be used for information consumption, and typically in a less interactive way compared to reports. This means that when you click a visual in a dashboard, you're not going to slice or filter data in other visuals, as they may use different data models that may not have relationships set up to enable cross-filtering. When you click a visual in a dashboard, you will be taken to the source report from which it was pinned. In a way, the dashboard is the first place to go to see the most important data, but it is also a switchboard of sorts that allows you to navigate to reports if you want more information after viewing the top-level important information. Therefore, dashboards become a great tool for senior leaders of an organization.</p>
			<p>Additionally, dashboards and reports<a id="_idIndexMarker604"></a> both offer <strong class="bold">focus mode</strong>. Focus mode is a feature of Power BI reports and dashboards where the selected visual takes over the entire canvas of the report or dashboard to allow the user to temporarily get a more detailed look at the data used for that visual. You can exit focus mode by clicking <strong class="bold">Exit focus mode</strong> or <strong class="bold">Back to the report</strong> in the top left-hand corner of the canvas.</p>
			<p>To set up dashboards that your users will want to use, you'll want to add content to them. This is achieved by pinning tiles that contain visuals and other content, which we'll cover in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"></a>Pinning tiles</h1>
			<p>Content on a <a id="_idIndexMarker605"></a>dashboard is referred to as a <strong class="bold">tile</strong>. Tiles <a id="_idIndexMarker606"></a>can be visuals from a report in the workspace, web content, images, text, video, or real-time streaming data. After creating a blank dashboard, it is possible to add any of these content types from the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> menu by clicking <strong class="bold">Add a tile</strong>, except report visuals. To add a visual from an existing report, you need to first navigate to the report and select the <strong class="bold">Pin visual</strong> option that pops up after hovering the mouse over a visual, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.4</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer145" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_10_04.jpg" alt="Figure 10.4 – Pin button used to pin a visual to a dashboard
" width="384" height="274"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.4 – Pin button used to pin a visual to a dashboard</p>
			<p>When visuals are pinned to a dashboard, they can have filters applied. Reports provide interactivity where users can filter or even select values from other visuals to cross-filter the display of information, which changes with the user's selection. Dashboards, on the other hand, will provide a static representation of the data you want to use to tell the story. For example, you might have product sales data representing sales in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, but for the dashboard used by the president of the United<a id="_idIndexMarker607"></a> States subsidiary, you want to tell the story of <a id="_idIndexMarker608"></a>product sales in the United States only. From the global sales report, you would apply the filter to the <strong class="source-inline">CountryRegion</strong> field to only show data from the United States. Once this filter has been applied (using a filter or a slicer visual), the visual with filtered data can then be pinned to the dashboard.</p>
			<p>The Power BI service stores a cache of data to enable performant dashboards with various filters applied for the pinned visuals. More information on optimizing the cache of data used for dashboard tiles will be covered in the <em class="italic">Optimizing dashboards</em> section.</p>
			<p>After clicking the <strong class="bold">Pin</strong> <strong class="bold">visual</strong> button, you'll get the option to pin this visual to an existing dashboard or a new dashboard, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.5</em>. Selecting the name of the existing dashboard will add this visual to the dashboard:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer146" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_10_05.jpg" alt="Figure 10.5 – Pin visual to dashboard selection
" width="1010" height="448"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.5 – Pin visual to dashboard selection</p>
			<p>After the dashboard has been selected (or a new dashboard created) and the visual has been pinned, the notice shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.6</em> will appear in the top right-hand corner of the window. This lets you know that the pinning was successful and allows you to quickly go<a id="_idIndexMarker609"></a> to the impacted dashboard or create a mobile<a id="_idIndexMarker610"></a> layout for the dashboard. We will cover mobile layouts in detail in the next section:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer147" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_10_06.jpg" alt="Figure 10.6 – Notice that the visual has been pinned to the dashboard
" width="758" height="265"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.6 – Notice that the visual has been pinned to the dashboard</p>
			<p>Since it is possible to use themes when building reports, it's possible that visuals being pinned to dashboard tiles will start with a theme. When you pin visuals from reports that use a theme to dashboards that use a theme, you'll see this message asking for confirmation for the theming of the dashboard tile to either use the destination theme or the current theme, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.7</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer148" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_10_07.jpg" alt="Figure 10.7 – Selection of tile theming when pinning a visual
" width="1024" height="489"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.7 – Selection of tile theming when pinning a visual</p>
			<p>After visuals have been pinned to a dashboard, it's important to review the dashboard and potentially adjust how the visuals or other elements have been pinned. If you open the dashboard you've created, you'll be able to drag and drop the pinned tiles, as well as resizing them and adjusting things such as adding comments, adding functionality such as displaying the last refresh time, setting custom links, and changing the title and subtitles.</p>
			<p>While most often, visuals will be pinned to dashboards, it is also possible to pin a whole report page to a dashboard. When this happens, the entire report becomes a tile in the dashboard <a id="_idIndexMarker611"></a>and retains the live interactivity and cross-filtering<a id="_idIndexMarker612"></a> capabilities of the report. Reports pinned to dashboards are not visible in the mobile layout and they may have performance implications; both of these topics will be covered in the next section as part of optimization.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"></a>Optimizing dashboards</h1>
			<p>Dashboards <a id="_idIndexMarker613"></a>are a useful way to tell a story using data and visuals in Power BI but if they are not optimized to the screen they are being presented on or if the dashboard takes a long time to load, they lose their effectiveness. In this section, we'll see how we can optimize dashboards for these scenarios to make them the<a id="_idIndexMarker614"></a> most useful starting place for Power BI information consumers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"></a>Configuring views of a dashboard</h2>
			<p>To recap, Power<a id="_idIndexMarker615"></a> BI is an online service that allows organizations to see the most important information from anywhere. This is accomplished<a id="_idIndexMarker616"></a> using a <strong class="bold">Software-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) website at <a href="https://www.powerbi.com">https://www.powerbi.com</a> as well as mobile apps for iOS and Android phones and tablets and Windows devices.</p>
			<p>However, since these device screens can range from small hand-held sizes to very large, dashboards being created can be consumed optimally for every screen size. Large screen devices such as desktop web browsers and tablets will use the same layout, but mobile phones need an optimized dashboard layout to increase their usability due to the screen size. </p>
			<p>To optimize a dashboard to a mobile screen, select <strong class="bold">Mobile layout</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> menu.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer149" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_10_08.jpg" alt="Figure 10.8 – Mobile layout under the Edit menu
" width="299" height="287"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.8 – Mobile layout under the Edit menu</p>
			<p>You'll now be taken to the <strong class="bold">Edit mobile layout</strong> screen, where you can arrange the order in which tiles will be shown when viewing the dashboard on a mobile device. Since most dashboards tend to have KPI visuals all in a row at the top of the default or web layout, the mobile layout allows you to pick the order in which they will be presented when viewing from the Power BI mobile apps.</p>
			<p>While editing the mobile layout, you can reorder the tiles and or also unpin visuals from the mobile view. This is useful when you want a tile to be shown when viewing on the web but not shown when viewing on a mobile device.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer150" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_10_09.jpg" alt="Figure 10.9 – Edit mobile layout
" width="733" height="572"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.9 – Edit mobile layout</p>
			<p>To exit editing the mobile layout, simply select <strong class="bold">Web layout</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Mobile layout</strong> menu on the top right-hand side of the screen.</p>
			<p>It is important to note that if report tiles are used (pinning an entire report page to a dashboard), then they will not be visible on the mobile layout or able to be consumed in the Power BI mobile app. This is due to how report tiles provide additional interactivity, as well a<a id="_idIndexMarker617"></a>s performance impact, which will be discussed in the next subsection.</p>
			<p>Once the layout has been optimized for the devices used by the intended consumers, next, you need to make sure the performance is optimized.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"></a>Optimizing the performance of a dashboard</h2>
			<p>The Power BI <a id="_idIndexMarker618"></a>service includes the ability to diagnose poor performanc<a id="_idTextAnchor221"></a>e in <a id="_idIndexMarker619"></a>dashboards. The <strong class="bold">performance inspector</strong> will review the dashboard that has been created and make recommendations to increase the performance of the dashboard.</p>
			<p>To open the performance inspector, click <strong class="bold">Performance inspector</strong> under the <strong class="bold">File</strong> menu when viewing the dashboard.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer151" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_10_10.jpg" alt="Figure 10.10 – Launching performance inspector from the File menu when viewing a dashboard
" width="445" height="453"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.10 – Launching performance inspector from the File menu when viewing a dashboard</p>
			<p>When the<a id="_idIndexMarker620"></a> performance inspector opens, you'll see items that are scored green, yellow, or red, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.11</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer152" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_10_11.jpg" alt="Figure 10.11 – Dashboard performance inspector findings
" width="1148" height="688"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.11 – Dashboard performance inspector findings</p>
			<p>These scores<a id="_idIndexMarker621"></a> will give you an indication of which items will have the most impact on the performance of your report. Under the <strong class="bold">NEED ATTENTION</strong> section be sure to review the performance inspector findings and make changes to your dashboard as suggested. Some common findings include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Limiting the use of report tiles to one per dashboard</strong> – When multiple report tiles are used, the dashboard can show multiple pages of reports of live data and cross-filtering at the same time. This isn't possible with reports, so it is not advised to do this on dashboards.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Removing the use of single-visual report tiles</strong> – It is possible to create a report with one visual and then pin that entire report to a dashboard. In this case, it is suggested to pin the visual rather than the whole page as this will remove the requirement for live interactivity back to the report data. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Power BI service keeps data in dashboards up to date by keeping a cache of the data needed for the dashboard, which aids in performance. When data in the underlying dataset gets refreshed, the service will update this cache. It is also possible to force this cache to update by clicking the refresh button on the toolbar (upper right-hand side) when viewing the dashboard. </p>
			<p>You can also set the service to automatically refresh the cache used for dashboard tiles by enabling automatic tile refresh in the dataset options and setting the refresh frequency, as<a id="_idIndexMarker622"></a> shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.12</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer153" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18086_10_12.jpg" alt="Figure 10.12 – Automatic dashboard tile refresh settings
" width="1095" height="397"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.12 – Automatic dashboard tile refresh settings</p>
			<p>Once the automatic dashboard tile refresh is set, the service will handle updating the data cache used <a id="_idIndexMarker623"></a>for dashboards, but users will still have the option to manually refresh if necessary. Remember that this will not impact report tiles, as data used for report tiles is always live, going back to the dataset of the report.</p>
			<p>Optimized dashboards are a key ingredient to telling a story with data and make a Power BI solution useful from nearly any device at any location.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned about Power BI dashboards. Dashboards provide a way to bring attention to the most important information from multiple reports within a workspace.</p>
			<p>We learned the differences between dashboards and reports, how they can be created, how visuals and reports can be pinned, and how users will use dashboards from the Power BI service on the web as well as from mobile devices anywhere. We learned the details of how pinning tiles works, dashboard layouts can be edited, tiles can be resized, and custom dashboard themes can be configured.</p>
			<p>When it comes to optimizing dashboards, we learned that dashboards should be optimized for the screen size where they will be consumed, and the Power BI service provides a way to do this to optimize the flow of tiles on dashboards for smaller mobile device screens. We also learned how the performance inspector can help optimize dashboards to ensure the best performance.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we'll explore ways of enhancing reports with capabilities such as navigation tooltips and buttons.</p>
