<h2 class="chap-title">Custom Email</h2>
<p class="noindent">Having finished <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>, we’ve now accomplished the main task we set out to do: We have our own website on a custom domain. In this chapter, we’ll include two important refinements: custom email (<a href="ch17.xhtml#sec17_1">Section 17.1</a> and <a href="ch17.xhtml#sec17_2">Section 17.2</a>) and site analytics (<a href="ch17.xhtml#sec17_3">Section 17.3</a>). They’re in the same chapter because the solutions we recommend are both provided by the same company (Google) and therefore fit nicely together.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter also brings <em>Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout to Be Dangerous</em> to a conclusion. In <a href="ch17.xhtml#sec17_4">Section 17.4</a>, we’ll offer some final reflections on just how far we’ve come and make some suggestions on where to go next.</p>
<section>
<h3 class="h3" id="sec17_1">17.1 Google Mail</h3>
<p class="noindent">The specific global email service we recommend is Google mail (Gmail). We use Gmail because, as one of Google’s core consumer-facing businesses, Gmail is supported on a large variety of devices and other services. It is also available and accessible basically anywhere at any time since it is running on Google’s core infrastructure— that means you don’t have to worry about some rinky-dink server outage taking down your access to email. Things have to go very wrong on the Internet to prevent you from being able to access Gmail.</p>
<p class="indent">Gmail’s spam filtering is also top-notch, as it leverages both Google’s expertise in machine learning and the millions of users who are on Gmail to figure out how to distinguish legitimate email from spam. If you use an email service that requires you to deal with inadequate spam filtering, we can promise you that with Gmail you rarely end up with spam in your inbox, or with real messages in your spam folder. It feels like a solved problem.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_620"></span>Lastly, we actually like the Gmail interface… We know that some people don’t, but hey, you know what they say about opinions. We find that searching email on Google is always fast and accurate (something that we can’t say about other systems that we’ve used in the past), and there are nice little power-user features that make life easier (like the ability to unsend a message within 30 seconds or the dots-and-pluses trick (<a href="ch17.xhtml#box17_1">Box 17.1</a>)).</p>
<aside epub:type="sidebar" class="sidebar1" id="box17_1">
<p class="sb-title1"><strong>Box 17.1: Gmail Dots and Pluses Trick</strong></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Many people don’t know this, but when you have a Gmail email address, you actually have a basically infinite set of sub-email addresses that can tie into your account without needing to do any setup. This is a nice way to pre-filter your email by giving different people, or websites that you don’t fully trust, a slightly different address. Then you can easily have Gmail move any mail sent to an email variant into a folder.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">What do we mean? Let’s say you have the email address <code><a href="http://yourname@gmail.com">yourname@gmail.com</a></code>.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The first trick is that Gmail doesn’t care about dots in your email address. So, if you tell someone to email you at <code><a href="http://your.name@gmail.com">your.name@gmail.com</a></code>, that will still end up in the inbox for <code><a href="http://yourname@gmail.com">yourname@gmail.com</a></code>—and you’ll be able to see that it was sent to <code><a href="http://your.name@gmail.com">your.name@gmail.com</a></code>. The lone caveat here is that you can’t have two periods in a row. So <code><a href="http://your..name@gmail.com">your..name@gmail.com</a></code> wouldn’t work, but there would be nothing wrong with <code><a href="http://y.o.u.r.n.a.m.e@gmail.com">y.o.u.r.n.a.m.e@gmail.com</a></code>. Eventually, though, you run out of variations…</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The second trick is that you have the ability to create a limitless number of ad hoc emails by adding a plus sign, <code>+</code>, to the end of your regular email and then whatever additional text you desire. In other words,</p>
<p class="codelink"><a href="ch17_images.xhtml#p620pro01a" id="p620pro01">Click here to view code image</a></p>
<pre class="pre1">yourname+travelsite@gmail.com</pre>
<p class="sb-noindent">and</p>
<p class="codelink"><a href="ch17_images.xhtml#p620pro02a" id="p620pro02">Click here to view code image</a></p>
<pre class="pre1">yourname+shadysite@gmail.com</pre>
<p class="sb-noindent">both end up going to <code><a href="http://yourname@gmail.com">yourname@gmail.com</a></code>. This lets you use distinct email addresses for different sites.</p>
</aside>
<p class="indent">So what are the downsides of using Gmail for your custom domain? Well, unlike the free service (the one where your email is <a href="http://something@gmail.com">something@gmail.com</a>), you have to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_621"></span>pay for it. Google offers custom Gmail via its general suite of cloud productivity tools called Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), which (as of this writing) costs $6/user/month for the Business Starter plan. (Note that each user can have up to 30 <em>aliases</em>, or other email addresses that all go to the same inbox, so there’s no need to pay for multiple users in this case.) For more details, see the Workspace pricing page (<a href="https://workspace.google.com/pricing.html">https://workspace.google.com/pricing.html</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Some people have also expressed privacy concerns about Google’s services. While this may apply to Gmail’s consumer service, which serves ads based on email content, Workspace is different, as noted in Google’s FAQ:</p>
<p class="blockquotet"><strong>Does Google use my organization’s data in Google Workspace services or Cloud Platform for advertising purposes?</strong></p>
<p class="blockquotei">No. There are no ads in Google Workspace Services or Google Cloud Platform, and we have no plans to change this in the future. We do not scan for advertising purposes in Gmail or other Google Workspace services. Google does not collect or use data in Google Workspace services for advertising purposes.</p>
<p class="blockquotei">The process is different for our free offerings and the consumer space. For information on our free consumer products, be sure to check Google’s Privacy and Terms page for more consumer tools and information relating to consumer privacy.</p>
<p class="indentt">There’s an old axiom that applies here: “If you aren’t paying for a product or service, then you are the product.” (For example, Facebook is “free,” but their product is your personal information, which they use for ad targeting.) With Gmail for work, you <em>are</em> paying, so you are <em>not</em> the product.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’d really rather use an alternate service (such as privacy-focused ProtonMail), the setup is going to end up being similar to what we cover here. This means that the steps discussed in this section will be useful in any case.</p>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec17_1_1">17.1.1 Google Workspace Signup</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before we start, a little caveat: Google changes their services all the time so you might need to use a heaping spoonful of technical sophistication (<a href="ch05.xhtml#box5_1">Box 5.1</a>). We visited the site one day to go through all the steps and create an account, and then the next day went back to double-check a step in the process only to find that the signup flow was entirely changed. They still wanted the same information—everything was just arranged totally differently! Then, shortly after, Google changed the name of its service from G Suite to Google Workspace… it’s just a mess.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_622"></span>To sign up for Google Workspace, head over to the Workspace home page (<a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/gmail/">https://workspace.google.com/products/gmail/</a>) and get started by clicking the Get Started button… or whatever the equivalent is today. Again, Google might be testing different language for buttons—who knows? Proceed through whatever random information they need from you to finish the account creation—the only important step is that when you are asked about your domain name, make sure to put in the domain you registered (without www e.g., <a href="http://codedangerously.com">codedangerously.com</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Now that the initial setup is done, Google will want you to make changes to your DNS records (<a href="ch16.xhtml#sec16_2">Section 16.2</a>) so that Google can verify that you actually own the domain and have added the correct records for setting up email (<a href="ch17.xhtml#sec17_2">Section 17.2</a>). That sounds more complicated than it is, but thankfully by now you are an expert at editing DNS records!</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 class="h3" id="sec17_2">17.2 MX Records</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this section, we’ll set up so-called <em>mail exchange</em> records, or MX records for short. The MX records for a domain are what associate the domain name with an email provider and allow the creation of custom addresses at the domain.</p>
<p class="indent">As mentioned in <a href="ch17.xhtml#sec17_1_1">Section 17.1.1</a>, Google wants to make sure that you are in fact the owner of the domain that you are trying to create an email account for, and luckily the DNS system provides a lot of opportunities to add information to a domain’s records. For Gmail, Google just wants you to add an extra TXT record (which is what it sounds like: a text record on your site’s DNS configuration) consisting of a unique string of letters and numbers.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the public nature of the DNS records, Google can just query your domain’s information and easily see that the verification strings match, confirming that you are in fact the person who controls the domain. If you haven’t already, click past the verification instructions welcome page to get to the details on how to make Google happy. Copy the verification text on the page (<a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig1">Figure 17.1</a>).</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_623"></span>In another tab or window, open up your site’s DNS records in Cloudflare, click the “Add record” button, and select <span class="green-d"><code><strong>TXT</strong></code></span> from the Type dropdown. In the Name field, add in an <span class="green-d"><code><strong>@</strong></code></span> sign, which is a shorthand way of saying use whatever the root domain is for this record. (In other words, for us <span class="green-d"><code><strong>@</strong></code></span> is the same as <span class="green-d"><code><strong>codedangerously.com</strong></code></span>.) Click into the Content field and paste in your verification text, as shown in <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig2">Figure 17.2</a>. After hitting the Save button, you should see the new record in the list. As a last step, delete any old MX records that are not pointing to the Google servers (a step mentioned briefly when discussing A records in <a href="ch16.xhtml#sec16_3_1">Section 16.3.1</a>).</p>

<figcaption>
<p class="title-f"><strong>Figure 17.2:</strong> Adding the new TXT record (still not our real verification key).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_624"></span>We are almost done, but we still need to add the actual DNS records that point to Google’s servers to handle email. Hop back over to your Google Workspace admin console tab and click the Verify My Domain button at the bottom of the page.<sup><a id="fn17_1a" href="ch17.xhtml#fn17_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="footnote"><a id="fn17_1" href="ch17.xhtml#fn17_1a">1</a>. If we weren’t using Cloudflare, the changes could theoretically take up to 72 hours to go into effect (<a href="ch16.xhtml#sec16_2_1">Section 16.2.1</a>)—which is all the more reason to use Cloudflare.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are working with any other people on your project, you can use the admin console setup process to add other users to your Google Workspace account. It is a pretty self-explanatory process, and if you don’t want to deal with it now, you don’t need to.</p>
<p class="indent">To get your email up and running, click the Activate link to bring up a page with instructions that show how to set up your DNS records so that email gets routed to the correct mail servers. In particular, we’ll be adding MX records to the DNS settings at Cloudflare. To add the first one, copy the first value from the Google Workspace setup, which for us is <span class="green-d"><code><strong>ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM</strong></code></span>. Then, on the Cloudflare DNS management page, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="number">
<li><p class="number">Add a new record, making sure that <span class="green-d"><code><strong>MX</strong></code></span> is selected in the Type dropdown.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">Add <span class="green-d"><code><strong>@</strong></code></span> in the Name field so that the record points to the domain root.</p></li>
<li><p class="number"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_625"></span>Add the server name that you copied from Google Workspace into the Mail server field.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">For this first record, set a priority of 1.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Now head back over to your Google Workspace setup tab, and then bounce back and forth between that and Cloudflare to finish entering the other MX records listed in the table, making sure that you are setting the priority on each one to the specified level (1, 5, or 10 from Google’s MX info).</p>
<p class="indent">When you are done, click the Activate Gmail button and let Google check to see if the DNS records have been correctly added. If they have been, that’s it—you are all done!</p>
<p class="indent">At this point, Google will (could… may… really, who knows?!) take you to a confirmation page to let you know that your Google Workspace account is set up. If you want to check out your new Gmail account, click the Google Apps menu icon at the top right, and then select Gmail (<a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig3">Figure 17.3</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_626"></span>In the future, you can access your new email inbox by going to <a href="http://mail.google.com">mail.google.com</a> and signing in with the new account that you created during the mail setup process. If you need to get back to the console and can’t remember what the address is, it’s super-easy: <a href="http://admin.google.com">admin.google.com</a>. Once you’ve logged in there, you can add additional users to your account, update billing information, or add additional services.</p>
<p class="indent">Speaking of additional services… since you have a Google account now, why not sign up for Google Analytics so that you can get information about who is visiting your site?</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="sec17_3">17.3 Site Analytics</h3>
<p class="noindent">Google Analytics is probably the most useful free service that Google has for the owners of websites and web applications. By adding just a tiny little snippet of code to your site, you can have Google track not just how many people are visiting your site, but also the browser and operating system they are using, whether they are on desktop or mobile, how they found your site, how long they stayed on your site, which pages they viewed, which page they left your site from… and a lot more.</p>
<p class="indent">To get started, visit the Google Analytics home page (<a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/">https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/</a>) and click the big Sign Up for Free button. (As always, use your technical sophistication (<a href="ch05.xhtml#box5_1">Box 5.1</a>) if Google has changed their interface since we wrote this.) From there, you’ll be asked to sign in using the Google account that you just created.</p>
<p class="indent">Once you are in, you’ll be on the Analytics setup track. Click the Get Started or Sign Up button to go to the site information page. Fill out the fields on the page with the requested information about your site, and then at the bottom of the page press the Get Tracking ID button.</p>
<p class="indent">After you agree to the Terms of Service, the site will take you to a page in your new analytics account that will have the little bit of code you need to add to your site for the tracking to work. What you are looking for is the code snippet that looks something like <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17list1">Listing 17.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">If you’ve looked for information on how to set up Analytics in the past, you might have seen someone suggest that you should put the Google Analytics code snippet at the very end of your site, right above the closing body tag <span class="green-d"><code><strong>&lt;/body&gt;</strong></code></span>. You can absolutely do that, and the analytics will still work, but the main reason for doing that has changed.</p>
<p class="indent">It used to be the case that when your site tried to load Analytics it would actually hold up the rest of your site from loading until the Analytics code finished downloading—not a good thing if the connection to Google is slow. Since then, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_629"></span>though, the Google Analytics code has switched to using an <em>asynchronous loading</em> method that makes it so that the rest of your site load isn’t held up.</p>
<p class="indent">Once you’re all set up, you can sign into the Analytics dashboard by going to <a href="http://analytics.google.com">analytics.google.com</a>.

<p class="indent">Google Analytics is a <em>really</em> deep service, and we aren’t going to dive into how to use it—that would require a book of its own (and there are many out there). This goal here was just to get you up and running with the service, and in the future we might write up an Analytics tutorial of our own. Until then, you’ll just need to search around the interwebs and find guides and tutorials to teach you the dark arts of Google Analytics.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="sec17_4">17.4 Conclusion</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_630"></span>So there you go! If you made it all the way through <a href="part03.xhtml#part03">Part III</a>, you now have your site running on a custom domain, you are using Cloudflare for DNS management, you have a custom email address through Google Workspace, and you are using Google Analytics to learn more about the people visiting your site. You’ve gone from just having a rinky-dink page on the Internet to actually looking like a legitimate homepage or business. Great work!</p>
<p class="indent">This final accomplishment also brings the full story arc of this tutorial to a close. You have now learned enough HTML, CSS and Layout to be <em>dangerous</em>. Congratulations!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a moment to reflect on just how far we’ve come in this book. We started <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a> of <a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a> assuming zero knowledge of HTML or CSS. We systematically built up our knowledge of HTML tags by filling in the index page (<a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>) and adding a couple more pages to our little site (<a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>). We then took our first steps into the world of web design with inline styles (<a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>), which led naturally into a study of CSS and layout (<a href="part02.xhtml#part02">Part II</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, we started with the bare-bones site shown in <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig6">Figure 17.6</a>. By writing good semantic markup (<a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>), using CSS values (<a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>), applying the box model (<a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>), and using a static site generator for proper DRY layout (<a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a> and <a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>) with flexbox (<a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>), we transformed that plain page into a fully developed website.</p>

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_631"></span>We added to that the beginnings of a blog (<a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a>), a mobile-friendly view (<a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>), and the little touches from <a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a>. We took a quick detour to learn the basics of grid (<a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a>), and then added the custom domain here in <a href="part03.xhtml#part03">Part III</a> (<a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a> and <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>). At this point, we’ve got a great foundation for a polished personal homepage or company website, featuring a blog and as many custom pages as we care to make, all running on a custom domain of our choosing.</p>
<p class="indent">To put it in more visual terms, the initial sample website looks like <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig7">Figure 17.7</a>; after completing this tutorial, it looks like <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig8">Figure 17.8</a>. Quite a difference!</p>

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_632"></span>Now that we’ve reached the end of <em>Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout to Be Dangerous</em>, let’s talk about next steps. As noted in <a href="ch05.xhtml#sec5_1">Section 5.1</a>, this is a front-end development tutorial, not a design tutorial per se, but it’s a tremendous head start for learning more about web design. It’s hard to give specific recommendations for next steps on this subject because everyone we know cobbles together their knowledge from here and there. Our best advice is to work on a project you care about, Google around to figure out how to do it (<a href="ch05.xhtml#box5_1">Box 5.1</a>), and keep practicing. That’s the only way to get better.</p>
<p class="indent">On the development side, there’s lots more to learn about Jekyll, including aspects of the system that are more closely related to full-strength web development (including more details on the <span class="green-d"><code><strong>Gemfile</strong></code></span>s mentioned in <a href="ch09.xhtml#sec9_2_1">Section 9.2.1</a>, additional command-line commands like <span class="green-d"><code><strong>jekyll new</strong></code></span>, etc.). The Jekyll documentation (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">https://jekyllrb.com/docs/</a>) is a good place to start.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, you now have the HTML and CSS knowledge (especially CSS classes and ids) needed to start learning <em>JavaScript</em>, the native programming language of web browsers. This is the subject of the next tutorial in the Learn Enough introductory <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_633"></span>sequence (<a href="https://www.learnenough.com/all-access">https://www.learnenough.com/all-access</a>), <em>Learn Enough JavaScript to Be Dangerous</em> (<a href="https://www.learnenough.com/javascript">https://www.learnenough.com/javascript</a>). After that, you’ll be ready to learn full-strength database-backed web development, via <em>Learn Enough Ruby to Be Dangerous</em> (<a href="https://www.learnenough.com/ruby">https://www.learnenough.com/ruby</a>) and the <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> (<a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">https://www.railstutorial.org/</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">We hope you’ve enjoyed <em>Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout to Be Dangerous</em>. Now get out there and start making things!<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_634"></span></p>
