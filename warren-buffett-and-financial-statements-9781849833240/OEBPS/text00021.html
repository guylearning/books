 hen a company sells an asset (other than inventory), the profit or loss for the sale is recorded under Gain (or Loss) on <span id="page_54" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="54"></span>
 Sale of Assets. The profit is the difference between the proceeds from the sale and the carrying amount shown on the company’s books. If the company had a building that it paid $1 million for, and after depreciating it down to $500,000, sold it for $800,000, the company would record a gain of $300,000 on the sale of the asset. Likewise, if the building sold for $400,000, the company would record a loss of $100,000.</p>
<p class="indent">The same thing applies to the entry “Other.” This is where non-operating, unusual, and infrequent income and expense events are netted out and entered onto the income statement. Such events would include the sale of fixed assets, such as property, plant, and equipment. Also included under “Other” would be licensing agreements and the sale of patents, if they were categorized as outside the normal course of business.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes these nonrecurring events can significantly add to a company’s bottom line. Since these <i>are</i>
 nonrecurring events, Warren believes that they should be removed from any calculation of the company’s net earnings in determining whether or not the company has a durable competitive advantage.</p>
