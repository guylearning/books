 his chapter concerns long-term debt that is coming due and has to be paid off in the current year. Long-term debt is not a yearly current liability for most businesses. However, a few very large corporations do have some portion of their long-term debt coming due on a yearly basis. Where it can <span id="page_114" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="114"></span>
 create problems is when some companies lump it in with short-term debt on the balance sheet, which creates the illusion that the company has more short-term debt than it really does.</p>
<p class="indent">As a rule, companies with a durable competitive advantage require little or no long-term debt to maintain their business operations, and therefore have little or no long-term debt ever coming due. So if we are dealing with a company that has a lot of long-term debt coming due, we probably aren’t dealing with a company that has a long-term competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">Any time we are buying into a company that has a durable competitive advantage but has been going through troubled times due to a one-time solvable event—like a subsidiary in a different business bleeding cash—it is best to check the horizon and see how much of the company’s long-term debt is due in the years ahead. Too much debt coming due in a single year can spook investors, which will give us a lower price to buy in at.</p>
<p class="indent">With a mediocre company that is experiencing serious problems, too much debt coming due in a current year can lead to cash flow problems and certain bankruptcy, which is also certain death to our investment.</p>
<p class="indent">And having dying investments is not how we get rich.</p>
