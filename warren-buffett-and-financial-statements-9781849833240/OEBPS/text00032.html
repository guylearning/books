 hen a company sells its products to a purchaser, it does so on the basis of either cash up front or payment due thirty days after the purchaser receives the goods. In some businesses the cash isn’t due for even longer periods. Sales in this state of limbo, where the cash is due, are called receivables. This is <span id="page_84" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="84"></span>
 money that is owed the company. Since a certain percentage of purchasers that were sold goods will not pay, an estimated amount for bad debts is deducted from the Receivables, which gives us Net Receivables.</p>
<p class="indent">Receivables less Bad Debts equals Net Receivables.</p>
<p class="indent">Net Receivables as a stand-alone number tells us very little about the company’s long-term competitive advantage. However, it does tell us a great deal about different companies within the same industry. In very competitive industries, some companies will attempt to gain an advantage by offering better payment terms—instead of 30 days, they may give vendors 120 days. This will cause an increase in sales and an increase in receivables.</p>
<p class="indent">If a company is consistently showing a lower percentage of Net Receivables to Gross Sales than its competitors, it usually has some kind of competitive advantage working in its favor that the others don’t have.</p>
