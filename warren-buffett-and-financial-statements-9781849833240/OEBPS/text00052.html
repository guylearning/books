 hen a company buys back its own shares, it can do two things with them. It can cancel them or it can retain them with the possibility of reissuing them later on. If it cancels them the shares cease to exist. But if it keeps them, with the possibility of reissuing them later on, they are carried on the balance sheet under shareholders’ equity as treasury stock. Shares held as treasury stock have no voting rights, nor do they receive dividends and, though arguably an asset, they are carried on the balance sheet at a negative value because they represent a reduction in the shareholders’ equity.</p>
<p class="indent">Companies with a durable competitive advantage, because of their great economics, tend to have lots of free cash that they can spend on buying back their shares. Thus one of the hallmarks of a company with a durable competitive advantage is the presence of treasury shares on the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a several other financial dynamics to be aware of regarding treasury shares. One is that when a company buys its own shares, and holds them as treasury stock, it is effectively decreasing the company’s equity, which increases the company’s return on shareholders’ equity. Since a high return on shareholders’ equity is one sign of a durable competitive advantage, it is good to know if the high returns on equity are being generated by financial engineering or exceptional business economics or because of a combination of the two. <span id="page_138" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="138"></span>
 To see which is which, convert the negative value of the treasury shares into a positive number and add it to the shareholders’ equity instead of subtracting it. Then divide the company’s net earnings by the new total shareholders’ equity. This will give us the company’s return on equity minus the effects of financial engineering.</p>
<p class="indent">Also, in the United States, in determining whether or not the personal holding company tax applies, treasury shares are not part of the pool of the outstanding shares, when it comes to determining control of the company. Unscrupulous types will represent to the IRS that they only own 49% of all outstanding shares. But if they subtract the treasury shares, as the law says they should, they really control in excess of 50%, which gives them control of the business and potentially makes them liable to the personal holding company tax.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us leave this chapter with a simple rule: The presence of treasury shares on the balance sheet, and a history of buying back shares, are good indicators that the company in question has a durable competitive advantage working in its favor.</p>
