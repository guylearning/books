 y dividing Total Current Assets by Total Current Liabilities, one can determine the liquidity of the company—the higher the current ratio, the more liquid the company is, and the greater its ability to pay current liabilities when they come due. A current ratio of over one is considered good, and anything below one, bad. If it is below one, it is thought that the <span id="page_116" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="116"></span>
 company might have a hard time meeting its short-term obligations to its creditors. But, as we discussed in Chapter 28, companies with a durable competitive advantage often have current ratios under one. What causes this anomaly is the immense earning power the durable competitive advantage creates. In short, you have a current economic picture that doesn’t require the “liquidity cushion” that a company with poorer economics needs. (For a more in-depth discussion, please refer back to Chapter 28.) While the current ratio is of great importance in determining the liquidity of a marginal-to-average business, it is of little use in telling us whether or not a company has a durable competitive advantage.</p>
