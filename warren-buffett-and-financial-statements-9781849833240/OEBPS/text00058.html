 apital expenditures are outlays of cash or the equivalent in assets that are more permanent in nature—held longer than a year—such as property, plant, and equipment. They also include expenditures for such intangibles as patents. Basically they are assets that are expensed over a period of time greater <span id="page_153" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="153"></span>
 than a year through depreciation or amortization. Capital expenditures are recorded on the cash flow statement under investment operations.</p>
<p class="indent">Buying a new truck for your company is a capital expenditure, the value of the truck will be expensed through depreciation over its life—let’s say six years. But the gasoline used in the truck is a current expense, with the full price deducted from income during the current year.</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to making capital expenditures, not all companies are created equal. Many companies must make huge capital expenditures just to stay in business. If capital expenditures remain high over a number of years, they can start to have deep impact on earnings. Warren has said that this is the reason that he never invested in telephone companies—the tremendous capital outlays in building out communication networks greatly hamper their long-term economics.</p>
<p class="indent">As a rule, a company with a durable competitive advantage uses a smaller portion of its earnings for capital expenditures for continuing operations than do those without a competitive advantage. Let’s look at a couple of examples.</p>
<p class="indent">Coca-Cola, a long-time Warren favorite, over the last ten years earned a total $20.21 per share while only using $4.01 per share, or 19% of its total earnings, for capital expenditures for the same time period. Moody’s, a company Warren has identified as having a durable competitive advantage, earned $14.24 a share over the last ten years while using a <span id="page_154" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="154"></span>
 minuscule $0.84 a share, or 5% of its total earnings, for capital expenditures.</p>
<p class="indent">Compare Coke and Moody’s with GM, which over the last ten years earned a total $31.64 a share after subtracting losses, while burning through a whopping $140.42 a share in capital expenditures. Or tiremaker Goodyear, which over the last ten years earned a total of $3.67 a share after subtracting losses and had total capital expenditures of $34.88 a share.</p>
<p class="indent">If GM used 444% more for capital expenditures than it earned, and Goodyear used 950%, where did all that extra money come from? It came from bank loans and from selling tons of new debt to the public. Such actions add more debt to these companies’ balance sheets, which increases the amount of money they spend on interest payments, which is never a good thing.</p>
<p class="indent">Both Coke and Moody’s, however, have enough excess income to have stock buyback programs that reduce the number of shares outstanding, while at the same time either reducing long-term debt or keeping it low. Both actions are big positives to Warren, and both helped him identify Coca-Cola and Moody’s as businesses with a durable competitive advantage working in their favor.</p>
<p class="indent">When we look at capital expenditures in relation to net earnings we simply add up a company’s total capital expenditures for a ten-year period and compare the figure with the company’s total net earnings for the same ten-year period. The <span id="page_155" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="155"></span>
 reason we look at a ten-year period is that it gives us a really good long-term perspective as to what is going on with the business.</p>
<p class="indent">Historically, durable competitive advantage companies used a far smaller percentage of their net income for capital expenditures. For instance, Wrigley annually uses approximately 49% of its net earnings for capital expenditures. Altria uses approximately 20%; Procter &amp; Gamble, 28%; Pepsico, 36%; American Express, 23%; Coca-Cola, 19%; and Moody’s, 5%.</p>
<p class="indent">Warren has discovered that if a company is historically using 50% or less of its annual net earnings for capital expenditures, it is a good place to look for a durable competitive advantage. If it is consistently using less than 25% of its net earnings for capital expenditures, that scenario occurs more than likely because the company has a durable competitive advantage working in its favor.</p>
<p class="indent">And having a durable competitive advantage working in our favor is what it is all about.</p>
