 his is where all the goodies are kept: the cash, the plant and equipment, the patents, and all the stuff that riches are made of. They are found on the company’s balance sheet under the heading Assets.</p>
<p class="indent">On the balance sheet, accounting types long ago divided Corporate Assets into two distinct groups: Current Assets, and All Other Assets.</p>
<p class="indent">Current Assets is made up of “cash and cash equivalents,” “short-term investments,” “net receivables,” “inventory,” and a general slush fund called “other assets.” These are called current assets because they are cash, or they can be or will be converted into cash in a very short period of time (usually within a year). As a rule, they are listed on the balance sheet in order of their liquidity (which means how quickly they can be turned into cash). Historically, current assets have also been called quick, liquid, or floating assets. What is important about them is their availability to be turned into cash and spent should the business economics of the enterprise start to erode and other sources of day-to-day operating capital start to evaporate. (If you can’t imagine sources of operating capital evaporating overnight, just think Bear Stearns.)</p>
<p class="indent">All other assets are those that aren’t current, which means that they will not or cannot be converted into cash in the year ahead; they are listed in a separate category immediately under <span id="page_74" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="74"></span>
 Current Assets. In this category go Long-Term Investments, Property Plant and Equipment, Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Accumulated Amortization, Other Assets, and Deferred Long-Term Asset Charges.</p>
<p class="indent">Collectively these two groups of assets make up the company’s total assets. Individually and collectively, via their quality and quantity, they tell Warren a great many things about the economic character of a business and whether or not it possesses the coveted durable competitive advantage that will make him superrich.</p>
<p class="indent">This is why we are going to spend the next couple of chapters discussing the individual asset classes and how Warren uses them to identify a company with the durable competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">So let’s take a look at the categories and see how we can use them individually and collectively to help us identify the exceptional business with a long-term competitive advantage working in its favor.</p>
