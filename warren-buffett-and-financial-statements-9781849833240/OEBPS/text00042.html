 ccounts payable is money owed to suppliers that have provided goods and services to the company on credit. We order 1,000 pounds of coffee, and they send it to us along with a bill/invoice. The bill/invoice for the 1,000 pounds of coffee is an account payable.</p>
<p class="indent">Accrued expenses are liabilities that the company has <span id="page_108" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="108"></span>
 incurred, but has yet to be invoiced for. These expenses include sales tax payable, wages payable, and accrued rent payable. We hire someone and tell him that we will pay him at the end of the month; each day that he works ’til the end of the month is booked as an accrued expense.</p>
<p class="indent">Other debts is a slush fund for all short-term debts that didn’t qualify to be included in any of the above categories.</p>
<p class="indent">Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Other Debts can tell us a lot about the current situation of a business, but as stand-alone entries they tell us little about the long-term economic nature of the business and whether or not it has a durable competitive advantage. However, the amount of short- and long-term debt that a company carries can tell a great deal about the long-term economics of a business and whether or not it has a durable competitive advantage.</p>
