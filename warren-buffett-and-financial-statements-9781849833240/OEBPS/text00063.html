 s stated earlier, in 1987 Warren started buying shares in Coca-Cola for an average price of $6.50 a share against pretax earnings of $.70 a share; this equates to after-tax earnings of $.46 a share. Historically, Coca-Cola’s earnings had been growing at an annual rate of around 10%.</p>
<p class="indent">Seeing this, Warren could argue that he had just bought a Coca-Cola equity bond paying an initial pretax interest rate of 10.7% on his $6.50 investment. He could also argue that that pretax yield would increase over time at a projected annual rate of 10% (Coca-Cola’s average annual rate of earnings growth for the ten years prior to 1987).</p>
<p class="indent">If, in 1987, he had projected out the earnings growth of 10% forward, he could have argued that by 2007 Coca-Cola would have pretax per-share earnings of $4.35 and after-tax earnings of $2.82 a share. This would mean that by 2007 his <span id="page_169" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="169"></span>
 pretax return on his Coca-Cola equity bonds would grow to 66%, which equates to an after-tax return of 43%.</p>
<p class="indent">So what was a pretax 66% return on a $6.50 equity bond in 2007 worth in 1987? It depends on the discount rate that we use. If we use 7%, which is right about what long-term rates were back then, we get a discounted back value of approximately 17%. Multiply 17% by the $6.50 a share he was paying for and we would get $1.10 a share. Multiply $1.10 by Coca-Cola’s 1987 P/E of 14 and we get $15.40 per share. Thus Warren could have argued in 1987 that he was buying an equity bond for $6.50 a share, and that if he held it for twenty years, its 1987 intrinsic value really would be $15.40 a share.</p>
<p class="indent">By 2007 Coca-Cola’s pretax earnings had grown at an annual rate of 9.35% to $3.96 a share, which equates to an after-tax $2.57 a share. This means that Warren can argue that his Coca-Cola equity bonds are now paying him a pretax return of $3.96 a share on his original investment of $6.50 a share, which equates to a current pretax yield of 60% and an after-tax yield of 40%.</p>
<p class="indent">The stock market in 2007 valued Warren’s equity bonds at between $45 and $64 a share. In 2007 Coca-Cola earned a pretax $3.96 per equity bond/share, which equated to an after-tax $2.57 per equity bond/share. Capitalized at the 2007 corporate interest rate of 6.5%, Coca-Cola’s pretax earnings of $3.96 a share are worth approximately $60 per equity <span id="page_170" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="170"></span>
 bond/share ($3.96 ÷ .065 = $60). This is in line with the 2007 stock market value at between $45 and $64 a share.</p>
<p class="indent">With the market valuing Warren’s Coca-Cola equity bonds at $64 a share in 2007, Warren could calculate that he has been earning a tax-deferred annual compounding rate of return of 12.11% on his original investment. Think of it as a bond that paid an annual rate of return of 12.11% without tax on the interest earned. Not only that: You got to reinvest all those interest payments in more bonds that were paying 12.11%. Yes, someday you will have to pay taxes when you sell your equity bonds, but if you don’t sell them you just keep on earning 12.11% free of taxes year after year after year.…</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t believe it? Consider this: Warren has approximately $64 billion in capital gains on his Berkshire stock and has yet to pay a penny in taxes on it. The greatest accumulation of private wealth in the history of the world and not a penny paid to the taxman.</p>
<p class="indent">Does it get any better?</p>
