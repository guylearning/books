 usinesses sometimes pay for goods and services that they will receive in the near future, although they have not yet taken possession of the goods or received the benefits of the service. Even though the goods or services have not been <span id="page_86" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="86"></span>
 received, they are paid for, so they are assets of the business. They are noted as current assets in the account for prepaid expenses. Insurance premiums for the year ahead, which are paid in advance, would be one such prepaid expense. Prepaid expenses offer us little information about the nature of the business, or about whether it is benefiting from having a durable competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">Other current assets are non-cash assets that are due within the year but are not as yet in the company’s hands. These include such things as deferred income tax recoveries, which are due within the year, but aren’t cash in hand just yet.</p>
