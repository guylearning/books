 hort-term debt is money that is owed by the corporation and due within the year. This includes commercial paper and short-term bank loans. Short-term money historically has been cheaper than long-term money. This means that it is possible <span id="page_110" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="110"></span>
 to make money borrowing short-term and lending it long-term. We borrow short-term money at 5% and lend it long-term for 7%—sounds easy enough. But the problem with this strategy is that the money we borrowed is short-term money. That means that we have to pay it back within the year, which is easy enough to do—we just borrow more money short-term to pay back the short-term debt that is coming due. In the financial world, this is called “rolling over the debt.” And it all works well until short-term rates jump above what we lent the money long at, which was 7%. Sure, it seemed like a great idea when short-term rates were 5%, but now that they have jumped to 8%, we have to refinance our short-term debt at a rate in excess of what we loaned it out at. And that does not make us happy.</p>
<p class="indent">Another part of the short-term borrowing disaster equation is what happens if we lend all this money long-term, but our creditors decide not to loan us any more money short-term. Suddenly we have to pay back all that money we borrowed short-term and lent long-term. But we don’t have it, because we lent it long-term, which means that we won’t get paid back for many, many years.</p>
<p class="indent">This is what happened to Bear Stearns: They borrowed short-term and bought mortgage-backed securities, using the mortgage-backed securities as collateral for the short-term loans. But one day their creditors woke up and said, “We don’t think the collateral is worth what you guys told us it was <span id="page_111" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="111"></span>
 worth, so we don’t want to lend you any more money and we want to collect the money we did loan you.” Not a good position for Bear Stearns to be in.</p>
<p class="indent">The smartest and safest way to make money in banking is to borrow it long-term and lend it long-term. That’s why banks are always trying to lock us into those five- and ten-year CDs. It is not the fast and easy money of borrowing short-term and lending it long, but it is a saner and far more conservative way to make money. Which is what we want in a bank and a banker—sanity.</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to investing in financial institutions Warren has always shied away from companies that are bigger borrowers of short-term money than of long-term money. Warren’s favorite, Wells Fargo, has 57 cents of short-term debt for every dollar of long-term debt. But an aggressive bank, like Bank of America N.A., has $2.09 of short-term debt for every dollar of long-term debt. And while being aggressive can mean making lots of money over the short-term, it has often led to financial disasters over the long-term. And one never gets rich being on the downside of a financial disaster.</p>
<p class="indent">In troubled financial times it is the stable conservative banks like Wells Fargo that have the competitive advantage over the go-go aggressive banks that have gotten themselves into trouble. The “durability” equates with the stability that comes with being conservative. It has money when the others have losses, which creates opportunity. Aggressive borrowers <span id="page_112" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="112"></span>
 of short-term money are often at the mercy of sudden shifts in the credit markets, which puts their entire operation at risk and equates with a loss of any kind of durability in their business model. And in the business world durability of a competitive advantage is a lot like virginity—easier to protect than it is to get back.</p>
