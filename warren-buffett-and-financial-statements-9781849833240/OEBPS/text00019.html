 ll machinery and buildings eventually wear out over time; this wearing out is recognized on the income statement as depreciation. Basically, the amount that something <span id="page_46" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="46"></span>
 depreciates in a given year is a cost that is allocated against income for that year. This makes sense: The amount by which the asset depreciated can arguably be said to have been used in the company’s business activity of the year that generated the income.</p>
<p class="indent">An example: Imagine that a million-dollar printing press is bought by XYZ Printing Corporation. This printing press has a life span of ten years. Because it has a life span of ten years, the Internal Revenue Service will not let the company expense the entire $1 million cost in the year that it was purchased. Instead, the press must be expensed over the ten years that it is in service. A ten-year life span and an original cost of $1 million will mean that XYZ will depreciate the printing press at a rate of $100,000 a year. Depreciation is a real cost of doing business, because at some time in the future, the printing press will have to be replaced.</p>
<p class="indent">The buying of the printing press will—on the balance sheet—cause $1 million to come out of cash and $1 million to be added to plant and equipment. Then, for the next ten years, the depreciated cost of $100,000 a year will show up on the income statement as an expense. On the balance sheet each year, $100,000 will be subtracted from the plant and equipment asset account and $100,000 added to the accumulated depreciation liability account. The actual $1 million cash outlay for the printing press will show up on the cash flow statement under capital expenditures. We would like to emphasize that the million-dollar expense for the printing press is not <span id="page_47" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="47"></span>
 taken in the year that it is bought; rather it is allocated as a depreciation expense to the income statement, in $100,000 increments, over a ten-year period.</p>
<p class="indent">A neat trick that Wall Street financial types have figured out is that once the printing press is bought and paid for, the $100,000 yearly depreciation expense doesn’t take any more additional cash outlays, but it does decrease earnings that are reported to the IRS every year for the next ten years. This means that, from a short-term perspective, XYZ has a yearly cost that in reality isn’t costing it any additional outlays of cash. Thus, the Wall Street financial types can add that $100,000 cost back into earnings, which means that the cash flow of the business can now support more debt for such fun money-making ventures as leveraged buyouts. Wall Street has an acronym for this earnings recalculation: They call it EBITDA—meaning Earnings Before Income Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization.</p>
<p class="indent">Warren says that by using EBITDA our clever Wall Street types are ignoring that eventually the printing press will wear out and the company will have to come up with another $1 million to buy a new one. But now the company is saddled with a ton of debt left over from the leveraged buyout and might not have the ability to finance the $1 million purchase of a new printing press.</p>
<p class="indent">Warren believes that depreciation is a very real expense and should always be included in any calculation of earnings. <span id="page_48" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="48"></span>
 To do otherwise would be to delude ourselves over the short-term into believing that business is earning more than it actually is. And one does not get rich off delusions.</p>
<p class="indent">What Warren has discovered is that companies that have a durable competitive advantage tend to have lower depreciation costs as a percentage of gross profit than companies that have to suffer the woes of intense competition. As an example, Coca-Cola’s depreciation expense consistently runs about 6% of its gross profits, and Wrigley’s, another durable competitive advantage holder, also runs around 7%. And Procter &amp; Gamble, another long-time Warren favorite, comes in at approximately 8%. Contrast the case of GM, which is in a highly competitive capital-intensive business. Its depreciation expense runs anywhere from 22% to 57% of its gross profits.</p>
<p class="indent">As with any expense that eats into a company’s gross profits, Warren has found that less always means more—when it comes to increasing the bottom line.</p>
