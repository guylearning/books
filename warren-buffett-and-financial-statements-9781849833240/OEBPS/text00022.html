 subtracted. It is also the number that Warren uses when he is calculating the return that he is getting when he buys a whole business, or when he buys a partial interest in a company through the open-market purchase of its shares.</p>
<p class="indent">With the exception of tax-free investments, all investment returns are marketed on a pre-tax basis. And since all investments compete with each other, it is easier to think about them if they are thought about in equal terms.</p>
<p class="indent">When Warren bought $139 million worth of tax-free bonds in Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS), which paid him $22.7 million a year in tax-free interest, he reasoned that an after-tax $22 million was the same as earning a pre-tax $45 million. To buy a business that would earn him a pre-tax $45 million would cost him $250 million to $300 million. Thus, he viewed the WPPSS bonds as a business that he was buying at a 50% discount, relative to the value of what other businesses with similar economics were selling for.</p>
<p class="indent">Warren has always discussed the earnings of a company in pre-tax terms. This enables him to think about a business or investment in terms relative to other investments. It is also one of the cornerstones of his revelation that a company with a durable competitive advantage is actually a kind of “equity bond,” with an expanding coupon or interest rate. We shall explore his “equity bond” theory in much greater detail toward the end of the book.</p>
