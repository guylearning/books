<b>AAA rating:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">The highest rating that Standard &amp; Poor’s gives to a company for its financial soundness.<p class="gind">

<b>accounts receivable:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">Money owed to the company for goods sold that haven’t been paid for yet.<p class="gind">

<b>accumulated depreciation:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">The total of all depreciation, or decreases in value, that has been charged against an asset.<p class="gind">
<i>Accountants like to keep track of everything, including how much things depreciate. Think of accumulated depreciation as a very large trash can you can check to find how much the company’s assets have depreciated.</i>
</p>
</dd>
<dt role="term" class="gterm">
<b>amortization:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">Basically, the same as depreciation, but it applies to intangible assets such as goodwill and patents.<p class="gind">
<i>Depreciation applies to tangible assets such as a manufacturing plant. The problem with patents, for example, is that they <span id="page_182" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="182"></span>
 don’t really depreciate, so the cost of the patent is spread out (amortized) over a number of years as a cost.</i>

<b>asset:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">Something that is owned by the business and is expected to be used to generate future income.<p class="gind">

<b>balance sheet:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">A summary of a company’s assets, liabilities, and ownership equity as of a specific date, such as the end of its fiscal year.<p class="gind">
<i>A balance sheet is often described as a snapshot of a company’s financial condition on a single day within the year. There is no such thing as a balance sheet for a longer period of time. A balance sheet tells you how much you have and how much you owe. Subtract one from the other and you get how much you are worth.</i>
</p>
</dd>
<dt role="term" class="gterm">
<b>bond:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">A security that represents long-term debt.<p class="gind">
<i>Companies with durable competitive advantages don’t have a lot of bonds because they usually don’t have a lot of debt. And not having a lot of debt is a good thing.</i>
</p>
</dd>
<dt role="term" class="gterm">
<b>book value:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">All of the company’s assets minus all of the company’s liabilities. Divide this by the number of common shares outstanding, and you get the per-share book value of the company.<p class="gind">

<i>Warren got rich by buying the common stock of companies.</i>

</dd>
<dt role="term" class="gterm">
<b>competitive advantage:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">An edge over competitors that allows the company to make more money.<p class="gind">

<dt role="term" class="gterm">
<b>current ratio:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">The ratio of current assets to current liabilities.<p class="gind">

</p>
</dd>
<dt role="term" class="gterm">
<b>depreciation:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">Tangible assets wear out as they are used. As they wear out, a depreciation charge is taken against the asset.</dd>

<b>durable competitive advantage:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">A competitive advantage over a company’s competitors that it can maintain for a long period of time.<p class="gind">

<b>EBITDA:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.<p class="gind">
<i>Companies that don’t make money love EBITDA. Warren thinks that EBITDA is stupid. Whenever you hear management talking in terms of EBITDA, it means that they don’t have a durable competitive advantage.</i>

</dd>
<dt role="term" class="gterm">
<b>gross margin:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">The ratio of total profit to sales.<p class="gind">

</p>
</dd>
<dt role="term" class="gterm">
<b>gross profit:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">Proceeds on product sales. Sales minus cost of goods sold equals gross profit.<p class="gind">

<b>income statement:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">The statement that shows a company’s income and expenses for a specific period.<p class="gind">

</p>
</dd>
<dt role="term" class="gterm">
<b>intangible assets:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">Assets such as patents and copyrights, which can’t be physically touched, but can generate income.<p class="gind">
<i>Think of these as monopolies protected by law, which is a <span id="page_186" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="186"></span>
 kind of durable competitive advantage. The only problem with patents is that they eventually expire, or lose their protection. When this happens, any and every company in the world can produce the product and the company loses the competitive advantage the patent once provided. This is the reason why Warren has historically stayed away from the drug manufacturers.</i>
</p>
</dd>
<dt role="term" class="gterm">
<b>interest expense:</b>
</dt>
<dd role="definition" class="gdef">The amount of money a company pays in interest on both its long- and short-term debt.<p class="gind">
<i>Companies without a durable competitive advantage tend to have a lot of interest expense because they have a lot of debt. Companies with a durable competitive advantage tend not to have any debt so they have little or no interest expense.</i>

<i>A dramatic increase in the number of shares outstanding over a number of years without an increase in the company’s earnings usually means that the company is selling new shares to increase its capital base to make up for the fact that it is a mediocre business.
