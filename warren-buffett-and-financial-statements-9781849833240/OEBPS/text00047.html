 eferred Income Tax is tax that is due but hasn’t been paid. This figure tells us little about whether or not the company has a durable competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">The Minority Interest entry on a balance sheet is far more interesting. When the company acquires the stock of another, <span id="page_121" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="121"></span>
 it books the price it paid for the stock as an asset under “long-term investments.” But when it acquires more than 80% of the stock of a company, it can shift the acquired company’s entire balance sheet onto its balance sheet. The same with the income statement. An example: Berkshire’s acquisition of 90% of the Nebraska Furniture Mart. Because it acquired more than 80% of the NFM, Berkshire could book 100% of NFM’s income onto Berkshire’s income statement, and it could add 100% of NFM’s assets and liabilities to its balance sheet. What the Minority Interest entry represents is the value of the 10% of NFM that Berkshire does not own. This shows up as a liability to balance the equation, since Berkshire booked 100% of NFM’s assets and liabilities, even though it owns only 90% of NFM. So what does this have to do with identifying a company with a durable competitive advantage? Not much, but it is interesting to know what matters and what doesn’t in our search for the company with a durable competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">“Other Liabilities” is a catchall category into which businesses pool their miscellaneous debt. It includes such liabilities as judgments against the company, non-current benefits, interest on tax liabilities, unpaid fines, and derivative instruments. None of these helps us in our search for the durable competitive advantage.</p>
