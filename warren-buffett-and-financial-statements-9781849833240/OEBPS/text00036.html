 hen Exxon buys XYZ oil company and Exxon pays a price in excess of XYZ’s book value, the excess is recorded on Exxon’s balance sheet under the heading of Goodwill. Buy a lot of companies for a price in excess of their book <span id="page_95" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="95"></span>
 value, and we end up with a lot of goodwill on our balance sheet.</p>
<p class="indent">Goodwill used to be written off against the earnings of the business through a process of amortization, which caused a yearly charge against earnings on the income statement under the title of amortization of goodwill. In the modern age, the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) decided that goodwill wouldn’t have to be amortized unless the company that the goodwill was attached to was actually depreciating in value.</p>
<p class="indent">Whenever we see an increase in goodwill of a company over a number of years, we can assume that it is because the company is out buying other businesses. This can be a good thing if the company is buying businesses that also have a durable competitive advantage. If the goodwill account stays the same year after year, that is because either the company is paying under book value for a business or the company isn’t making any acquisitions.</p>
<p class="indent">Businesses that benefit from some kind of durable competitive advantage almost never sell for below their book value. We say almost never, but occasionally it does happen, and when it does, it can be the buying opportunity of a lifetime.</p>
