 his is an asset account on a company’s balance sheet, where the value of long-term investments (longer than a year), <span id="page_100" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="100"></span>
 such as stocks, bonds, and real estate is recorded. This account includes investments in the company’s affiliates and subsidiaries. What is interesting about the long-term investment account is that this asset class is carried on the books at their cost or market price, whichever is lower. But it cannot be marked to a price above cost even if the investments have appreciated in value. This means that a company can have a very valuable asset that it is carrying on its books at a valuation considerably below its market price.</p>
<p class="indent">A company’s long-term investments can tell us a lot about the investment mind-set of top management. Do they invest in other businesses that have durable competitive advantages, or do they invest in businesses that are in highly competitive markets? Sometimes we see the management of a wonderful business making huge investments in mediocre businesses for no other reason than they think big is better. Sometimes we see some enlightened manager of a mediocre business making investments in companies that have a durable competitive advantage. This is how Warren built his holding company Berkshire Hathaway into the empire that it is today. Berkshire was once-upon-a-time a mediocre business in the highly competitive textile industry. Warren bought a controlling interest, stopped paying the dividend so cash would accumulate, and then took the company’s working capital and went and bought an insurance company. Then he took the assets of the <span id="page_101" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="101"></span>
 insurance company and went on a forty-year shopping spree for companies with a durable competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">Kiss even a frog of a business enough times with a durable competitive advantage and it will turn into a prince of a business.</p>
<p class="indent">Or, as in Warren’s case, $60 billion, which is what his stock in Berkshire is now worth.</p>
