 hareholders’ equity is equal to the company’s total assets minus its total liabilities. That happens to equal the total sums of preferred and common stock, plus paid in capital, plus retained earnings, less treasury stock.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_140" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="140"></span>
 Shareholders’ equity has three sources. One is the capital that was originally raised selling preferred and common stock to the public. The second is any later sales of preferred and common stock to the public after the company is up and running. The third, and most important to us, is the accumulation of retained earnings.</p>
<p class="indent">Since all equity belongs to the company, and since the company belongs to the common shareholders, the equity really belongs to the common shareholders, which is why it is called shareholders’ equity.</p>
<p class="indent">Now if we are shareholders in a company, we would be very interested in how good a job management does at allocating our money, so we can earn even more. If they are bad at it we won’t be very happy and might even sell our shares and put our money elsewhere. But if they are really good at it we might even buy more of the company, along with everyone else who is impressed with management’s ability to profitably put shareholders’ equity to good use. To this end, financial analysts developed the return on shareholders’ equity equation to test management’s efficiency in allocating the shareholders’ money. This is an equation that Warren puts great stock in, in his search for the company with a durable competitive advantage, and it is the topic of our next chapter.</p>
