 company’s property, its manufacturing plant and equipment, and their collective value are carried on the balance <span id="page_91" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="91"></span>
 sheet as an asset. They are carried at their original cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is what occurs as the plant and equipment wear out little by little; every year, a charge is taken against the plant and equipment.</p>
<p class="indent">Companies that don’t have a long-term competitive advantage are faced with constant competition, which means they constantly have to update their manufacturing facilities to try to stay competitive, often before such equipment is worn out. This, of course, creates an ongoing expense that is often quite substantial, and keeps adding to the amount of plant and equipment the company lists on its balance sheet.</p>
<p class="indent">A company that has a durable competitive advantage doesn’t need to constantly upgrade its plant and equipment to stay competitive. Take the brand name gum manufacturer Wrigley. It builds a plant that makes chewing gum, and it doesn’t have to update the plant and equipment until they wear out.</p>
<p class="indent">So the company that has a durable competitive advantage replaces its plant and equipment as they wear out, while the company that doesn’t have a durable competitive advantage has to replace its plant and equipment to keep pace with the competition.</p>
<p class="indent">A company with a durable competitive advantage will be able to finance any new plants and equipment internally. But a company that doesn’t have a competitive advantage will be forced to turn to debt to finance its constant need to retool its plants to keep up with the competition.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_92" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="92"></span>
 We see this when we take a company with a long-term competitive advantage like Wrigley, which has plant and equipment worth $1.4 billion, carries $1 billion in debt, and earns in the neighborhood of $500 million per year. Compare Wrigley with a company without a durable competitive advantage, like GM, which has plant and equipment valued at $56 billion, carries $40 billion in debt, and has lost money for the last two years.</p>
<p class="indent">Chewing gum is not a product that changes much, and Wrigley’s brand name ensures a competitive advantage over its rivals. But GM must compete head-on with every car manufacturer on the planet, and its product mix constantly has to be upgraded and redesigned to stay ahead of the competition. This means that GM’s plants have to regularly be retooled to produce the new products.</p>
<p class="indent">Making chewing gum is a much better and a far more profitable business for shareholders than making cars. Consider this: $100,000 invested in Wrigley back in 1990 would be worth approximately $547,000 in 2008. But $100,000 invested in GM back in 1990 would be worth approximately $97,000 in 2008. This equates to a difference of $460,000 in Wrigley’s shareholders’ favor. They have happily chewed their way to riches, while GM’s shareholders have watched their fortunes drive off a cliff.</p>
<p class="indent">As Warren says, producing a consistent product that doesn’t have to change equates to consistent profits. The <span id="page_93" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="93"></span>
 consistent product means there is no need to spend tons of money upgrading the plant and equipment just to stay competitive, which frees up tons of money for other money-making ventures. To get rich, we first have to make money, and it helps if we make lots of money. One of the ways to make lots of money is not having to spend a ton of money keeping up with the Joneses.</p>
