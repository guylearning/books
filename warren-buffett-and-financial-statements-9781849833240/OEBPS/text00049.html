 hen you subtract all your liabilities from all your assets you get your net worth. If you take a company’s total assets <span id="page_127" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="127"></span>

This is the amount of money that the company’s owners/shareholders have initially put in and have left in the business to keep it running. Shareholders’ Equity is accounted for under the headings of Capital Stock, which includes Preferred and Common Stock; Paid in Capital, and Retained Earnings. Add together Total Liabilities and Total Shareholders’ Equity and you get a sum that should equal Total Assets, which is why it is called a balance sheet—both sides balance.</p>
