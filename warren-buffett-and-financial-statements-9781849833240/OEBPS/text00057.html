 ost companies use what is called an Accrual Method of accounting, as opposed to a Cash Method. With the Accrual Method sales are booked when the goods go out the door, even if the buyer takes years to pay for them. With a Cash Method sales are only booked when the cash comes in. Because almost all businesses extend some kind of credit to their buyers, companies have found it more advantageous to use the Accrual Method, which allows them to book the sales on credit as income under accounts receivable on the income statement.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the Accrual Method of accounting allows credit sales to be booked as revenue it has become necessary for companies to keep separate track of the actual cash that flows in and out of the business. To this end, accountants created the cash flow statement.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_148" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="148"></span>
 A company can have a lot of cash coming in through the sale of shares or bonds and still not be profitable. (Similarly, a company can be profitable with a lot of sales on credit and not a lot of cash coming in.) The cash flow statement will tell us only if the company is bringing in more cash than it is spending (“positive cash flow”) or if it is spending more cash than it is bringing in (“negative cash flow”).</p>
<p class="indent">Cash flow statements are like income statements in that they always cover a set period of time. Company accountants generate one every three months and for the fiscal year.</p>
<p class="indent">The cash flow statement breaks down into three sections:</p>
<p class="indent">First, there is cash flow from operating activities: This area starts with net income and then adds back in depreciation and amortization. Though these are real expenses from an accounting point of view, they don’t eat up any cash, because they represent cash that was eaten up years ago. What we end up with is Total Cash from Operating Activities.</p>

<p class="indent"><span id="page_149" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="149"></span>
 Next is cash flow from investing operations: This area includes an entry for all capital expenditures made for that accounting period. Capital expenditures is always a negative number because it’s an expenditure, which causes a depletion of cash.</p>
<p class="indent">Also included in this category is Total Other Investing Cash Flow Items, which adds up all the cash that gets expended and brought in from the buying and selling of income-producing assets. If more cash is expended than is brought in, it is a negative number. If more cash is brought in than is expended, it is a positive number.</p>
<p class="indent">Both of these entries are added together to give us Total Cash from Investing Activities.</p>

<td class="line30">

</td>

</table>
</div>
<p class="indent">Finally, there is the section on cash flow from financing activities: This measures the cash that flows in and out of a company because of financing activities. This includes all outflows of cash for the payment of dividends. It also includes the selling and buying of the company’s stock. When the company <span id="page_150" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="150"></span>
 sells shares to finance a new plant, cash flows in to the company. When the company buys back its shares, cash flows out of the company. The same thing happens with bonds: Sell a bond and cash flows in; buy back a bond and cash flows out. All three of these entries are then added together to provide Total Cash from Financing Activities.</p>
<div class="box2">
<table class="table1">
<tr>
<td class="line100" colspan="2">
<p class="tdmill">($ in millions)</p>

<p class="tdpara">Total Cash from Financing Activities</p>
</td>
<td class="line30">
<p class="tdright">$973</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if we add the Total Cash from Operating Activities, with Cash for Investing Activities, together with the Total Cash from Financing Activities, we get the company’s Net Change in Cash.</p>

 What Warren has discovered is that some of the information found on a company’s cash flow statement can be very useful in helping us determine whether or not the company in question is benefiting from having a durable competitive advantage. So let’s roll up our sleeves and dive into the cash flow statement to see what Warren is seeing, as he searches for the company that will make him his next billion.</p>
