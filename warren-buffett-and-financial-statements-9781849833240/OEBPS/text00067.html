We specifically wish to thank our publishers Susan Moldow and Roz Lippel, who have given us a great deal of freedom in the writing of this book. We also owe a very special thank-you to Roz for those finishing touches that only a great editor can add. We also wish to thank Tom Dussel for his brilliant handling of our international partners who publish our books.</p>

My sisters, Dorothy Manley, for always being there for me through thick and thin, and Laura Sir Mons, whom I still look to for the very important part of life, living it to the fullest. Jim Manley, my brother-in-law, who always inspires us to reach perfection by practice practice practice.…</p>

I also wish to thank Jay Hill, my co-blogger and the smartest girl I know. And a very special thank-you to the great musician/composer Ken Hankins, aka “Joy,” who inspires me every day.</p>
<p class="indent">David wishes to thank Kate and Dexter for all their love, Sam and Andy for being great brothers, and Cindy Connolly and Bob Eisenberg for being the fantastic friends that they always have been. He owes a special gratitude to artists Terry Rosenberg and Steve Joy for always answering the call to coffee and to filmmaker Alexander Payne for many really great conversations. He gives a special thank-you to Todd Simon for a ton of things, including bringing Betiana and Mia into our lives.</p>
<p class="indent">David also wishes to thank Wyoming attorney Gerry Spence for his deep friendship and helpful guidance over many years. No man ever had a better or more interesting friend.</p>
