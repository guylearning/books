 ntangible assets are assets we can’t physically touch; these include patents, copyrights, trademarks, franchises, brand names, and the like. A long time ago, a company could slap on <span id="page_97" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="97"></span>
 to its intangibles any old valuation it thought it could get away with. Which made for some very interesting valuations and many abuses. In the current era, companies are not allowed to carry internally developed intangible assets on their balance sheets. That’s put an end to watering the balance sheet with fantasy valuations for intangible assets.</p>
<p class="indent">However, intangible assets that are acquired from a third party are carried on the balance sheet at their fair value. If an asset has a finite life—as a patent does—it is amortized over the course of its useful life with a yearly charge made to the income statement and the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="indent">An odd thing occurs with companies that benefit from a durable competitive advantage. Take the Coca-Cola Company for an example. Coke’s brand name is worth in excess of $100 billion, yet because it is an internally developed brand name, its real value as an intangible asset is not reflected on Coca-Cola’s balance sheet. The same thing applies to Wrigley, Pepsi Co., McDonald’s, and even Wal-Mart. Each of these companies benefits from having durable competitive advantage tied directly to its name; yet the value of their greatest asset, their name, isn’t recognized on their balance sheets.</p>
<p class="indent">This is one of the reasons that the durable competitive advantage’s power to increase shareholders’ wealth has remained hidden from investors for so long. Short of comparing ten years’ worth of income statements, investors have had no way of knowing it was there, or knowing of its potential <span id="page_98" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="98"></span>
 for making them superrich. This is how Warren was able to take large positions in such visible companies, like Coca-Cola, with the whole world watching. Yet the whole world had no clue why he was doing it. Coke was too pricey to make any sense to the value investors that followed Graham, and its price wasn’t volatile enough to be interesting to Wall Street traders. What Warren could see, that no one else could, was Coke’s durable competitive advantage and the long-term earning power that came with it. Earning power that, over time, would help make him the richest man in the world.</p>
