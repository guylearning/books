 ust like every other taxpayer, American corporations have to pay taxes on their income. Today, in America, that amount <span id="page_58" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="58"></span>
 is approximately 35% of their income. When taxes are paid, they are recorded on the income statement under the heading Income Taxes Paid.</p>
<p class="indent">Now what is interesting about Income Taxes Paid is that the line item reflects the company’s true pre-tax earnings. Sometimes, companies like to tell the world that they are making more money than they actually are. (Shocking, isn’t it?) One of the ways to see if they are telling the truth is to look at the documents they file with the SEC and see what they are paying in income taxes. Take the number they list as pre-tax operating income and deduct 35% from it. If the remainder doesn’t equal the amount the company reported as income taxes paid, we had better start asking some questions.</p>
<p class="indent">Warren has learned over the years that companies that are busy misleading the IRS are usually hard at work misleading their shareholders as well. The beauty of a company with a long-term competitive advantage is that it makes so much money it doesn’t have to mislead anyone to look good.</p>
