 n the above cash flow statement the company being examined paid out dividends of $3.149 million, bought back $219 million of its shares, and sold $4.341 million of new debt. All <span id="page_157" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="157"></span>
 of this gave the company a net addition of $973 million in cash from financing activities.</p>
<p class="indent">Companies that have durable competitive advantage working in their favor make a ton of money, which creates the lovely problem of having to do something with it. If they don’t just want to sit on it, or they can’t reinvest it in the existing business or find a new business to invest in, they can either pay it out as dividends to their shareholders or use it to buy back shares. Since shareholders have to pay income tax on the dividends, Warren has never been too fond of using dividends to increase shareholders’ wealth. This doesn’t make anyone happy. A neater trick that Warren loves is to use some of the excess money that the company is throwing off to buy back the company’s shares. This reduces the number of outstanding shares—which increases the remaining shareholders’ interest in the company—and increases the per-share earnings of the company, which eventually makes the stock price go up.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s look at an example: If the company earned $10 million and has one million shares outstanding, it would have earnings of $10 a share. If we increase the number of shares outstanding to two million, the per-share earnings will drop to $5 a share. Likewise, if we decrease the number of shares outstanding to 500,000, we will increase the per-share earnings to $20 a share. More shares outstanding means lower per-share earnings, and lower shares outstanding means higher per-share earnings. Thus if the company buys back its own shares <span id="page_158" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="158"></span>
 it can increase its per-share earnings figure even though actual net earnings don’t increase. The best part is that there is an increase in the shareholders’ wealth that they don’t have to pay taxes on until they sell their stock. Think of it as the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<p class="indent">Warren is such a big fan of this bit of financial engineering that he pushes the board of directors of all the excellent companies he invests in to buy back shares instead of increasing the dividend. He used it with GEICO, and he still is using it with The Washington Post Company.</p>
<p class="indent">To find out if a company is buying back its shares, go to the cash flow statement and look under Cash from Investing Activities. There you will find a heading titled “Issuance (Retirement) of Stock, Net.” This entry nets out the selling and buying back of the company’s shares. If the company is buying back its shares year after year, it is a good bet that it is a durable competitive advantage that is generating all the extra cash that allows it to do so.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, one of the indicators of the presence of a durable competitive advantage is a “history” of the company repurchasing or retiring its shares.</p>
