 alculation: Net Earnings divided by Shareholders’ Equity equals Return on Shareholders’ Equity.</p>
<p class="indent">What Warren discovered is that companies that benefit from a durable or long-term competitive advantage show higher-than-average returns on shareholders’ equity. Warren’s favorite, Coca-Cola, shows a return on shareholders’ equity of 30%; Wrigley comes in at 24%; Hershey’s earns a delicious 33%; and Pepsi measures in at 34%.</p>
<p class="indent">Shift over to a highly competitive business like the airlines, where no one company has a sustainable competitive advantage, and return on equity sinks dramatically. United Airlines, in a year that it makes money, comes in at 15%, and American Airlines earns 4%. Delta Air Lines and Northwest don’t earn anything because they don’t earn any money.</p>
<p class="indent">High returns on equity mean that the company is making good use of the earnings that it is retaining. As time goes by, <span id="page_142" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="142"></span>
 these high returns on equity will add up and increase the underlying value of the business, which, over time, will eventually be recognized by the stock market through an increasing price for the company’s stock.</p>
<p class="indent">Please note: Some companies are so profitable that they don’t need to retain any earnings, so they pay them all out to the shareholders. In these cases we will sometimes see a negative number for shareholders’ equity. The danger here is that insolvent companies will also show a negative number for shareholders’ equity. If the company shows a long history of strong net earnings, but shows a negative shareholders’ equity, it is probably a company with a durable competitive advantage. If the company shows both negative shareholders’ equity and a history of negative net earnings, we are probably dealing with a mediocre business that is getting beaten up by the competition.</p>
<p class="indent">So here is the rule: High returns on shareholders’ equity means “come play.” Low returns on shareholders’ equity mean “stay away.”</p>
<p class="indent">Got it? Okay, let’s move on.</p>
