 nventory is the company’s products that it has warehoused to sell to its vendors. Since a balance sheet is always for a specific day, the amount found on the balance sheet for inventory is the value of the company’s inventory for that date.</p>

 With a lot of businesses, there is a risk of inventory becoming obsolete. But as we have discussed earlier, manufacturing companies with a durable competitive advantage have an advantage, in that the products they sell never change and therefore never become obsolete. This is an advantage Warren wants to see.</p>
<p class="indent">When trying to identify a manufacturing company with a durable competitive advantage, look for an inventory and net earnings that are on a corresponding rise. This indicates that the company is finding profitable ways to increase sales, and that increase in sales has called for an increase in inventory, so the company can fulfill orders on time.</p>
<p class="indent">Manufacturing companies with inventories that rapidly ramp up for a few years and then, just as rapidly, ramp down, are more likely than not companies caught in highly competitive industries subject to booms and busts. And no one ever got rich going bust.</p>
