And a knowledge organization has to be both a <span class="italic">learning organization</span> and a <span class="italic">teaching organization.</span> Knowledge today, in all areas, changes so fast that knowledge workers become obsolete pretty soon unless they build <span class="italic">continuous learning into their work.</span> And that is not just true of high knowledge such as that of the engineer, the chemist, the biologist, or the accountant. Itâ€™s increasingly just as true of the cardiac nurse, the person who handles payroll records, and the computer repair person. But also, a knowledge organization depends on knowledge specialists understanding what their colleagues are doing or trying to do. And each of them has a different specialty. Knowledge workers need, therefore, to hold themselves responsible for educating their colleagues, especially when the knowledge base of their own specialty changes.</p>
<p class="para">This means that knowledge workers are well advised to sit down and answer two questions:</p>
<ol class="ol-arabic">
<li>What do I need to learn to keep abreast of the knowledge I am being paid to know?</li>
<li>And what do my associates have to know and understand about my knowledge area and about what it can and should contribute to the organization and to their own work?</li>
</ol>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><small>ACTION POINT:</small> Answer the two questions at the end of this reading.</p>
