<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>he question has to be asked—and asked seriously—“If we did not do this already, would we, knowing what we know, go into it now?” If the answer is no, the reaction must be “What do we do now?”</p>
<p class="para">In three cases the right action is always outright abandonment. Abandonment is the right action if a product, service, market, or process “still has a few years of life.” It is these dying products, services, or processes that always demand the greatest care and the greatest efforts. They tie down the most productive and ablest people. But equally, a product, service, market, or process should be abandoned if the only argument for keeping it is “It is fully written off.” For <span class="italic">management</span> purposes there are no “cost-less assets.” There are only “sunk costs.” The third case where abandonment is the right policy—and the most important one—is the one where, for the sake of maintaining the old or declining product, service, market, or process the <span class="italic">new</span> and growing product, service, or process is being stunted or neglected.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent"><small>ACTION POINT:</small> Ask the questions posed above and if the answer is no, make the tough choice to abandon a cherished business.</p>
