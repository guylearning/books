For this book, I wrote a kind of intellectual autobiography, which constitutes the last chapter of the book. In it, I record the beginning of my work more than sixty years ago, which was concerned with the balance between change and continuity. It was this concern that, ten years later, led me to the study of management. For I see in management, the specific organ of society that has to maintain the dynamic equilibrium between change and continuity, without which societies, organizations, and individuals perish.</p>
