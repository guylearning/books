<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">F</span></span>reedom is not fun. It is not the same as individual happiness, nor is it security or peace or progress. It is a responsible choice. Freedom is not so much a right as a duty. Real freedom is not freedom from something; that would be license. It is freedom to choose between doing or not doing something, to act one way or another, to hold one belief or the opposite. It is not “fun” but the heaviest burden laid on man: to decide his own individual conduct as well as the conduct of society and to be responsible for both decisions.</p>

Think of goals that will meet your need for personal fulfillment, while also helping your boss meet his or her performance objectives. Sell these goals to your boss and keep the boss informed on your progress.</p>
