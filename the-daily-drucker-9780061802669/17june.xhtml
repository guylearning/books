Only one thing can be said with certainty: obstacles to, and penalties on, capital formation are a luxury that a society under pension-fund socialism—and a society in which a large number of older people have to be supported in retirement—can ill afford. But one can say definitely that capital formation rather than consumption will of necessity become the central problem of domestic economic policy in the years ahead, and the acid test of the economic viability of America’s pension-fund socialism.</p>
