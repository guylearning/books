<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">A</span></span>ll the effective leaders I have encountered—both those I worked with and those I merely watched—knew four simple things: a leader is someone who has <span class="italic">followers;</span> popularity is not leadership, <span class="italic">results are;</span> leaders are highly visible, they set <span class="italic">examples;</span> leadership is not rank, privilege, titles, or money, it is <span class="italic">responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="para">When I was in my final high school years, our excellent history teacher—himself a badly wounded war veteran—told each of us to pick several of a whole spate of history books on World War I and write a major essay on our selections. When we then discussed these essays in class, one of my fellow students said, “Every one of these books says that the Great War was a war of total military incompetence. <span class="italic">Why was it?”</span> Our teacher did not hesitate a second but shot right back, “Because not enough generals were killed; they stayed way behind the lines and let others do the fighting and dying.” Effective leaders delegate, but they do not delegate the one thing that will set the standards. <span class="italic">They do it.</span></p>

<p class="paraNoIndent"><small>ACTION POINT:</small> Don’t expect to retain the respect of your employees if you completely delegate the central function of your enterprise, whether it’s healing patients or selling bonds.</p>
