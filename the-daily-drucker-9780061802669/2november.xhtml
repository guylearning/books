It involves gathering and organizing outside information and then integrating this information into decisions. Organized information about the environment needs to include information about actual and potential competitors worldwide. However, not all outside information is available. But, even when information is available, many businesses are oblivious to it. Half of new technologies that transform an industry come from outside the industry, and information about these new technologies is available.

Information on these developments is available and companies in the pharmaceutical industry must keep abreast of these developments.</p>
