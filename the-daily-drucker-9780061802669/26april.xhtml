But also, every boom—and I have lived and worked through four or five—puts crooks in at the top.

The only thing new is that the last boom considerably increased the temptation to fake the books—the exclusive emphasis on quarterly figures, the overemphasis on the stock price, the well-meant but idiotic belief that executives should have major financial stakes in the company, the stock options (which I have always considered an open invitation to mismanagement), and so on. Otherwise there’s no difference.</p>
