<p class="P_AH2-14">Accrued Expenses</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The term “accrual accounting” refers to the accounting basis used to prepare a set of accounts, as discussed in Part 2, Chapter 8. It contrasts with the cash accounting basis or simply “cash accounting”. The term “accrual accounting” sounds similar to making an accrual, but it is used differently.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The terms accrual, expense accrual, revenue accrual, or to make an accrual are used to describe the recognition of an expense or revenue, specifically when no invoicing has taken place (yet).</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">When a business has done a value-consuming activity—in other words, has incurred an expense—but has not yet received an invoice for that expense, we talk about recognizing the expense on the income statement (and affecting profit) by making an accrual and showing it as an accrued<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_4_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>expense.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Accruals like this are often recognized—that is, journaled—at a period end so that the reported profit figure at the period-end date is correct on the income statement and balance sheet. If, at period end, you know an expense has been incurred but the supplier hasn’t yet sent you the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>invoice<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>for<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>it,<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>you<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>would<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>recognize<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>expense<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>by<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>making<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>an<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>accrual.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">So, let’s ask our habitual questions for this scenario.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">What are the two impacts? <span class="C_Current__And__Properties">We </span>know there has been an expense, and we can use the same account as before, so we’ll use Cleaning. The fact that we haven’t paid for the cleaning makes<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>no difference to the expense account. The second account will be a liability account. <span class="C_Current__And__Properties">We </span>won’t use the account payable account, because the cleaners don’t have to be legally paid until we receive an invoice from them. Remember how in the chapter about buying on credit, we said that the word “invoice” comes from the Latin <i>in </i>+ <i>vox </i>because an invoice calls in what’s due? Well, Ace Cleaners haven’t called in our debt yet, but we know that we are nevertheless indebted. So, we will create another short-term liability account, which we’ll call Accrued Expenses. Yes, this is another language paradox. The word “expense” appears in the title of the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>account<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>but<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>it’s<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>not<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>an<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>expense<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>account.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Are they increasing or decreasing? Both accounts are increasing.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA"><span class="C_Current__And__Properties">To </span>reflect the increase-impacts, we use the journal to debit the debit-type expense account and<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>credit<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>credit-type<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>liability<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>account.</p>

<p class="P_AH2-14">BaSIS Framework: Accrued Expense</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The Framework in <i>Figure 134 </i>below shows the Cleaning expense account debited and the Accrued Expenses liability account credited in order to recognize the cleaning activity that has<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>been<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>consumed<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>but<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>not<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>yet<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>invoiced.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Cleaning expenses have now increased to $220 from $50, and the Accrued Expense liability<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>has appeared, going from zero to $170. The profit account has decreased by $170 from $2,280 to<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>$2,110.</p>
<p class="P_AH2-14">Changing Obligations</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The business now has the same total assets of $57,330 as it had just before the cleaning expense<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>happened.<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>No<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>change<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>there.

<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The two balance sheet impacts are both on the “sources of funds” side of the framework.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Total liabilities increased by $170 and total equity decreased by $170 (via an increase in expenses). The equity reduction happened in the profit account.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">In other words, the business has the same amount of assets, but the mix of obligations to the funders has changed. From the funders’ point of view, the creditors are claiming a greater share<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>of<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>business’s<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>assets<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>and<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>owners<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>are<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>claiming<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>a<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>lesser<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>share.</p>

<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Sometimes, students of accounting will say something pragmatic like <span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_7_CLOSEPAR_">“Why </span>not just wait until the invoice comes in and record it as an expense in the next period? At least we won’t have to<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>guess<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>at<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>invoice<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>amount!”</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Yes, the amount will be accurate, but the profit earned for the current period will be overstated, and for the next period it will be understated. The expense was incurred in the March period and should therefore impact the March result. And while an expense of this amount is likely to be immaterial to the results, if we don’t have a process in place to catch such events, then a<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>much<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>larger<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>impact<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>could<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>be<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>missed.</p>

<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The business has total assets of $57,330, funded by $35,220 of debt obligation and $22,110 of equity obligation.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The equity obligation comprises $20,000 contributed equity and $2,110 generated equity. The generated equity came about from $3,100 of value-generating activity and $990 of value-sacrificing activity, giving a net value generation of $2,110 during the period. The net value generation links to the balance sheet where the generated obligation to the shareholders is shown.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The $990 of value-sacrificing activity comprises $770 of sacrifices directly associated with the revenue generation and $220 of sacrifices indirectly linked to revenue generation, often referred to as<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_4_CLOSEPAR_"> </span><i>overhead</i>.</p>
<p class="P_AH2-14">Discussion: More about Expenses<br/><br/>Comprehensive Definition of Expense: Net Value-Sacrificing activity</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Until now, we’ve defined an expense as an activity that consumes assets. We’ve seen a couple of examples of such activities. In Transactions 6(b) and 8(b), the activity involved handing over ownership of our valuable inventory to customers who walked off with what were formerly our<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>possessions.<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span><span class="C_Current__And__Properties">We</span><span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>called<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>that<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>activity<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>Cost<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>of<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>Sales,<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>or<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>Cost<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>of<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>Goods<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>Sold.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">In Transaction 7, the activity was window cleaning, which resulted in $50 of our precious cash being given to the window cleaners.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">However, in Transaction 9, no asset was reduced. Instead, a liability increased.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">In both cases, whether an asset was reduced or a liability increased, the profit account in equity was reduced to the detriment of the shareholders. The result was detrimental to the owners because their claim on the business reduced, mirroring the decrease in total equity.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Seeing the two different manifestations of an expense (asset decrease or expense increase) has<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>us define what an expense is more comprehensively. Rather than thinking of an expense only as an activity that reduces assets, we now define an expense as any activity that decreases an asset<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>or<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>increases<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>a<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>liability<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>to<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>detriment<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>of<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>owners.</p>

<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Being able to buy goods and services on credit is a great funding resource for a business. Particularly if the business can negotiate longish payment terms with its trade creditors, it means that the business can get on with its business of generating profit and cash flow without immediately having to fork out cash. Trade creditors can be a significant source of funds<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>for<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>a<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>business.<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>On<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>Global’s<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>balance<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>sheet,<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>you<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>will<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>see<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>that<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>its<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>Payables<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>creditors<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>are<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_5_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>funding $182,475 of Global’s assets.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">How long a supplier will give you to pay them depends on their terms, which may be part of a negotiated arrangement between you and them. When one business is powerful and buys a lot from a supplier, they can often demand very generous payment terms, like thirty, sixty, or even ninety<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_4_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>days.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">A huge company like Walmart pays its suppliers slowly because it can. Walmart also sells its inventory very quickly. The company’s stock turn, or inventory turnover, is extremely high, and that velocity is part of their formula for success. The general idea in business, especially retail, is to keep as little inventory as you can and then to replenish the shelves as quickly as you can so that you don’t run out and lose sales. Nobody wants to go to a chicken shop that’s run out of<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_1_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>chicken.</p>
<p class="P_AH2_Center"><span>Not Too Much, Not Too Little</span></p>
<p class="P_AH2-14">Insolvency</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Having said that accounts payable is an important source of funding for many businesses, it is<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>also<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>often<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>most<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>dangerous<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>line<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>on<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>a<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>balance<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>sheet.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The fatal danger to any business is that it can’t pay its debts as and when they fall due. If it<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>can’t, then it’s judged to be insolvent. Any creditor who is owed payment by a company can ask a judge to force the company to pay up. If the judge decides that the debt is valid and the company can’t pay, the judge can declare the company bankrupt<i>. </i>The word comes from the mid-sixteenth century Italian <i>banca rotta</i>, meaning “broken bench.” In years gone by, creditors would smash the workbenches of their debtors when they didn’t pay up. Those debtors were also thrown into what were called debtors’ prisons. Both practices, of course, were not very enlightened because it’s harder to pay off your debts when you’ve got no workbench or when you’re shackled in a dungeon.</p>
<p class="P_AH2_Center"><span>Banca Rotta and Shackles</span></p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Modern legal jurisdictions now have a more enlightened approach to bankruptcy. Companies<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>in the US can, for instance, be put into Chapter 11. This is the title of a chapter of the US Bankruptcy Code. The provisions of the Chapter allow the debtor or creditor to petition a bankruptcy court to approve a reorganization arrangement. This reorganization gives<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_13_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the company the right and ability to break certain agreements and cancel contracts, and to obtain new loans that rank above prior obligations. The intention is that the reorganized company can<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>trade<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>its<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>way<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>out<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>of<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>insolvency,<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>and<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>overall<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>people<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>will<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>be<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>better<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>off.</p>
<p class="P_AH2-14">Liquidation</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Sometimes there’s no light on the horizon and the courts will decide to liquidate the business. This means it will stop operating and its frozen assets will be sold off to pay its creditors. They are paid in their order of entitlement, from secured creditors down through unsecured<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>and subordinated creditors. Many will expect to get less than the full value of their debt. Shareholders are at the back of the queue, and often lose their total investment. Recall the discussion<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>about<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>Debt<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>vs.<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>Equity,<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>particularly<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>discussion<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>about<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>priority.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">One of the biggest instances of bankruptcy and liquidation was Lehman Brothers, Inc., a US bank that had assets of about $700 billion with which to settle its obligations. The authors of this book were owed money for teaching at that bank. In the end, we got 43 cents on the dollar,<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>as<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>they<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>say,<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>or<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>43<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>percent<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>of<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>what<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>we<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>were<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>owed.</p>

<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The reason, of course, that accounts payable are dangerous is that they are short-term debts. Chief Financial Officers don’t lay awake at night worried about whether they will be able to<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>pay off a twenty-year bond. What keeps them up at night is concern about next week’s payroll, and those suppliers who are due to be paid tomorrow. In the case of key suppliers, such as a manufacturer supplying white goods to an appliance store, not only will they demand payment for their debts owed, but they may also stop supplying further inventory to the store, which further worsens the store’s plight. Having found that they are at risk of not getting paid for goods already delivered, they will think twice before delivering any more goods for which they might also not get paid. The supplier might find themselves in the uncomfortable position of cutting off a foot (contributing to the demise of the business and not getting paid fully) to save<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>leg<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>(staunching<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>even<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>further<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>losses).</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Do they keep supplying the retailer to help it continue to operate and hopefully repay all that’s due but in the process risk getting in deeper and possibly losing even more? Or does the supplier cut their losses and stop supplying any further goods, accepting—and perhaps crystalizing—some non-repayment, bad-debt<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>loss?</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA"><span class="C_Current__And__Properties">We </span>met the Current Ratio and talked about how it measures the amount of current assets available to pay for the current liabilities of the business. As mentioned earlier, the current ratio is a crude indicator that management and creditors keep an eye on as they manage the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>risk of default.</p>
