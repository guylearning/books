<p class="P_AH2_-14_Emph">Peter Frampton and Mark Robilliard</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Two failed accounting students walked into a bar…</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Sounds like an old joke, but it’s not too far from the truth! Back in the 1990s, Mark and Peter—by then accomplished accountants working for the world’s largest accounting firm—met and realized they shared a common conviction:<span class="C_Current__And__Properties"> </span>there must be a better way to explain accounting.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Peter had to repeat Accounting 101 at university: such was his shock at the discovery of his<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>first<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>academic<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>failure<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>he<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>fell<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>down<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>stairs<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>and<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>sprained<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>his<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>ankle.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Mark signed up for accounting at university because marine biology didn’t accept him. It didn’t take long for his regrets to kick in. “Accounting 101 made me feel stupid. I memorized my way through college and then got a job at an accounting practice where I was soon in front of my boss, admitting that I didn’t know what I was doing. He sat me down and showed me how to manually lay out the balance sheet and income statement accounts on a large pad.

<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">This book is the result of a long journey of discovery, in which we have had the privilege of teaching—and being taught by—people like you.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">We’ve come to love accounting, love the teaching of it, and deeply believe that accounting literacy improves the world.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">As Toby York says in the foreword: accounting is amazing. It’s everywhere in your life, enabling almost everything you do. Accounting is at the heart of financial accountability—in your personal life, in business, in politics, and in general society. Accountability is what makes the world go around.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Accounting enables trade and commerce and has facilitated the advance of civilization over the last five centuries. It’s an art, a science, a language, an invention, and a technology that is exquisitely built upon simple and elegant principles. Accounting has a rich and consequential history. Humble bookkeeping spread the Arabic numeral system throughout Europe—a much better system than the Roman system that it displaced—thus enabling the Renaissance.<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_6_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>Science, empirical thought, and rationalism benefited enormously. Accounting’s history is woven, for good or bad, into the rise of nations, colonialism, and global trade. Colonialism… not so good. But trade? Well, as they say, <span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_7_CLOSEPAR_">“When </span>goods cross borders, soldiers don’t.” Yes, free trade is a very<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>good<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>thing,<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_8_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>and<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>accounting<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>is<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>behind<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>it<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>all.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The United States itself began as a financial venture. The Mayflower Compact of 1620 had its own books of account to track expenses and profits. Later, the constitution of the new<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>nation required in Article 1 that “Statements of Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published.” And there it is: accounting at the very heart of the greatest<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>experiment<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>in<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>democracy—the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>written<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>constitution<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>of<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>those<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>uniting<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>states.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Accounting gives people a voice. And that’s what we want for you, dear reader, learner, discoverer: a voice to express your own mission and purpose. So, thank you for picking up this book and allowing us to share our own journey of discovery with you. Accounting turns out to be simple and really easy to conquer when you clarify the language, draw a clear color-coded diagram, and follow a step by step explanatory sequence.</p>
