<p class="P_AH1_left__And__Page_Break">Foreword</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Accounting has a reputation it does not deserve. You’ve heard the stereotypical old tropes about accountants being boring, conservative and pedantic. Even among its academics, accounting is commonly viewed as little more than a functional skill – the poor cousin of “finance”.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Its image, however, is a result of its extraordinary success. Accounting is ubiquitous and so deeply embedded in our lives that we’ve lost sight of it. It’s become the water that fish will never discover. It’s everywhere in your life, enabling almost everything you do, from catching a bus to building or renting your house to supporting your preferred charity to shopping and saving.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Arguably, the three most important social technologies in the history of human civilisation are literacy, numeracy, and accounting. Most surprisingly, accounting might predate the other two.<a id="ref_footnotebookmark_start_9_4_1"/><span style=" font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: super;"><a href="#ref_footnotebookmark_end_9_4_1">1</a></span><span style=" font-size: 0.50em;"> </span>Recent academic research suggests that accounting did not arise from the increasing complexity of economies, but has been present in all but the most rudimentary societies for about 10,000 years.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Double-entry bookkeeping, which is accounting perfected, is a comparatively new innovation, dating back to the 13th century, possibly earlier, and is the subject of the best-known book about accounting, Luca Pacioli’s <i>Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalita, </i>(Summary of arithmetic, geometry, proportions and proportionality), first published in 1494. Pacioli’s bookkeeping method uses the left and right side of a book, or ledger, to set out the double entries. This is an effective recording mechanism, but it is not an effective learning method.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Today, not much has changed, either in terms of record keeping or accounting education—I was told “debit the window—credit the door”, because the window was on the left of the classroom and the door was on the right. <span class="C_Current__And__Properties">To </span>the teacher, however, the opposite was true, so it wasn’t a satisfactory learning aid, it did nothing to explain why each entry was on a particular side, and completely useless if you found yourself in a place where the windows were on the other side of the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_1_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>room.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">This book is different. The accounting concepts are entirely orthodox, but the methods used to teach them are novel. Peter Frampton and Mark Robilliard provide some deceptively simple twists, including using different colours instead of two sides of a ledger; and showing the complete accounting framework in a unique and memorable form—what they call the “Color Accounting BaSIS Framework”. These may sound like trivial innovations, but the effects on learners are dramatic. I have been using their method in classrooms and workshops for some years and the speed of learning and depth of understanding of participants never fail to amaze me.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">The essence of accounting today is no different to the system that Pacioli described, but it is<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_2_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>not its historical longevity that makes reading this book a worthwhile investment—accounting, and specifically double-entry bookkeeping, will never become obsolete, even when the robots take over. It is hard to see how it can be improved and, astonishingly, it is a universal technology used by individuals, communities and organisations throughout the world, regardless of their size, location, area of operation or complexity. There’s only one system to learn, and once<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>learned<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>you<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>can<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>carry<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>it<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>with<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>you<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>for<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>the<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>rest<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>of<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>your<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_3_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>life.</p>
<p class="P_No_Indent_SA">Don’t worry—this book will not turn you into an accountant, but it will make you accounting literate: you will feel confident to ask the right questions when using financial information. Whether you are in politics, in business, in work or just everyday life, understanding accounting gives you a voice. Not being accounting literate is like not understanding grammar. You’ll get by, but you may well be limited and miss out on wonderful opportunities to be the best person you can<span class="C_Current__And__Properties__OPENPAR_4_CLOSEPAR_"> </span>be.</p>
