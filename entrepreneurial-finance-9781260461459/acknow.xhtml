<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I </span>greatly appreciate the help with this book that I received from numerous people, including my oldest daughter, Akilah Rogers, who is also an HBS alum, and Darlene Le, my HBS assistant. I also owe a major debt of gratitude to former students who helped me with the previous editions. They are Thane Gauthier, Paul Smith, Scott Whitaker, David Wildermuth, and Roza Makonnen, my former co-author.</p>
