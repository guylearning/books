<p class="noindent">The Power BI service has many features designed for collaboration and sharing the results of your work with others in a secure way. It also allows you to efficiently keep data in your reports up to date.</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter, we first review the skills necessary to refresh datasets on a periodic basis and how to do so incrementally. We also describe the various ways in which datasets can be secured, which includes segregating access to different parts of the dataset for different groups of people. Since it may be useful to reuse a dataset for different purposes, we also look at how you can raise awareness of a dataset you manage.</p>
<p class="indent">In the next part of the chapter, we review how to create and manage workspaces, which are meant for collaboration in the Power BI service. Once you’re ready to share the results of your work, you can package the content you created in an app and share it with a wider audience. We conclude the chapter by reviewing data sensitivity labels for workspace content.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec1">Skill 4.1: Manage files and datasets</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the Power BI service, reports and datasets are separate concepts; reports contain visualizations and related information, such as bookmarks, whereas datasets contain only the modeled data. One dataset may potentially have more than one report, whereas one report can be connected to one dataset only.</p>
<p class="indent">Keeping data up to date is almost always important, and the Power BI service provides a way to do it at fixed intervals in an efficient manner by refreshing only the latest data, if needed.</p>
<p class="indent">You have several options to provide access to a dataset to your users: you can grant full access to the whole dataset, read-only access to the whole dataset, or access to only those rows that you want users to see. Once you are ready to share a dataset with others, you can promote or certify it to facilitate its discovery throughout your organization.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">Identify when a gateway is required</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you want to refresh a dataset that uses on-premises data, you need to install an on-premises data gateway on a computer within your network. A gateway can access on-premises and online data sources when you add data sources to it, which may include the connection details and credentials—the gateway acts as a bridge between the Power BI service and your on-premises data sources.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two on-premises data gateway modes:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Standard mode</strong> Multiple people can use the gateway, and you can use it with other Microsoft services as well, such as Power Automate. This mode is appropriate for corporate environments because you can add each data source once, and then the gateway users will all be able to use it. You can specify generic credentials for data sources.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Personal mode</strong> Only one person can use the gateway, and you can use it only with Power BI. This mode is useful only when you don’t plan to share the gateway with others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Alternatively, if you only need to connect to cloud data sources secured by virtual networks, then you need to use a virtual network (VNet) data gateway. In this case, you don’t have to install a gateway because it’s a service that runs in the cloud.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2">Configure a dataset scheduled refresh</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you build a report, a common requirement is to keep the underlying data up to date. You can refresh a dataset manually in Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service, but this approach isn’t viable when you need to refresh data periodically. To address this issue, you can configure a scheduled refresh in the Power BI service.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_179"></span>You configure a scheduled refresh for each dataset individually in the dataset settings. For this, expand the <strong>Scheduled refresh</strong> section of the dataset settings and switch the <strong>Keep your data up to date</strong> toggle to <strong>On</strong>. You will then be able to configure refresh frequency and other settings, as shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig01">Figure 4-1</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch04fig01">
<img src="graphics/04fig01.jpg" alt="The figure shows the settings that can be configured for scheduled refresh." width="243" height="453"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 4-1</strong> Scheduled refresh settings.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">You can configure the following settings for scheduled refresh:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Refresh frequency</strong> Specify how often the dataset will be refreshed: Daily or Weekly. If you set this option to Weekly, you can select the days of the week the refresh will run.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Time zone</strong> The time zone of refreshes.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Time</strong> You can add the time of refreshes in 30-minute intervals. The maximum number of refreshes you can set depends on whether the workspace is backed by a Premium capacity.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Send refresh failure notifications to</strong> This option can send an email to the dataset owner in case of a refresh failure. You can enter email addresses of other users who will receive the notifications, which can be useful when multiple people are responsible for the dataset.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">After you adjust settings, select <strong>Apply</strong>. If you select Apply without setting the scheduled refresh time, your dataset will refresh at midnight.</p>
<p class="indent">You can see refresh history of a dataset at the top of the dataset settings by selecting <strong>Refresh history</strong>.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_180"></span>Configure row-level security group membership</h4>
<p class="noindent">Configuring row-level security (RLS) is a two-step process. In Skill 2.2: Develop a data model, we reviewed the first step—implementing RLS roles in Power BI Desktop. In this section, we review the steps needed to complete the RLS setup for a dataset; we assign and test roles in the Power BI service.</p>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3sec73">Assigning roles in the Power BI service</h5>
<p class="noindent">Once you’ve configured row-level security roles in Power BI Desktop, you need to publish your report to the Power BI service and add members to each role. To do so, go to the dataset security settings by hovering over a dataset in the list of workspace items and selecting <strong>More options</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong>. If you don’t have any roles defined in the dataset, you’ll see the message in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig02">Figure 4-2</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch04fig02">
<img src="graphics/04fig02.jpg" alt="The message reads, “RLS has moved to Power BI Desktop. Any previously defined RLS security is no longer working. You will need to re-create RLS in Power BI Desktop. In the Power BI Service, you can add members to roles you create.”" width="650" height="167"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 4-2</strong> The RLS has moved to Power BI Desktop message.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If you’ve created RLS roles defined in the dataset, you’ll see a page like the one shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig03">Figure 4-3</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch04fig03">
<img src="graphics/04fig03.jpg" alt="The figure shows a page with list of roles on the left and role members on the right." width="650" height="309"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 4-3</strong> Row-level security role membership.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">On the left side of the Row-Level Security page, you can see a list of all roles in the dataset. The numbers in brackets show how many members each role has. On the right, you can view, add, and remove members for a selected role.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_181"></span>To add a member to a role, first select a role on the left, and then enter email addresses or security groups in the <strong>People or groups who belong to this role</strong> field. After you enter new members, select <strong>Add</strong> &gt; <strong>Save</strong>. The changes will be applied immediately.</p>
<p class="indent">To remove a member from a role, select the cross next to the member and then select <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">When you use row-level security in Power BI, you can use an email address for each user. Although this solution works, it can be hard to maintain. For example, consider that you have several datasets that use RLS based on the same rules and it’s viewed mostly by the same users. If a new user joins your company and you need to give them access to those datasets, you will have to update the row-level security settings for each dataset.</p>
<p class="indent">In cases like this, you can assign security groups as members of row-level security roles. When a new user joins the company, you will have to add them to the security group only once. The same principles apply to sharing content in Power BI, which we cover later in this chapter.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3sec74">Viewing as roles in the Power BI service</h5>
<p class="noindent">As you saw with the View as feature in Power BI Desktop, you can test roles in the Power BI service. For this, you need to hover over a role on the Row-Level Security page and select <strong>More options</strong> (the ellipsis) &gt; <strong>Test as role</strong>. You will then see the way a report appears to the members of the role. For example, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig04">Figure 4-4</a> shows what members of the Plains role would see, which you created in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, “Model the data.” The role applies a filter on Sales Territory.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch04fig04">

<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 4-4</strong>  Testing a role in the Power BI service.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_182"></span>If needed, you can test a combination of roles or view as a specific user by selecting <strong>Now viewing as</strong> in the blue bar at the top and selecting the desired parameters. Once you are satisfied with how the roles work, you can select <strong>Back to Row-Level Security</strong>.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec4">Provide access to datasets</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Power BI service enables collaboration between different users. To let other users build reports based on a dataset that you published, you have to share the dataset with them. There are several ways of achieving this, as described next.</p>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3sec75">Sharing through a workspace</h5>
<p class="noindent">When publishing to the Power BI service, you can publish to your own workspace or a shared workspace. Contributing users of shared workspaces will automatically have access to the dataset you publish.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3sec76">Sharing through an app</h5>
<p class="noindent">You can also make your dataset available for others when you share an app with them. For this, you’ll need to grant the app users the Build permission by selecting the <strong>Allow all users to connect to the app's underlying datasets using the Build permission</strong> check box, as shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig05">Figure 4-5</a>.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3sec78">Impact analysis</h5>
<p class="noindent">For datasets you share, it may be useful to know what other reports or dashboards use this dataset. Since Power BI allows you to use the same dataset across different workspaces, the reports and dashboards that use the dataset may reside outside of its home workspace, and the owner of the dataset may not always have access to the workspace. This information is contained in the dataset’s impact analysis. To see the impact analysis, in the dataset menu select <strong>View lineage</strong>. You’ll see the information shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig07">Figure 4-7</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch04fig07">

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_185"></span>Impact analysis shows the list of reports and dashboards across all workspaces related to the dataset. For each item, you can see how many viewers and views it had in the last 30 days, excluding today, and which workspace it’s in. Impact analysis is particularly useful when you’re making potentially breaking changes to the dataset because you know which items are going to be affected, as well as how popular those items are. You can notify contacts of the affected reports and dashboards by selecting <strong>Notify contacts</strong>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Collaboration in Power BI happens in workspaces, which serve as containers for dashboards, reports, workbooks, datasets, and dataflows. In this section we cover how to create and configure a workspace and illustrate how the Power BI service lifecycle strategy can help you implement phased deployments. We also review the skills necessary to create and manage workspaces, assign roles, publish and update apps and workspace assets, and apply sensitivity labels to workspace items.</p>

Though it’s possible to share content from a personal workspace, the functionality is limited—for example, you cannot create an app in your workspace.</p>
<p class="indent">To collaborate with others or package content in an app to share with others, you should create a separate workspace. Doing so will allow others to publish to the same workspace, and you’ll have access to other Power BI features, such as dataflows.</p>

<p class="indent">When you publish a Power BI Desktop to a workspace, you publish the visualizations, which become a report in Power BI service. If there was an associated data model, it would become a Power BI dataset. As discussed in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, “Visualize and analyze the data,” dashboards can have visuals pinned from reports and directly from datasets. We review Power BI apps later in this chapter in detail.</p>
<p class="indent">To create a workspace in Power BI service, follow this procedure:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">From the left-hand menu, select <strong>Workspaces</strong> &gt; <strong>Create a workspace</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Enter the workspace name. The name must be unique in the organization.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Select <strong>Save</strong>.</p></li>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec8">Configure and update a workspace app</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you are ready to share your reports and dashboards with users in your organization, you can publish an app. An app is a collection of Power BI items, such as a dashboard, reports, and workbooks, packaged together. There can be only one app per app workspace.</p>
<p class="indent">When creating or updating an app, you can select which content items appear in the app by toggling the <strong>Include in app</strong> switch to <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>, as shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig10">Figure 4-10</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch04fig10">

<h5 class="h5" id="ch04lev3sec83">Update a published app</h5>
<p class="noindent">After you publish your app, you can make changes to it if you are a contributing workspace user. For this, you need to go to the app workspace and make the changes you want; once you have made the changes, go back to the app workspace list of contents and select <strong>Update app</strong>. You can also update the Setup, Navigation, and Permissions settings that you configured when you created the app, and then select <strong>Update app</strong> &gt; <strong>Update</strong> to propagate the app changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Note that on the Permissions screen, you will see the app link, as well as dashboard and report links. When you share any of those links, users will see all contents of the app, not just dashboards or reports.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec9">Publish, import, or update assets in a workspace</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can publish a report to the Power BI service from Power BI Desktop by selecting <strong>Publish</strong> on the <strong>Home</strong> ribbon. To publish a report from Power BI Desktop, you must be signed in. By default, your report will be published to your personal workspace, unless you already published to another workspace in the same session. If you are a contributor in other workspaces, you can select a workspace to publish to.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_194"></span>If the workspace you are publishing to already contains a dataset with the same name, you will be asked if you want to replace it, and you’ll see how many workspace items it affects, as shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig15">Figure 4-15</a>. This feature can be particularly useful when you’re updating a dataset that has other reports built from it.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch04fig15">

</figure>
<p class="indent">An alternative to publishing from Power BI Desktop is to publish from the Power BI service by going to a workspace and selecting <strong>New</strong> &gt; <strong>Upload a file</strong>. You’ll be given a choice to publish a local file, a file from OneDrive, or a file from SharePoint, as shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04fig16">Figure 4-16</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch04fig16">

</figure>
<p class="indent">Selecting <strong>Local File</strong> will prompt you to select a file from your computer to publish, whereas <strong>OneDrive</strong> and <strong>SharePoint</strong> options allow you to publish from the cloud. Publishing from OneDrive can be beneficial because you can edit a report locally in Power BI Desktop in a folder that’s synced to OneDrive, and it will be published automatically upon saving and closing the file because Power BI can sync published files from OneDrive.</p>

<p class="noindent">When you create Power BI content and share it, you can increase its visibility for other users by endorsing it. For example, other users can search for an endorsed dataset and build reports from it. When many datasets are available in the organization, it’s useful to know how reliable each dataset is—some may be created for test purposes only, whereas others may be considered a single source of truth in the company. By default, all datasets look the same when you search for datasets, be it from Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service. In this case, it may be a good idea to endorse datasets—let the reports creators know which datasets are high quality and reliable.</p>
<p class="indent">You can endorse datasets, dataflows, reports, and apps. There are two ways to endorse Power BI content:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Promote</strong> Promoted content has a badge that signifies that the content is ready to be used by others. Any contributing member of the workspace where the content resides can promote it. Content promotion facilitates the content being reused across the organization.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Certify</strong> Content can be certified to show that it’s recommended for use, meaning it is highly reliable and curated. Only people selected by the Power BI tenant admins can certify Power BI content.</p></li>

<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">To ensure that data in your datasets is kept up to date, the Power BI service enables you to configure scheduled refresh. If your dataset is based on on-premises data, you’ll need to use an on-premises data gateway. An on-premises data gateway is available in two modes: personal and standard. Personal mode is for use by a single person; on-premises data gateway in standard mode can be used by the whole company. If you need to use data secured by virtual networks, you can use a virtual network (VNet) data gateway.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">To ensure that row-level security (RLS) works on datasets published to the Power BI service, you need to add members to RLS roles in the Power BI service. You can also test <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_200"></span>roles in the Power BI service in a way similar to how you test them Power BI Desktop. RLS only works for dataset readers, and it won’t work for contributing workspace members.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Datasets can be shared individually, through an app, or through a workspace. Shared datasets can be used to build reports and dashboards in other workspaces. To track the usage of shared datasets, you can perform a dataset impact analysis.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Global settings for files can be changed in Power BI Desktop, whereas report-specific settings can be applied both in Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">You can collaborate on developing Power BI content in workspaces. Creating a workspace requires a Power BI Pro license.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Four roles are available in Power BI workspaces, listed from least to most privileged: Viewer, Contributor, Member, Admin. Row-level security only works on viewers; other roles can see all data within a workspace and RLS won’t apply to them.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">If you want to share content from a workspace with end users, it’s best to publish an app. An app includes the workspace content that you select, except for datasets and dataflows. You can customize the navigation of an app further by renaming, reordering, and grouping content items. You can also add links to an app. After you publish an app, you can update or unpublish it.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">You can publish a report from Power BI Desktop. Alternatively, from the Power BI service, you can upload a local file or a file from OneDrive or SharePoint.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Sensitivity labels allow you to show users the level of confidentiality of each workspace item. To be able to apply sensitivity labels, the information protection settings must be enabled by your Power BI tenant admin.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">You can subscribe yourself and others to report pages, dashboards, and paginated reports. Only the person who created a subscription can manage it.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">You can endorse Power BI content by promoting or certifying it to denote that it is high-quality and reliable. Any user with at least the Contributor role in a workspace can promote content that resides in the workspace. Power BI content can be certified only by those who were selected by Power BI tenant admins to certify content, which signifies a higher status of endorsement. Endorsed content has specific badges next to it to differentiate it from other content.</p></li>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5">Thought experiment answers</h3>
<p class="answer"><span class="gray"><strong><a id="ch04que1a" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04que1">1</a>.</strong></span> The answer is <strong>B</strong>. Sharing an app with a security group ensures that users can view only the report you include in the app without exposing other workspace assets. It also minimizes the effort to update the list of viewers because you can update the security group membership, which will be used for the Power BI app access. Sharing an app with individual users, as option A suggests, comes close, but adding or removing viewers will require opening the Power BI website and is not considered best practice. For similar reasons, option C is incorrect; additionally, if you share reports individually as opposed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_202"></span>to packaging them in an app, then accessing them will be more difficult for users because they won’t be in one place. If you give users the Viewer role in a workspace—option D—they’ll see all reports in the workspace. This does not satisfy the business requirements because some reports in the workspace aren’t ready to be shared yet.</p>
<p class="answer"><span class="gray"><strong><a id="ch04que2a" href="ch04.xhtml#ch04que2">2</a>.</strong></span> The answer is <strong>C</strong>. Contributors can update reports in a workspace, and they can update the app when allowed in workspace settings; at the same time, contributors cannot add others to a workspace. Options A and B both suggest roles that can add other users to a workspace, which goes against the business requirements. Option D, Viewer, isn’t right because viewers cannot update reports or apps in a workspace.</p>
