<h2 class="h2a">Visualize and analyze the data</h2>
<p class="noindent">So far, we’ve reviewed the skills necessary to prepare and model the data to lay the foundation you need before visualizing the data, the topic of this chapter. Data visualization is a key element of Power BI, and you need effective data visualization to create effective reports. This step becomes the foundation for data analysis, also covered in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">In Power BI, you can create reports and dashboards to visualize data. One of the things that sets Power BI apart from other visualization tools is that you can create interactive reports—that is, the visuals that can interact with each other by cross-filtering the underlying data.</p>
<p class="indent">We start this chapter by reviewing the skills necessary to create reports in Power BI. We then cover how to design and configure a report for accessibility and how to set up page refresh options. We then review how to set up and create dashboards—visuals from multiple reports that can be pinned to a dashboard to create a single screen with the most important visual elements. Finally, we explore the rich set of features designed to improve report usability.</p>
<p class="object-title">Skills covered in this chapter:</p>

<section>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec1">Skill 3.1: Create reports</h3>
<p class="noindent">A Power BI report can be based on only one dataset, and a report may have several pages. Reports can be authored both in Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service.</p>
<p class="indent">We start this section by reviewing various visualization items and formatting options available for Power BI reports. We also cover configuring the layout of pages and making reports accessible to users.</p>
<p class="object-title">This skill covers how to:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">Add visualization items to reports</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Choose an appropriate visualization type</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112"></span>Format and configure visualizations</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Use a custom visual</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Apply and customize a theme</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Configure conditional formatting</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Apply slicing and filtering</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Configure the report page</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Use the Analyze in Excel feature</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Choose when to use a paginated report</p></li>
</ul>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec1">Add visualization items to reports</h4>
<p class="noindent">Power BI provides several ways to add a visual to a report page:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">Select a visual icon from the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Select the check box next to a field in the <strong>Fields</strong> pane.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Drag a field from the <strong>Fields</strong> pane onto the canvas.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Select <strong>New visual</strong> on the <strong>Insert</strong> ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Turn a Q&amp;A result into a standard visual.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">We describe how to choose an appropriate visualization type in the next section. You can also import nonstandard visuals known as <em>custom visuals</em>, which we review later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to visuals, there are a few other options in Power BI that visualize data, provide information, and improve the usability of your report available on the Insert ribbon:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Text box</strong> Can hold formatted text, including hyperlinks</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Buttons</strong> Can be formatted differently for various states, such as on hover or on press</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Shapes</strong> Similar to buttons, but the look and formatting options are different</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Image</strong> A shape that contains an image</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Buttons, shapes, and images can be set to perform the following actions:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Back</strong> Takes a user back to the previous page; especially relevant after performing drill-through</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Bookmark</strong> Takes a user to a bookmark you specify</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Page navigation</strong> Takes a user to a specific report page</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Q&amp;A</strong> Launches a Q&amp;A pop-up that can only process natural language queries without any extra functionality provided by the Q&amp;A visual</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Web URL</strong> Takes a user to the specified web URL</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Buttons can also perform <em>drill-through</em>, which takes a user to a specific page while carrying the applied filters from the original page. We review the drill-through functionality toward the end of this chapter.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_113"></span>Choose an appropriate visualization type</h4>
<p class="noindent">Besides the Table and Matrix visuals, which we used earlier in the book, Power BI offers over 30 built-in visuals. You can see a fragment of the Visualizations pane in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig01">Figure 3-1</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig01">
<img src="graphics/03fig01.jpg" alt="The figure shows the icons of the standard visuals available in Power BI Desktop." width="300" height="351"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-1</strong> Standard visuals in Power BI.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In this section, we review the visuals and show you how to choose an appropriate visual based on your objectives.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="tip-title"><img src="graphics/tip.jpg" alt="images" width="55" height="55"/> <em><span class="gray">Exam Tip</span></em></p>
<p class="tip-para">You should be able to select the right visual for comparing parts to whole, across categories and time, and spatially.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title"><span class="gray"><em>Note</em></span> Companion File</p>
<p class="note-para">You can find all visuals from this section in the 3.1 Reports.pbix file in the companion files folder.</p>

<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec51">Bar charts</h5>
<p class="noindent">Power BI has six variations of <em>bar charts</em>:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">Stacked bar chart</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Stacked column chart</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Clustered bar chart</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Clustered column chart</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">100% stacked bar chart</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">100% stacked column chart</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_114"></span>All six charts have the same four field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Axis</strong> Columns to be placed on the horizontal or vertical axis. When using more than one column, users can drill down to the next field.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Legend</strong> The categorical column used to color items.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Values</strong> One or more numerical fields to be plotted; if you use a legend, you can put only one field into this field well.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> Additional fields that users can see in the tooltip when they hover over a bar or a column. The default tooltips will be shown when you hover over the bars or columns.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You can see the various bar charts in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig02">Figure 3-2</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig02">
<img src="graphics/03fig02.jpg" alt="The figure shows all six bar chart variations." width="732" height="384"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-2</strong> Bar charts.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">It is best to use bar or column charts when you are comparing values across categories. This is because you can directly compare the values against each other. If you want to compare values across time, use a line or area chart, covered next.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec52">Line and area charts</h5>
<p class="noindent">Power BI has a <em>line chart</em> and two types of <em>area charts</em>:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">Line chart</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Area chart</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Stacked area chart</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">These charts have the following common field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Axis</strong> Columns to be placed on the horizontal axis. When using more than one column, users can drill down.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Legend</strong> The categorical column used to color items.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_115"></span><strong>Values</strong> One or more numerical fields to be plotted; if the chart has a legend, you can use only one field for values.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> Additional fields that users can see in the tooltip when they hover over a bar or column.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Area charts are similar to the line chart but have a shaded area under the lines. Additionally, the line and area charts have the Secondary values field well, which allows you to use a secondary y-axis if you’re not using the Legend field well.</p>
<p class="indent">The three visuals are shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig03">Figure 3-3</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig03">
<img src="graphics/03fig03.jpg" alt="The figure shows the line chart, area chart, and stacked area chart." width="733" height="190"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-3</strong> Line and area charts.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Line and area charts are best used when you want to show historical trends or compare values across time. If you use a secondary y-axis, you should make it clear which line belongs to which axis by including axis titles to avoid confusion.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec53">Combo charts</h5>
<p class="noindent">There are two <em>combo charts</em> in Power BI:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">Line and stacked column chart</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Line and clustered column chart</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Both have the same five field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Shared axis</strong> Columns to be placed on the horizontal axis. When using more than one column, you can drill down.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Column series</strong> Similar to a legend; one column may be used.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Column values</strong> One or more numerical fields to be plotted; if you have a column series, you can use only one field.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Line values</strong> One or more numerical fields to be plotted as lines.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> Additional fields that users can see in the tooltip when they hover over a bar or column.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You can see both charts in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig04">Figure 3-4</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig04">
<img src="graphics/03fig04.jpg" alt="The figure shows the line and stacked column chart and the line and clustered column chart." width="733" height="282"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-4</strong> Combo charts.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116"></span>Combo charts can be the appropriate choice when you plot two fields that have different value ranges and you want to use a legend for one of them. For instance, you could plot Profit and Quantity by Year, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig04">Figure 3-4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">By default, the column values appear on the right and the line values appear on the left. In the Format settings, you can switch the axes, as well as hide one or the other, which will align the axes.</p>
<p class="indent">Combo charts allow you to show line markers and set the line width to 0, which makes them suitable for comparing values across categories and time, and not only time.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec54">Ribbon chart</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <em>ribbon chart</em> is like a column chart with ribbons between the columns used to highlight changes in the relative ranking of categorical items. The item with the highest ranking will be displayed on top.</p>
<p class="indent">The chart has four field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Axis</strong> Columns to be placed on the horizontal axis. When using more than one column, you can drill down.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Legend</strong> The categorical column used to color items.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Values</strong> One or more numerical fields to be plotted; if you use a legend, you can use one field only.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> Additional fields that users can see in the tooltip when they hover over a bar or column.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Tooltips in ribbon visuals will show additional information compared to the visuals we have covered thus far. When you hover over the ribbons between columns, you’ll see how the values changed between two columns. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig05">Figure 3-5</a> shows the ribbon chart and the tooltips when you hover over a ribbon.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig05">
<img src="graphics/03fig05.jpg" alt="The figure shows the Ribbon chart." width="650" height="333"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-5</strong> Ribbon chart.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_117"></span>The ribbon chart is suitable when you want to show the progression of ranking changes between different categories across time.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec55">Waterfall chart</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <em>waterfall chart</em> shows color-coded values in a running total fashion. By default, positive values are green and negative values red. This visual has four field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Category</strong> Columns to be placed on the horizontal axis, where each item is a stage. When using more than one column, you can drill down.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Breakdown</strong> You can use one column here to show changes between categories.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Values</strong> One numerical field to be plotted.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> Additional fields that users can see in the tooltip when they hover over a bar or column.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">When you’re using the breakdown field well, hovering over a breakdown item will show the change between two categorical items. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig06">Figure 3-6</a> shows the waterfall chart and the tooltips when you hover over a breakdown item.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig06">
<img src="graphics/03fig06.jpg" alt="The figure shows two waterfall charts: one with and one without breakdown." width="733" height="222"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-6</strong> Waterfall charts.</p>
</figure>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_118"></span><span class="gray"><em>Important</em></span> Waterfall Total</p>
<p class="note-para">Be aware that the total column in a waterfall chart is the sum of the categories in the visual, not the total that you would see without filtering the categories. This behavior is especially relevant with semi-additive or non-additive measures, such as balances or averages.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">When you use the breakdown field well, only the top five items are shown by default, with the rest grouped into Other. The Other group is yellow by default because it may contain both Increase and Decrease items. You can change the colors, as well as the number of breakdown items, in the <strong>Format</strong> pane.</p>
<p class="indent">A waterfall chart is a good choice when you want to show what caused the most significant changes between time periods. The chart may also be appropriate to illustrate what the total amount is made of while showing the total at the same time for comparison.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec56">Funnel</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <em>funnel chart</em> is like a bar chart with bars centered, and it has three field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Group</strong> For one or more categorical columns, where each item is a stage. When using more than one column, you can drill down.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Values</strong> One numerical field to be plotted.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> Additional fields that users can see in the tooltip when they hover over a bar or column.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">When you hover over a categorical item in a funnel chart, you see a tooltip with the proportion that category makes up of the first and previous items. It also shows the size of the last item relative to the first one. In <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig07">Figure 3-7</a> you can see the funnel chart used with tooltips showing.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig07">
<img src="graphics/03fig07.jpg" alt="The figure shows a funnel chart and a tooltip that is shown when you hover over a bar." width="450" height="332"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-7</strong> Funnel chart.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_119"></span>Because of this additional information in the tooltips, a funnel chart can be a proper choice for showing values by stages. This visual can also be used for revealing bottlenecks in a process or tracking workflow.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec57">Scatter chart</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <em>scatter chart</em> can visualize two or more metrics for categorical items. Each item will be plotted according to the x- and y-coordinates, which will be taken from the metrics. When you use a third metric for size, the chart can be called a <em>bubble chart</em>. You can also create a dot plot by using a categorical column on the x-axis.</p>
<p class="indent">The visual has the following field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Details</strong> You can use one or more categorical columns in this field well to plot points. When using more than one column, you can drill down.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Legend</strong> A categorical column used to color items.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>X-axis</strong> One field to be placed on the horizontal axis.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Y-axis</strong> One numerical field to be placed on the vertical axis.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Size</strong> For one numerical field to be used for relative bubble sizing.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Play axis</strong> You can use a column here, which is usually a time-series column such as Year or Date.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> Additional fields that users can see in the tooltip when they hover over a bar or column.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">An example of a scatter chart is shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig08">Figure 3-8</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig08">
<img src="graphics/03fig08.jpg" alt="The figure shows a scatter chart." width="575" height="328"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-8</strong> Scatter chart.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">A scatter chart can be an effective way to show a relationship between two metrics or to highlight outliers.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec58"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_120"></span>Pie and donut charts</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <em>pie</em> <em>chart</em> and the <em>donut chart</em> are the same except the latter has empty space in the middle. Both charts have the same four field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Legend</strong> For one or more categorical columns used to color items. When using more than one column, you can drill down.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Details</strong> Each slice may be split by a categorical column used here.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Values</strong> You may use one or more numerical fields here; if you show Details, you are limited to one field only.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> Additional fields that users can see in the tooltip when they hover over a bar or column.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">When hovering over a slice, you’ll see the proportion it makes up. You can see both pie and donut charts in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig09">Figure 3-9</a>, with a tooltip showing for an item in the donut chart.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig09">
<img src="graphics/03fig09.jpg" alt="The figure shows a Pie and a Donut chart with tooltips over the Donut chart." width="733" height="281"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-9</strong> Pie and donut charts.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">You can use either of these charts to show the relationships of parts to the whole. Both charts are not considered best practice in data visualization with one exception: you may use a pie or a donut chart when there are only two categories. Otherwise, if you are sure that users will not be comparing parts to each other, only to the whole, you may also use these charts. Be aware that having too many items in such a chart will make reading it difficult and take up a lot of real estate in your report. Using donut charts in addition to a card visual in the center of the donut may be helpful.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec59">Treemap</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <em>treemap chart</em>  can be thought of as rectangular pie chart because it also shows the relationship of parts to the whole. You can nest rectangles to further divide the whole. There are four field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Group</strong> For one or more categorical columns that will define the relative size of rectangles. When using more than one column, you can drill down.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Details</strong> Each rectangle can be split by the categorical column used here.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_121"></span><strong>Values</strong> One or more numerical fields to be plotted; if you show Details, you are limited to one field only.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> Additional fields that users can see in the tooltip when they hover over a bar or column.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Unlike the pie and donut charts, the treemap chart does not show percentages in tooltips by default. You can see a treemap chart in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig10">Figure 3-10</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig10">
<img src="graphics/03fig10.jpg" alt="The figure shows a treemap chart." width="733" height="367"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-10</strong> Treemap chart.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The rectangles in a treemap chart are arranged top to bottom and left to right based on numerical values in descending order.</p>
<p class="indent">A treemap visual can be a good choice when you want to show proportions between each part and the whole, as well as highlight the most important contributors and outliers.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec60">Maps</h5>
<p class="noindent">Power BI has several options when it comes to visualizing geospatial data. In this section, we review two map visuals: <em>Map</em> and <em>Filled map</em> (also known as a <em>choropleth</em> map). Each of these visuals has the following field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Location</strong> One or more categorical columns that contain locations to be plotted; you can drill down when you use two or more columns.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Legend</strong> You can use a column here to color items.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Latitude</strong> One field can be used here.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Longitude</strong> One field can be used here.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> Additional fields that users can see in the tooltip when they hover over a bar or column.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122"></span>Additionally, the Map visual can use the Size field well for different bubble sizes based on a numerical field. If you are using the legend with the Map visual, your bubbles will be turned into pie charts.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title"><span class="gray"><em>Note</em></span> Mapping Accuracy</p>
<p class="note-para">To improve the accuracy of maps, you can geocode your fields by selecting an appropriate data category in field properties.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see the Map and Filled map visuals in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig11">Figure 3-11</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig11">
<img src="graphics/03fig11.jpg" alt="The figure shows the Map and Filled map visuals." width="732" height="270"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-11</strong> Map and Filled map.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Maps are effective when you’re working with spatial data and showing the geographical distribution of values. Power BI will automatically zoom to show the most data based on the size of the visual. You should ensure that users are able to see all fields by using color coding and by choosing between a Map and a Filled map. For example, in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig11">Figure 3-11</a> the External sales territory is easily seen in the Map visual but virtually impossible to notice in the Filled map.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec61">Gauge</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <em>gauge chart</em> can be thought of as one half of a donut chart that compares a value to a target or a maximum value. The gauge chart has five field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Value</strong> For a numerical field; displayed in the center.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Minimum value</strong> A numerical field may be used as the start of the scale.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Maximum value</strong> A numerical field may be used as the end of the scale.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Target value</strong> You can use one numerical field here, which is displayed as a line/needle on the gauge.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> Additional fields that users can see in the tooltip when they hover over a bar or column.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You can see an example of a gauge chart in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig12">Figure 3-12</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig12">
<img src="graphics/03fig12.jpg" alt="The figure shows a gauge visual." width="325" height="199"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-12</strong> Gauge chart.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_123"></span>Although the gauge visual will be displayed with any of the field wells filled, it should at least have a field in the Value field well. By default, the visual sets the minimum at 0 and the maximum at double the amount of Value, so it will be half-filled.</p>
<p class="indent">The gauge is best used to track KPIs or targets, especially those with known maximum values, such as proportions. Other visuals can be used to track key performance indicators (KPIs), which we cover next.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec62">Card, multi-row card, and KPI</h5>
<p class="noindent">Besides the gauge visual, there are three other related visuals that can be used to display KPIs. The card visual has a single field well that accepts one field of any type, and it only displays one value.</p>
<p class="indent">The multi-row card visual also has a single field well, but it can accept multiple fields. If at least one of the fields is of type Text, then values are divided into rows, with one row per category.</p>
<p class="indent">The KPI visual has three field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Indicator</strong> For a numerical field; displayed in the center</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Trend axis</strong> For a column, preferably one that contains time-series data like year or date</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Target goals</strong> For one or two numerical fields against which the indicator is compared</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The KPI visual displays its values for the last item on the trend axis, which is different from the total value across the whole trend axis.</p>
<p class="indent">You can see all three visuals in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig13">Figure 3-13</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig13">

<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-13</strong> Card, multi-row card, and KPI visuals.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_124"></span>The card visual is best used when there’s only one value to display.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to compare a value against one or two targets, it’s best to use the KPI visual, which can also display a trend in the background. The trend itself contains limited information and is only useful for high-level analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">When you want to display several metrics across a category, you may want to use the multi-row card. It’s also a good choice for displaying several unrelated metrics at once.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title"><span class="gray"><em>Note</em></span> Performance Considerations</p>
<p class="note-para">Although this is outside the scope of the exam, the more visuals you have on a page, the slower it will be. If you have several card visuals on a page, consider using the multi-row card visual or even a table to reduce the number of visuals.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec63">Artificial intelligence visuals</h5>
<p class="noindent">As of this writing, Power BI has the following generally available artificial intelligence visuals:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Key influencers</strong> Helps users understand the main drivers behind a metric and compare the importance of the drivers</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Decomposition tree</strong> Allows users to perform the root cause analysis or interactive drill-down</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Q&amp;A</strong> Answers natural language queries visually</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">We review the key influencers and decomposition tree visuals separately in Skill 3.4: Identify patterns and trends. For the Q&amp;A visual, refer to Skill 2.2: Develop a data model.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec3">Format and configure visualizations</h4>
<p class="noindent">Power BI allows you to format all visuals in various ways so that you can design an effective report. To see the formatting options of a visual, select the visual and then select <strong>Format</strong> (paintbrush icon) on the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane.</p>
<p class="indent">Many visuals have some formatting options that are unique to them, but most visuals have these options in common:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>General</strong> In this section, you can specify x-position, y-position, width, height, and alt text (a description that will be read by a screen reader on selecting the visual).</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Title</strong> Title text, word wrap, font color, background color, alignment, text size, and font family.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Background</strong> Background color and transparency.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Lock aspect</strong> If enabled, when you adjust the size of a visual manually, its aspect will be locked.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Border</strong> Border color and radius.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Shadow</strong> Shadow color, position, and preset.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_125"></span><strong>Tooltips</strong> In this section you can choose to use the default tooltip type or to use a specific report page as a tooltip. For default tooltips, you can format the label and value colors, text size, font family, background color, and transparency.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Visual header</strong> This section allows you to hide the whole visual header or some of its elements. Additionally, you can format its background, border, and icon colors, as well as transparency. You can also add a visual header tooltip icon here.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Some properties can be formatted conditionally, which we review later in this chapter.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">Use a custom visual</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to built-in visuals, Power BI offers a way to use <em>custom visuals</em>, or visuals created by using the Power BI SDK. There are two main ways to import a custom visual in Power BI Desktop:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">AppSource</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">From a file</p></li>
</ul>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec64">AppSource</h5>
<p class="noindent">First, you may import a visual from AppSource, which you can do in one of two ways:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">In the <strong>Report</strong> view, select <strong>Insert</strong> &gt; <strong>More visuals</strong> &gt; <strong>From AppSource</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Select the ellipsis on the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane, then select <strong>Get more visuals</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Either way, you will see the options shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig14">Figure 3-14</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig14">
<img src="graphics/03fig14.jpg" alt="The figure shows a list of categories of visuals and a list of suggested visuals." width="732" height="409"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-14</strong> Power BI visuals from AppSource.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126"></span>In addition to AppSource, which offers publicly available visuals, the Power BI administrator of your organization may add some organizational visuals, which you can select from the <strong>My organization</strong> section.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec65">From a file</h5>
<p class="noindent">As an alternative to AppSource, you can import a visual from a PBIVIZ file in one of two ways:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">In the <strong>Report</strong> view, select <strong>Insert</strong> &gt; <strong>More visuals</strong> &gt; <strong>From my files</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Select the ellipsis on the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane, then select <strong>Import visual from a file</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Either way, before you can import a visual, you may see the caution shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig15">Figure 3-15</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig15">
<img src="graphics/03fig15.jpg" alt="The caution says: “Custom visuals aren't provided by Microsoft and could contain security or privacy risks. Only import a custom visual if you trust its author and source.”" width="525" height="254"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-15</strong> Import custom visual caution.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">To import a visual, select <strong>Import</strong>. You may also prevent this caution from appearing again by selecting the <strong>Don’t show this dialog again</strong> option.</p>
<p class="indent">After you import a visual from AppSource or a file, the imported visual will then become available in the Visualizations pane.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5">Apply and customize a theme</h4>
<p class="noindent">In many environments, there’s a preferred color palette or a way to format visuals. While you can format each visual individually, you can also apply a theme to the whole report, which can save a lot of time. Power BI Desktop has several prebuilt themes, which you can see in the <strong>View</strong> tab of the ribbon, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig16">Figure 3-16</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig16">
<img src="graphics/03fig16.jpg" alt="The figure shows the View tab of the ribbon in Power BI Desktop with themes list expanded." width="575" height="780"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-16</strong> Themes in Power BI Desktop.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Besides the prebuilt themes, you can import a Power BI report theme file by selecting <strong>Browse for themes</strong>, which will prompt you to select a JSON file.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also select <strong>Customize current theme</strong> to customize your theme without writing any code by using the user interface, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig17">Figure 3-17</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig17">
<img src="graphics/03fig17.jpg" alt="The figure shows the View tab of the ribbon in Power BI Desktop with themes list expanded." width="733" height="635"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-17</strong> Themes in Power BI Desktop.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_127"></span>Once you make your changes, select <strong>Apply</strong> to save the theme. If you’re using a custom theme, you can export it from Power BI Desktop for future use by selecting <strong>Save current theme</strong> and saving the theme’s JSON file.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title"><span class="gray"><em>Need More Review?</em></span> Power BI Theme Files</p>
<p class="note-para">The user interface allows you to customize fewer properties compared to a JSON theme. The details on how to create a JSON theme file are outside the scope of this book.

<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_128"></span>Configure conditional formatting</h4>
<p class="noindent">Some formatting properties can be specified based on a condition, also known as expression-based formatting.</p>
<p class="indent">If a property can be formatted conditionally, it will have an <em>fx</em> icon next to it, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig18">Figure 3-18</a>, where conditional formatting can be applied to <strong>Title text</strong> and <strong>Font color</strong>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig18">
<img src="graphics/03fig18.jpg" alt="There is an fx button next to font color." width="250" height="347"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-18</strong> Conditional formatting icons.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_129"></span>For example, if you select the icon next to <strong>Font color</strong>, you’ll see options like those in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig19">Figure 3-19</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig19">
<img src="graphics/03fig19.jpg" alt="There are the following drop-down lists: Format style, What field should we base this on, Summarization, How should we format empty values, Minimum, and Maximum. There's also the Add a middle color option." width="732" height="518"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-19</strong> Conditional formatting options.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">You will see different options depending on the property you’re formatting. For instance, when you’re configuring the color, you’ll see the following options in the <strong>Format style</strong> list:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Gradient</strong> Suitable for continuous color gradients. You can select a field based on which you want to set the color. You can enter the minimum and maximum values for the field and set the corresponding colors. If you want a center color, you can select the <strong>Add a middle color</strong> option, and you can specify the corresponding value, too.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Rules</strong> This option is suitable for discrete colors with no gradients between them. As with the color scale, you can select a field on which you want to base your color. You can then assign colors to value ranges, specific numbers, or blank values.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Field value</strong> When you have a field that returns a color code, you can use this option. A color value can be in any of the following formats:</p>
<ul class="sq">
<li><p class="bull">3-, 6-, or 8-digit hex code, like #ABC123</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">RGB or RGBA value, like RGB(10, 20, 30)</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">HSL or HSLA value, like HSLA(10, 50%, 50%, 0.75)</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Color name, like <em>red</em> or <em>green</em></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_130"></span>When formatting a property other than color, make sure that the field you select returns values in the expected format.</p>
<p class="indent">Some formatting properties won’t support all Format by options. For example, for Title text, you can only use the <strong>Field value</strong> option, because title text can only be a text string.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to remove conditional formatting for a property, select the eraser icon next to it.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec7">Apply slicing and filtering</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the core features of Power BI is allowing report users to apply filters and see the values change in an instant. Filters can be applied in the following two ways:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">Slicers</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Filters pane</p></li>
</ul>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec66">Slicers</h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Slicers</em> are visuals that can apply filters to other visuals. Importantly, slicers accept only columns as fields to filter by. You can configure slicers in various ways depending on the data type of the column(s) you use.</p>
<p class="indent">Any slicer can be displayed as List or Dropdown. You can add a search bar to a List or Dropdown slicer by hovering over it and selecting <strong>More options</strong> (the ellipsis) &gt; <strong>Search</strong>. This is especially useful when you have a number of options within the slicer. Additionally, in the <strong>Selection controls</strong> section of the <strong>Format</strong> pane, you can do the following:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">Force a single selection.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Select whether the Ctrl key is required for multiple selections.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Show the <strong>Select all</strong> option.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You can create a Hierarchy slicer by using multiple columns from one or more related tables. Non-hierarchical List slicers specifically can have a vertical (default) or horizontal orientation as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, a slicer that uses a numeric column can also be displayed as:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Between</strong> Applies the lower and upper limits for values, inclusive</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Less than or equal to</strong> Sets the upper limit for values, inclusive</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Greater than or equal to</strong> Sets the lower limit for values, inclusive</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">A slicer that uses a date/time column can also be displayed as:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Between</strong> Sets the start and end date/time values, inclusive.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Before</strong> Sets the end date/time value, inclusive.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>After</strong> Sets the start date/time value, inclusive.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Relative Date</strong> This option can filter for one or more periods, such as days or months, before or after today’s date. It can also filter for the current period.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_131"></span><strong>Relative Time</strong> Same as the Relative Date option but for time periods such as minutes or hours.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You can see examples of various slicers in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig20">Figure 3-20</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig20">
<img src="graphics/03fig20.jpg" alt="The figure shows List, Drop-down, Hierarchical, Relative Date, and Between slicers." width="733" height="256"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-20</strong> Various types of slicers.</p>
</figure>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title"><span class="gray"><em>Note</em></span> Ignoring Filters From Slicers</p>
<p class="note-para">If you want some visuals to ignore a certain slicer, you can configure the interaction between them. This is covered later in this chapter in Skill 3.3: Enhance reports for usability and storytelling.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">To clear a slicer selection, select the <strong>Clear selections</strong> (eraser) icon on the slicer header that becomes visible when you hover over the slicer.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s possible to filter the values in a slicer. For this, you need to apply a visual-level filter in the Filters pane, which is covered next.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec67">Filters pane</h5>
<p class="noindent">Besides slicers, you can apply filters by using the Filters pane on the right-hand side of the report, which has three sections:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Filters on this visual</strong> These filters apply to a specific visual you select, and this section is visible only when you select a visual. You can use both measures and columns to filter on. Fields that are used in field wells of a visual will automatically appear here.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Filters on this page</strong> These filters apply to all visuals on the currently selected page. It’s not possible to make certain visuals ignore these filters, and you can only use columns to filter on.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Filters on all pages</strong> These filters apply to all visuals in the report across all pages. You can’t make specific visuals ignore these filters, and you can only use columns to filter on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You can see the Filters pane in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig21">Figure 3-21</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig21">
<img src="graphics/03fig21.jpg" alt="The figure shows three sections. There's an inactive filter on Color on a visual, and there's an active filter on Sales Territory on all pages. The filter is named Sales Territory is Southwest." width="250" height="592"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-21</strong> Filters pane.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_132"></span>Filters in the Filters pane are shown as filter cards. Cards with applied filters are shaded. In <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig21">Figure 3-21</a>, the Sales Territory filter card is shaded because it’s filtered to one value: Southwest. There are no filters on Color in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig21">Figure 3-21</a>, so the card is not shaded.</p>
<p class="indent">You can add a field to the Filters pane in one of two ways:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">Drag a field from the <strong>Fields</strong> pane into a section in the <strong>Filters</strong> pane.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Right-click a field in the <strong>Fields</strong> pane and select <strong>Add to filters</strong>, and then select the section you want to add the field to.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You can apply Basic filtering to any column, which corresponds to the List option in slicers. You can also select the <strong>Require single selection</strong> option if you want users to select only one value.</p>
<p class="indent">Depending on the data type of the field you’re adding, you’ll see different Advanced filtering options you can apply. For example, for Date/Time type columns, you have the option of filtering in a relative or a static time period, such as filtering for the last two calendar weeks. For Text type columns, you can filter when a column contains a certain value.</p>
<p class="indent">As with slicers, selections in a filter card can be cleared by selecting the <strong>Clear filter</strong> button that becomes visible when you hover over the filter card. Other buttons that become visible when you hover over a filter card include the following:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133"></span><strong>Lock filter</strong> This locks the filter selections, preventing report viewers from changing them. To unlock the filter, select the <strong>Filter locked</strong> button.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Hide filter</strong> This hides the filter card from report viewers.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Remove filter</strong> This removes a filter card; not available for fields that are used in visuals.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title"><span class="gray"><em>Note</em></span> Locking and Hiding Filters</p>
<p class="note-para">Locking and hiding filters works only when you’re viewing a report published to the Power BI service. We review skills related to the Power BI service in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, “Deploy and maintain assets.”</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title"><span class="gray"><em>Note</em></span> Filtering Filter Cards</p>
<p class="note-para">A common technique to show a reduced number of values in a filter card is to add the same field twice and then filter and hide one of the cards. Removing one filter card does not remove the other.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can search for filters in the Filters pane in the same way you search in the Fields pane. You can also sort and reorder the filter cards.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always check which filters affect a certain visual by hovering over its filter button on the visual header, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig22">Figure 3-22</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig22">

</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec8">Configure the report page</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can change various page properties by selecting the Format pane after making sure that no visual is selected. You will then see the following sections:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Page information</strong> You can change the page name here, as well as allow the page to be used as a tooltip or a Q&amp;A answer, or both. If you choose to use the page as a Q&amp;A answer, you can add alternate names for it, similar to adding synonyms for fields.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_134"></span><strong>Canvas settings</strong> Here you can set the vertical alignment—Top or Middle—as well as select one of the preset sizes or specify a custom size in pixels. The preset sizes are as follows:</p>
<ul class="sq1">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>16:9</strong> (1280 by 720 pixels)</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>4:3</strong> (960 by 720 pixels)</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Letter</strong> (816 by 1056 pixels)</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltip</strong> (320 by 240 pixels)</p></li></ul></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Canvas background</strong> You can select a background color and specify the transparency, or you can choose a background image, specify the transparency, and select how to scale it:</p>
<ul class="sq1">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Normal</strong> Displays the image in its original size.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Fit</strong> Stretches the image to canvas size without keeping proportions.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Fill</strong> Stretches the image to touch the canvas from inside, keeping proportions.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Wallpaper</strong> This is similar to a page background, except that it also covers the area outside of the page. Wallpaper comes into play when you embed a report and its size does not match the embed area, so you’ll see the wallpaper outside of the report area.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Filter pane</strong> You can format the Filter pane here by selecting various colors and sizes.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Filter cards</strong> In addition to the Filter pane, you can format filter cards. You can format the available and applied filter cards separately.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">If you usually format your pages in certain ways, you may want to format a page once and then duplicate it to create new pages instead of formatting new pages. In corporate environments, you may also want to use a selected company background image so that reports across an organization are consistent.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec9">Use the Analyze in Excel feature</h4>
<p class="noindent">Power BI isn’t the only tool you can use to visualize data from Power BI datasets—you can use other tools, including Microsoft Excel. Once connected to a Power BI dataset in Excel, you can use PivotTables, slicers, charts, and cube formulas to analyze your data.</p>
<p class="indent">One way to connect Excel to a Power BI dataset is by opening a dataset in Power BI service, then selecting <strong>Analyze in Excel</strong>. This will download an Excel file connected to your Power BI dataset with a PivotTable pre-created for you. After you open the Excel file, you may have to select Enable Editing or Enable Content, or both, depending on your security settings.</p>
<p class="indent">After you interact with your Power BI data in Excel, you can save your workbook and share it with others. People who open the workbook will see the data as you saved it, which may not be the latest. To get the latest data, you will need to select <strong>Data</strong> &gt; <strong>Refresh All</strong> in Excel, which may require signing in to their account.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_135"></span><span class="gray"><em>Note</em></span> Analyze In Excel and Security</p>
<p class="note-para">Row-level security is applied when using Analyze in Excel. Furthermore, any user who wishes to refresh data in Excel will need the right permissions for the underlying dataset in Power BI service. We review permissions in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec10">Choose when to use a paginated report</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although you can print the reports you create in Power BI Desktop, they’re primarily meant to be used online in Power BI service or mobile apps. Usually, the reports are formatted to fit well on a computer or mobile phone screen, and different report pages often serve different purposes.</p>
<p class="indent">There are valid use cases for printing reports or sharing them outside of the Power BI service. For example, you may want to print a sales performance report that shows each region on a different page and distribute the report before a meeting. For cases like this, a <em>paginated report</em> would be a good fit. Paginated reports allow report designers to create “pixel-perfect” reports since report designers have full control over the layout. Paginated reports can display a full table that would require scrolling in a regular Power BI report.</p>
<p class="indent">Paginated reports are created by using software called Power BI Report Builder. Like normal Power BI reports, paginated reports can be created by using data from various data sources, and you can even use a Power BI service dataset as a data source.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec2">Skill 3.2: Create dashboards</h3>
<p class="noindent">For the most part of this book so far, we’ve worked on building a Power BI report from a single dataset. This in itself can be one of the limitations of a report—it can contain data only from one dataset. There may be a number of scenarios when you want to show users visuals from multiple datasets side by side. To do so, you can display them in a dashboard.</p>
<p class="indent">A Power BI dashboard has only one screen, and it can include visuals from a variety of reports based on data from different datasets. Dashboards can be created only in the Power BI service, and they contain features that are not available in reports, such as data alerts. The visuals within a dashboard are called <em>tiles</em>.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec11">Manage tiles on a dashboard</h4>
<p class="noindent">A dashboard tile can show a pinned visual or a variety of other content, such as text, videos, or hyperlinks, to other reports to make navigation and insights easier for users.</p>
<p class="indent">You can pin tiles from a variety of sources:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">A report</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Another dashboard</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Excel workbook</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Quick insights</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Q&amp;A result</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Paginated report</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">To pin a report visual, hover over it when viewing a report and select <strong>Pin visual</strong> from the visual header. Power BI prompts you to select a dashboard to pin the visual to—you can select an existing dashboard or create a new one, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig23">Figure 3-23</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig23">
<img src="graphics/03fig23.jpg" alt="The figure shows the options available when pinning to dashboard." width="650" height="325"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-23</strong> Pin to dashboard options.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_137"></span>To pin the visual, select <strong>Pin</strong>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title"><span class="gray"><em>Note</em></span> Themes</p>
<p class="note-para">If your report uses a theme, you’ll have the option to keep the report theme or use the dashboard theme. We cover dashboard themes later in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In addition to pinning visuals from the dashboard, you can select <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>Add a tile</strong> to add a tile that contains one of the following:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Web content</strong> Supports any HTML for content embedding.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Image</strong> For publicly accessible images. Access that requires authentication and uploading images aren’t supported.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Text box</strong> For entering static text, which can be formatted.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Video</strong> For videos hosted on YouTube or Vimeo. Videos can be played on the dashboard without leaving the page.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Custom Streaming Data</strong> You can add streaming data sourced from an API, Azure Stream, or PubNub.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">To edit a dashboard tile, hover over it and select <strong>More options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit details</strong>. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig24">Figure 3-24</a> shows the details of a pinned tile.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig24">

<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-24</strong> Tile details.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">For any tile, you can set the title and subtitle. For pinned visuals, you can provide a title and choose to display the last refresh time.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_138"></span>Selecting a pinned tile on a dashboard can take you to the report or workbook it came from. Additionally, for most tiles, you can set a custom link, which can be any external link, a dashboard, or a report in the same workspace as the dashboard.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s important to understand that visuals in tiles aren’t as interactive as report visuals; although you may see tooltips, you can’t cross-filter one tile by selecting an item in another tile. Furthermore, if you make changes to a visual that you previously pinned on a dashboard, the changes aren’t going to be reflected in the corresponding dashboard tile, and you’ll need to pin the visuals again to update the tile.</p>
<p class="indent">To have interactivity in a tile, you must pin a live report page, which is covered later in this chapter.</p>

<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec12">Configure mobile view</h4>
<p class="noindent">A Power BI report has a desktop and mobile layout to cater for different screen sizes. Similarly, a dashboard has a web and a mobile layout (also known as a phone view). <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig25">Figure 3-25</a> shows an example of a dashboard in web view.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig25">
<img src="graphics/03fig25.jpg" alt="The figure shows a dashboard with three tiles." width="733" height="437"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-25</strong> Dashboard in web view.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Because this view may not work well on a phone, you can create a mobile layout to optimize the consumption on a mobile device if you have edit rights to a dashboard. Note that the web view doesn’t change when you create a mobile view. To start creating a mobile layout, select <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>Mobile layout</strong>. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig26">Figure 3-26</a> shows the mobile layout editor.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig26">

<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-26</strong> Dashboard mobile layout editor.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_139"></span>In the mobile layout editor, you can reorder tiles by dragging them around the screen as well as resize tiles by dragging from the lower-right corner. You can also hide a tile from the mobile layout by hovering over a tile and selecting <strong>Hide tile</strong>. To add back a tile from the <strong>Unpinned tiles</strong> pane, hover over a tile and select <strong>Add tile</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">If your dashboard contains several tiles, you may want to show only a few key tiles for users to refer to quickly. You may want to hide all tiles first by selecting <strong>Unpin all tiles</strong> in the top menu; then you can readd the desired tiles one by one. To reset the mobile layout to its original state, select <strong>Reset tiles</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">To go back to the web view, select <strong>Web layout</strong> from the <strong>Mobile layout</strong> list in the upper-right corner.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec13">Use the Q&amp;A feature</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you saw in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, “Model the data,” Power BI has a feature called Q&amp;A, which allows you to ask questions about your data by using natural language queries. Q&amp;A is available in both reports and dashboards.</p>
<p class="indent">To start using Q&amp;A in a dashboard, select <strong>Ask a question about your data</strong> on the dashboard and enter a question. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig27">Figure 3-27</a> shows a sample Q&amp;A result. From there, you can go back to the dashboard by selecting <strong>Exit Q&amp;A</strong>, or you can save the result to the dashboard by selecting <strong>Pin visual</strong>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig27">

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec14">Add a Quick Insights result to a dashboard</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you aren’t sure what to show in your reports or you want to check if you may have missed some insights, you can use the Quick Insights feature in the Power BI service. Power BI will try to build some interesting visualizations from your data automatically, and you can then pin a visual you like to a dashboard.</p>
<p class="indent">You can run Quick Insights on a dataset in the following way:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">In the Power BI service, go to the workspace that contains the dataset you want to get Quick Insights from.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Next to the dataset, select <strong>More options</strong> &gt; <strong>Get quick insights</strong>. If you’ve used the feature on the dataset before, you’ll see the <strong>View insights</strong> option.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Wait for the algorithms to finish running and select <strong>View insights</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">An example of Quick Insights is shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig28">Figure 3-28</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig28">
<img src="graphics/03fig28.jpg" alt="The figure shows tiles and commentary of Quick Insights that Power BI has found." width="733" height="348"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-28</strong> Quick Insights.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_141"></span>Each tile is accompanied by commentary to help you make sense of data. If you like a visualization, you can pin it to a dashboard by selecting <strong>Pin visual</strong>, though the commentary won’t be saved.</p>
<p class="indent">Some visualizations may be insightful, whereas others may be completely meaningless. If you want to optimize your dataset for Quick Insights, you should hide fields with no business meaning, such as keys, so that Quick Insights doesn’t include them. You should also hide fields that contain duplicate information, such as product codes and product names, because duplicate information may lead to repetitive insights.</p>
<p class="indent">When you hover over a Quick Insights result, you can select <strong>Focus mode</strong> to apply filters or find related insights by selecting <strong>Get Insights</strong>. Getting Quick Insights from Quick Insights results is called <em>scoped insights</em>. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig29">Figure 3-29</a> shows an example of related insights.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig29">

<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-29</strong> Scoped insights.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_142"></span>From here, you can review the related insights and pin a visual you find useful. To go back to the initial Quick Insights results, select <strong>Exit Focus mode</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec15">Add a dashboard theme</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can apply a theme to a dashboard similar to how you apply a theme to a report. This technique can be especially beneficial if you want to apply a uniform theme to a dashboard that has visuals from reports with different themes.</p>
<p class="indent">To configure the dashboard theme, select <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>Dashboard theme</strong>. From the dropdown list, select a preconfigured theme, or you can create a custom theme. For example, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig30">Figure 3-30</a> shows the color-blind friendly theme.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig30">
<img src="graphics/03fig30.jpg" alt="The figure shows the dashboard theme options with Color-blind friendly selected from the drop-down list." width="733" height="371"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-30</strong> Dashboard theme options.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If you select <strong>Custom</strong> from the dropdown list, you can set the background image and color, as well as tile background, font color, and opacity, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig31">Figure 3-31</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig31">

<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-31</strong> Custom theme options.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">To set a background image, you must provide a publicly accessible URL, because uploading images isn’t supported.</p>
<p class="indent">You can download the theme you create by selecting <strong>Download JSON theme</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">To add a more sophisticated theme, you can upload your own JSON theme by selecting <strong>Upload JSON theme</strong>.</p>
<div class="note">

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec16"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_143"></span>Pin a live report page to a dashboard</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are a couple of limitations of pinned visuals: they can’t cross-filter and interact with each other, and you can pin only one visual at a time.</p>
<p class="indent">Pinning a live report page to a dashboard overcomes both limitations. You can simultaneously pin multiple visuals on a dashboard, and the visuals then become interactive.</p>
<p class="indent">To pin a live page to a dashboard, go to the desired report page in the Power BI service and select <strong>Pin to a dashboard</strong> from the top menu. Power BI asks you to select a dashboard to pin the page to, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig32">Figure 3-32</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig32">
<img src="graphics/03fig32.jpg" alt="The figure shows the options when pinning a live page." width="733" height="404"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-32</strong> Pin live page.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_144"></span>Selecting <strong>Pin live</strong> will pin the report page to a dashboard as a tile. You can then edit, move, and resize the tile as needed. Note that visuals within the tile are interactive; as with reports, you can use slicers and filter visuals by selecting other visuals.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">Skill 3.3: Enhance reports for usability and storytelling</h3>
<p class="noindent">Power BI reports can be made more user-friendly by adding bookmarks, tooltips, navigation, and interactivity, all of which we review in this section. Taking time to consider usability of your reports when gathering feedback from users can help differentiate between good and great dashboards.</p>
<p class="indent">There are several ways to make insights clearer, such as sorting visuals, configuring the interactions between visuals, and setting up drill-through and drilldown.</p>
<p class="indent">As you saw with dashboards, reports can also be designed for mobile devices, and we finish the chapter by showing how you can adjust reports for consumption on the go.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec17">Configure bookmarks</h4>
<p class="noindent">By using bookmarks in Power BI, you can create compelling data stories and enhance the user experience by creating a step-by-step presentation of key insights, or by hiding and showing certain visuals through the click of a button.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_145"></span>Though one of the defining features of Power BI is its interactivity, in some cases you may prefer to draw the attention of users to specific aspects of your reports. For example, you might want to highlight a certain visual with applied filters that show an interesting insight.</p>
<p class="indent">Bookmarks in Power BI allow you to do exactly that: they let you save the states of your pages and switch between them in presentation mode or by linking to them. Bookmarks can save the following:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">Filters, including cross-filtering and selections in slicers</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Current page</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Objects visibility</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Sort order</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Drill-down level</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">To create a bookmark, open the Bookmarks pane by selecting <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Bookmarks</strong>. Once you apply filters or otherwise achieve the desired state of the page you are on, select <strong>Add</strong> in the Bookmarks pane. The bookmark will then appear in the Bookmarks pane with a default name of <em>Bookmark 1</em> or similar. You can rename a bookmark by double-clicking it or by selecting <strong>More options</strong> (the ellipsis next to a bookmark) and selecting <strong>Rename</strong>. The More options menu also contains the following items:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Update</strong> If you decide to change the state of a bookmark, you can update an existing bookmark instead of creating a new one.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Delete</strong> This option deletes the bookmark.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Group</strong> You can group bookmarks to tidy up the Bookmarks pane—for example, by moving bookmarks from each page into a separate group. This feature is especially useful when you have many bookmarks.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Data</strong> This option determines whether the filter, sort, and drill state of the page is saved in the bookmark. By default, this option is selected. Deselecting it can be useful when you only want to save the visibility of visuals, which is controlled by the Display option.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Display</strong> This option, which is selected by default, determines whether the bookmark saves the visibility of visuals. Clearing the selection can be useful when you only want to change filters with your bookmark without changing the visibility of visuals.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Current page</strong> By default, this option is selected; it determines whether selecting the bookmark takes you to the page where it was created. Deselecting the option can be useful when you want to change a report-level filter without switching to a different page.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>All visuals</strong> This option determines whether the bookmark is applied to all visuals or selected visuals only. By default, a bookmark is applied to all visuals.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Selected visuals</strong> You can create a bookmark and only apply it to the visuals that were selected at the time you created the bookmark. You can select visuals in the canvas pane or in the Selection pane. It is important to note that you cannot use the Selected visuals option to bookmarks that have already been created.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_146"></span>The visibility of visuals, captured by the <strong>Display</strong> option of bookmarks, can be configured in the <strong>Selection</strong> pane, which we review later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">In a bookmark, you can highlight a single visual by selecting <strong>More options</strong> (the ellipsis in the visual header) and selecting <strong>Spotlight</strong>. After you do this, the visual will be highlighted with a shade around it, and the rest of the report canvas will be tinted. You can see this effect in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig33">Figure 3-33</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig33">
<img src="graphics/03fig33.jpg" alt="The figure shows the effect of the Spotlight option." width="733" height="393"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-33</strong> A visual in spotlight.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">At this stage, you can create a bookmark by selecting <strong>Add</strong> in the <strong>Bookmarks</strong> pane. If you created one bookmark before, the new bookmark would be called Bookmark 2, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">To undo the Spotlight effect, you can select any other area on the report canvas or select another visual in the Selection pane.</p>
<p class="indent">After you have created some bookmarks, you can change their order by dragging and dropping them in the Bookmarks pane. When creating multiple bookmarks, make sure that you name each bookmark appropriately and group them where relevant. Note that the Bookmarks pane contains bookmarks from the whole report, not just the current page.</p>
<p class="indent">You can navigate between bookmarks by selecting them in the Bookmarks pane, or you can select the <strong>View</strong> button, which will replace the pages bar at the bottom with the bookmark title bar. Ideally, the order of bookmarks should make sense because some users may navigate the bookmarks by using their keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">When you are in the View mode, also known as presentation mode, you can close or collapse all panes to have more room for your report. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig34">Figure 3-34</a> shows the bookmark title bar in the View mode.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig34">
<img src="graphics/03fig34.jpg" alt="The figure shows the Bookmarks view." width="733" height="393"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-34</strong> View mode.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_147"></span>To exit from the View mode, select <strong>Exit</strong> in the Bookmarks pane, or select <strong>Close</strong> (the cross icon) in the bookmark title bar.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use bookmarks for navigation within a report. Configuring navigation for a report is reviewed later in this chapter.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec18">Create custom tooltips</h4>
<p class="noindent">Most Power BI visuals have default tooltips that show the values for a selected data point. In addition to this, Power BI allows you to set custom tooltips for each visual, which can be useful to provide additional context for a data point and allow you to use your page real estate more effectively.</p>
<p class="indent">Custom tooltips are report pages that you configure to show instead of the default tooltips. They will then dynamically filter to show data relevant to the data point you have hovered over.</p>
<p class="indent">Before you can set custom tooltips, you must create a tooltip page in the following way:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">In the <strong>Report</strong> view, create a new report page by selecting <strong>New page</strong> (the plus sign) on the page navigation bar.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Right-click the new page on the navigation bar and select <strong>Rename Page</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Enter a new name, such as <strong>Trend tooltip</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Go to the <strong>Format</strong> pane of the page, expand <strong>Page information</strong>, and switch the <strong>Allow use as tooltip</strong> toggle to <strong>On</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Still in the <strong>Format</strong> pane, expand <strong>Canvas settings</strong> and select <strong>Tooltip</strong> from the <strong>Type</strong> dropdown list. You can also set a custom page size.</p></li>
<li><p class="num"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_148"></span>Add a visual you want to show in the tooltip. In the Wide World Importers example, you can add a line chart that shows <strong>Profit</strong> by <strong>Year</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Right-click the <strong>Trend tooltip</strong> page in the page navigation bar and select <strong>Hide Page</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">You now have a tooltip page, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig35">Figure 3-35</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig35">

<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-35</strong> Trend tooltip.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">You can now assign the custom tooltip to a visual of your choice by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">On a different page, create a bar chart that shows <strong>Profit</strong> by <strong>Employee</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">In the <strong>Format</strong> pane for the new visual, expand <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Tooltips</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Ensure <strong>Report page</strong> is selected from the <strong>Type</strong> dropdown list.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Select <strong>Trend tooltip</strong> from the <strong>Page</strong> dropdown list.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">At this stage, you can hover over a bar to see the custom tooltip from the <strong>Trend tooltip</strong> page. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig36">Figure 3-36</a> shows the custom tooltip when you hover over the bar of <em>Anthony Grosse</em>.</p>

<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-36</strong> Trend tooltip shown as report page tooltip.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Note that the tooltip shows the <strong>Trend tooltip</strong> page that is filtered to show data only for <em>Anthony Grosse</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">When creating a tooltip page, you don’t have to show the same values in the tooltip as you show in the main visual—the tooltip can contain any arbitrary information. You can also use any page size for the tooltip page, and you can have more than one visual on it, too. Text may become harder to read when in a tooltip, so be conscious about user experience when creating tooltips.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec19"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_149"></span>Edit and configure interactions between visuals</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the defining features of Power BI is the interaction of visuals with each other. For example, you can select an item in a bar chart, and it will cross-highlight a column chart. This behavior is illustrated in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig37">Figure 3-37</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig37">

<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-37</strong> Cross-highlighting in action.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig37">Figure 3-37</a>, we selected a bar that displays <em>Profit</em> for <em>Tailspin Toys</em>. The other bars in this graph then became dimmed, and portions of columns in the other visual became highlighted. These highlighted portions represent Quantity values in each Color that relate to <em>Tailspin Toys</em>. This behavior is called <em>cross-highlighting</em>: selecting a data point in a visual will highlight portions of other visuals.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_150"></span>To change this behavior, you can select the bar chart, after which the <strong>Format</strong> ribbon becomes visible. Select <strong>Format</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit interactions</strong>. If you have more charts on the page, you’ll see new buttons appear in the top-right corner of other charts:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Filter</strong> Only shows values that relate to the selected data point</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Highlight</strong> Highlights portions of visuals that relate to the selected data point</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>None</strong> Ignores any selections</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You can see the interaction buttons and the effect of each interaction option in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig38">Figure 3-38</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig38">

<p class="indent">To hide the interaction buttons, select <strong>Format</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit interactions</strong> again.</p>
<p class="indent">Not every visual type has all three interaction options; some only have two, such as Filter and None. For example, it is not possible to highlight part of a slicer or a card. In these cases, the default behavior will be Filter instead of Highlight.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec20">Configure navigation for a report</h4>
<p class="noindent">Besides using the page bar for navigation in the report, you can configure page or bookmark navigators, which work similarly to buttons or slicers. To add a page or button navigator to the canvas, select <strong>Insert</strong> &gt; <strong>Buttons</strong> &gt; <strong>Navigator</strong> &gt; <strong>Page navigator</strong> or <strong>Bookmark navigator</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">If we used the same bookmarks as earlier in this section, our bookmark navigator would look like <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig39">Figure 3-39</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig39">

</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_151"></span>The page or bookmark navigator will update as you add pages or bookmarks, respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, you can configure some visualization items, such as buttons, to link to specific pages or bookmarks by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">Select an existing visualization item or insert a new one from the <strong>Insert</strong> ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">With the item selected, in the <strong>Format</strong> pane set the <strong>Action</strong> toggle to <strong>On</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p class="num">Select the desired page or bookmark from the <strong>Destination</strong> or <strong>Bookmark</strong> list, respectively.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">At this stage, if you hold the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key on your keyboard and select the visualization item, you will be taken to the page or bookmark you linked the item to.

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec21">Apply sorting</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a visual, Power BI will try to sort the data in the most appropriate way. For example, column charts are usually sorted in descending order of values. You can apply different sorting according to your business requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">To change sorting of a visual, hover over it, select <strong>More options</strong> &gt; <strong>Sort by</strong>, and select the field you want to sort by. To sort in descending or ascending order, hover over the visual and select <strong>More options</strong> &gt; <strong>Sort descending</strong> or <strong>Sort ascending</strong>, respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">The Table visual supports sorting by multiple columns at the same time. In the Wide World Importers example, you can sort a table by two columns in the following way:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">Create a table with the following fields:</p>
<ol class="alphaupper">
<li><p class="alpha"><strong>Year</strong> from the <strong>Date</strong> table (set summarization to <strong>Don’t summarize</strong>)</p></li>
<li><p class="alpha"><strong>Employee</strong> from the <strong>Employee</strong> table</p></li>
<li><p class="alpha"><strong>	Profit</strong> from the <strong>Sale</strong> table (set summarization to <strong>Sum</strong>)</p></li></ol></li>
<li><p class="num">In the visual, select the header of the <strong>Year</strong> column. Ensure that the arrow in the header points up for ascending order. If it points down, select the header again.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Press and hold the <strong>Shift</strong> key.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Select the header of the <strong>Profit</strong> column. Ensure that the arrow in the header points down for descending order. If it points up, select the header again.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The result should look like <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig40">Figure 3-40</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig40">

<p class="note-para">As discussed in Skill 2.1: Design a data model, you can also apply different sorting to columns in the data model—this feature is called Sort by column. When you use a sorted column on an axis in a visual, Power BI will usually sort the visual by this column instead of sorting by values.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec22">Configure sync slicers</h4>
<p class="noindent">Report-level filters, which we reviewed earlier in this chapter, can be useful when a filter is applicable to every page, whereas page-level filters are appropriate for page-specific filters. Sometimes there are filters that apply to more than one page, but not to all pages. Although the Filters pane does not offer a way to synchronize filters between only some pages, you can sync slicers between pages to address this scenario.</p>
<p class="indent">When you sync slicers, selections on one page are reflected on another page or pages. One way to synchronize slicers between pages is by copying a slicer on a different page as follows:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">Select a slicer and press <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>C</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Go to a different report page and press <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>V</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">When prompted as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig41">Figure 3-41</a>, select <strong>Sync</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig41">
<img src="graphics/03fig41.jpg" alt="The prompt asks: “One or more of the copies visuals can stay in sync with the visual it was copied from. Do you want to keep them in sync?”" width="450" height="213"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-41</strong> Sync visuals.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_153"></span>Alternatively, you can select <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Sync slicers</strong> and the slicer you want to sync, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig42">Figure 3-42</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig42">
<img src="graphics/03fig42.jpg" alt="The figure shows the Sync slicers pane." width="450" height="495"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-42</strong> Sync slicers pane.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If you don’t have this slicer on other pages, you can select <strong>Add and sync with all pages</strong> or you can select specific pages to add the slicer to. Selecting a check box under the Sync column adds the slicer; selecting a check box under the Visible column also makes it visible.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title"><span class="gray"><em>Note</em></span> Hidden Slicers</p>
<p class="note-para">If you add a slicer without making it visible, it will be hidden, and it will still affect the visuals on the page. Visual visibility is configured in the Selection pane, reviewed in the next section.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Typically, you sync slicers that use the same columns. It’s also possible to sync slicers that are based on different columns by using sync groups. For this, in <strong>Advanced options</strong> of <strong>Sync slicers</strong>, you need to enter the same group name for each slicer, and they’ll sync even if they’re based on different columns, like Invoice Date and Delivery Date.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, you can select <strong>Sync field changes to other slicers</strong> if you want slicers to be updated in case you change a column in one of them. For example, if you have a slicer on Color, and later you swap the field for Month, then synced slicers will all be updated to have Month as a column. Similarly, selecting <strong>Sync field changes to other slicers</strong> will update a slicer in case you apply a visual-level filter to one of the synced slicers.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec23"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154"></span>Group and layer visuals by using the Selection pane</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Selection pane allows you to control the visibility of visuals. To open the pane, select <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Selection</strong>. In the pane, you’ll see a list of visuals on the current page, which will all be visible by default.</p>
<p class="indent">The default names of the visuals correspond to their titles, and if a visual has no title, the visual will have the same name as the chart type. You will also see all visuals that have been hidden in the same pane. As a result, you may see multiple visuals with the same name. In this case, you can give your visuals meaningful names by adding appropriate titles.</p>
<p class="indent">To rename a visual in the Selection pane, double-click the visual in the Selection pane and enter a new name. Note that if your visual has a visible title, the title will be updated after you rename the visual in the Selection pane.</p>
<p class="indent">The Selection pane allows you to hide visuals by selecting <strong>Hide this visual</strong> (the eye icon) next to a visual. Note that hiding a visual does not remove it from the page; instead, the visual becomes invisible, but it is still part of the page. One of the implications of this is that hidden slicers can still filter other visuals. However, hidden visuals aren’t evaluated, which results in improved performance. You can see the <strong>Layer order</strong> section of the <strong>Selection</strong> pane with one visual hidden in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig43">Figure 3-43</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig43">
<img src="graphics/03fig43.jpg" alt="The figure shows the Layer order where we can see three visuals, one of which is hidden." width="250" height="374"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-43</strong> Selection pane.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">In the Selection pane, you can show or hide all visuals at once by selecting <strong>Show</strong> or <strong>Hide</strong>, respectively. You can change the layer order of visuals, also known as z-index or z-order, by selecting a visual and then the up or down arrows at the top of the pane. The layer order of a visual determines which visual gets selected when you click in an area where two visuals overlap.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155"></span>You can also group, ungroup, and merge groups within the Selection pane. Grouping visuals is useful for some scenarios, such as hiding visuals for bookmarks, moving around the report, or copying a number of visuals to other pages. Merging allows you to merge several groups into a single group without creating nested groups. To group visuals, you need to perform the following actions:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">Select several visuals by holding the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Right-click one of the selected visuals.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Select <strong>Group</strong> &gt; <strong>Group</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Ungrouping and merging are performed in a similar way. You can also rename groups in the same way as you rename a visual.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec24">Drill down into data using interactive visuals</h4>
<p class="noindent">Many visuals allow you to explore data interactively when you use several levels of fields—for example, Year, Quarter, and Month columns on the x-axis in a line chart. Whether you use a hierarchy defined in the data model or several individual columns together has no difference. When you right-click a data point in a visual that uses a hierarchy, depending on the current hierarchy level, you may see the following extra options:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Drill down</strong> Goes to the next level of the hierarchy within the selected point. For example, drilling down to Quarter from Year 2020 will show quarters for the year 2020 only.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Show next level</strong> Goes to the next level with no filter on the previous level. For example, selecting this option to go from Year to Quarter will show all quarters for all years without showing years.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Expand to next level</strong> This option combines the current and next levels. For example, when you select this option to go from Year to Quarter, you’ll see quarters for each year separately.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Drill up</strong> Goes back up one level.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">When a visual uses a hierarchy, the visual header will have extra buttons that correspond to these options. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig44">Figure 3-44</a> shows the buttons and the effect of each drill-down option.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig44">

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec27">Use the Analyze feature in Power BI</h4>
<p class="noindent">When looking at your data, you may want to analyze the trends and find patterns in your data. For example, you may want to know what caused a year-on-year increase in profit, for which you can use the Analyze feature in Power BI.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, if you have a line chart that shows profit by year, you can right-click a data point and select <strong>Analyze</strong> &gt; <strong>Explain the increase</strong> or <strong>Explain the decrease</strong>, depending on the direction of the change. Power BI will then prepare several charts and some commentary that may help you explain the difference, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig46">Figure 3-46</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig46">

</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_159"></span>When viewing the selection of the charts prepared by the Analyze feature, you can change the types of charts shown by selecting a corresponding icon below a chart. If you decide that a particular graph is useful, you can add it to your report page by selecting <strong>Add to page</strong> (the plus button) in the upper-right corner.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec28">Identify outliers</h4>
<p class="noindent">When a data point is not in the expected range, it’s called an <em>outlier</em>. Identifying outliers can be useful because they may happen for a variety of reasons, which you may often want to investigate. For example, a negative product unit price may mean a product return, or it may mean there’s a bug in the transactional database, which must be reported and corrected as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">When detecting outliers, you need to decide on the business logic behind the outlier—that is, what an outlier would constitute in your case. The logic will allow you to divide all data points into two groups—outliers and data points in the expected range.</p>
<p class="indent">You can detect outliers in a variety of ways. Besides data profiling and Quick Insights, which we reviewed earlier in the book, one of the most useful charts for detecting data anomalies is the scatter chart.</p>
<p class="indent">One way to use the scatter chart to identify outliers is to use the Details, X Axis, and Y Axis field wells. For example, the scatter chart in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig47">Figure 3-47</a> uses the Wide World Importers data and has <em>Stock Item</em> on Details, <em>Quantity</em> on X Axis, and <em>Profit</em> on Y Axis.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig47">
<img src="graphics/03fig47.jpg" alt="The figure shows a scatter plot that has a shape for each stock item. Quantity is on the x-axis and Profit is on the y-axis." width="733" height="413"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-47</strong> Quantity and Profit by Stock Item.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_160"></span>You can immediately see some points standing out. You can hover over the points you’re interested in to get more details and investigate further by cross-filtering other visuals or performing drill-down.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec29">Choose between continuous and categorical axes</h4>
<p class="noindent">When using numeric or date/time columns on an axis, you may be able to set the type to Continuous or Categorical in the axis format options of a visual. Text and logical columns can only be categorical.</p>
<p class="indent">The Continuous axis type is useful when there are many values in a column and showing them all at once would make the visual too crowded. In this case, you can use a continuous axis, which will show fewer axis labels. In <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig48">Figure 3-48</a>, you can see Profit by Unit Price with the continuous and categorical axes juxtaposed.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig48">
<img src="graphics/03fig48.jpg" alt="The figure shows two column charts, both showing Profit by Unit Price. The top chart has a continuous axis, while the bottom chart has a categorical axis." width="732" height="450"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-48</strong> Profit by Unit Price as column chart with a continuous and a categorical axis.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Note the following:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">The continuous axis shows axis labels spaced evenly, even if some axis values don’t exist. If there are no values for some axis values, there are going to be gaps. You can select a linear or logarithmic scale type. You cannot sort the axis by data values, and the frequency of axis labels is automatic.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">The categorical axis only shows the existing axis values. You can sort the axis by the axis values or data values.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">When you use more than one hierarchy level on an axis, depending on the visual, in most cases you can only use a categorical axis, with axis labels concatenated by default. If you sort the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_161"></span>axis by the axis values, then you also have an option to not concatenate the labels. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig49">Figure 3-49</a> shows a categorical axis with labels concatenated and displayed in a hierarchical manner.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig49">

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec30">Use groupings, binnings, and clustering</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to data clustering, you can perform grouping and binning of columns in Power BI to bring together data with business logic and higher-level data analysis.</p>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec68">Grouping</h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Grouping</em> allows you to manually group values in a column by leveraging a user interface instead of having to write DAX. For instance, you can group Sales Territory values into regions by following these steps:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">In the <strong>Fields</strong> pane, right-click the <strong>Sales Territory</strong> column in the <strong>City</strong> table and select <strong>New group</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">In the <strong>Name</strong> text box, enter <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Region</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Holding the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key, select <strong>Southeast</strong> and <strong>Southwest</strong>, and select <strong>Group</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Enter <strong>South</strong> as the new group name.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the following two groups:</p>
<ul class="sq1">
<li><p class="num"><strong>West</strong>—Far West, Plains, and Rocky Mountain</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>East</strong>—Great Lakes, Mideast, and New England</p></li></ul></li>
<li><p class="num">Select the <strong>Include Other group</strong> option. At this stage, the configuration should look like <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig50">Figure 3-50</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig50">
<img src="graphics/03fig50.jpg" alt="The figure shows how the Sales Region group is configured." width="733" height="532"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-50</strong> Sales Region group.</p></figure>
</li>
<li><p class="num"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_162"></span>Select <strong>OK</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">After you finish, Power BI creates a new column in the City table that you can use in visualizations and calculations, if needed. For example, you can use the new Sales Region column as the legend in a Filled map, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig51">Figure 3-51</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig51">
<img src="graphics/03fig51.jpg" alt="The figure shows a filled map with Sales Region as the legend. Three sales regions are shown." width="733" height="437"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-51</strong> Sales Region on a map.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163"></span>You can also create groups by selecting data points in a visual. For example, let’s say you have a scatter chart like the one shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig47">Figure 3-47</a>. You can group values as follows:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">Holding the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key, select a few data points on the scatter chart.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Right-click one of the selected data points.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Select <strong>Group data</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">This will create a column with two data groups that you can use as the chart legend.</p>
<p class="indent">The default group names are often not very user-friendly; to edit a group, right-click the column in the <strong>Fields</strong> pane and select <strong>Edit groups</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec69">Binning</h5>
<p class="noindent">When you work with categorical values, you can only create groups of type List. When you work with numeric or date/time columns, you can also create <em>bins</em>, which may be more appropriate when there are too many values to group manually.</p>
<p class="indent">Binning splits numeric and date/time data into groups of equal size. You can specify the number or size of bins. The default size or count is calculated automatically.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Wide World Importers example, you can bin the Profit column in the following way:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">Right-click the <strong>Profit</strong> column in the <strong>Fields</strong> pane and select <strong>New group</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Ensure <strong>Bin</strong> is selected in the <strong>Group type</strong> list.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Select <strong>Number of bins</strong> from the <strong>Bin type</strong> list.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Enter <strong>10</strong> as <strong>Bin count</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Select <strong>OK</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">This creates the Profit (bins) column, which you can use in a column chart to create a histogram, as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig52">Figure 3-52</a>. The histogram uses the count of Sale rows as values.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig52">
<img src="graphics/03fig52.jpg" alt="The figure shows a column chart with Profit (bins) on the x-axis and Sale Rows on values." width="650" height="343"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-52</strong> Profit histogram.</p>
</figure>
<pre><span class="bg">Sale Rows = COUNTROWS(Sale)</span></pre>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_164"></span>You can edit bins by right-clicking the corresponding column in the <strong>Fields</strong> pane and selecting <strong>Edit groups</strong>. If you want to change the group type from Bin to List, you’ll need to re-create the group.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec70">Clustering</h5>
<p class="noindent">The scatter chart can also be used to cluster data points, which can often group some outliers together. You can perform clustering in a scatter chart as follows:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">Hover over a scatter chart and select <strong>More options</strong> &gt; <strong>Automatically find clusters</strong>. Note that this option will be disabled if you use a field in the Legend field well.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">If desired, change the name, description, and number of clusters.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Select <strong>OK</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Once finished, you’ll see a new field in your model and the Legend field well. In the Wide World Importers example, if you wanted to see five clusters, you’d see the Stock Item (clusters) shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig53">Figure 3-53</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig53">
<img src="graphics/03fig53.jpg" alt="The figure shows a scatter chart that has five clusters of stock items." width="650" height="372"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-53</strong> Stock Item clusters.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">You can now see two clusters of outliers: Cluster2 has outliers in terms of Quantity, whereas Cluster5 has outliers in terms of Profit. Note that you can use the new Stock Item (clusters) field in other visuals and filters.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to edit the clusters, right-click the clusters field in the <strong>Fields</strong> pane and select <strong>Edit clusters</strong>. A quick way to change a cluster name is by double-clicking it to highlight it and typing the new name.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec31">Use AI visuals</h4>
<p class="noindent">Some visuals in Power BI can leverage AI, allowing you to apply advanced analysis to your data. We’ve already covered the Q&amp;A visual in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, “Model the data.” In this section, we cover the Key influencers and Decomposition tree visuals.</p>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec71"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_165"></span>Key influencers</h5>
<p class="noindent">The Key influencers visual helps you understand the variables that drive a metric. For example, you may want to understand what influences profit to increase, and you may be looking at factors such as location, buying package, and time of the year. The Key influencers visual will analyze the data you provide and rank each factor in terms of importance.</p>
<p class="indent">The Key influencers visual has the following field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Analyze</strong> The metric you want to analyze. It can be continuous or categorical.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Explain by</strong> The factors you want to check in terms of influence.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Expand by</strong> When analyzing a measure or a summarized field, you can increase the detail level without considering these factors as influencers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In the Wide World Importers example, you can build a Key influencers visual as follows:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">Select the Key influencers visual from the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Add <strong>Profit</strong> from the <strong>Sale</strong> table to the <strong>Analyze</strong> field well and ensure that summarization is set to <strong>Sum</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Add the following fields to the <strong>Explain by</strong> field well:</p>
<ul class="sq1">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>State Province</strong> from the <strong>City</strong> table</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Buying Group</strong> from the <strong>Customer</strong> table</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Buying Package</strong> from the <strong>Stock Item</strong> table</p></li></ul></li>
<li><p class="num">Add <strong>Year</strong> and <strong>Month</strong> from the <strong>Date</strong> table to the <strong>Expand by</strong> field well.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The result is shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig54">Figure 3-54</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig54">
<img src="graphics/03fig54.jpg" alt="The figure shows the Key influencers visual that displays the top factors that influence Profit to increase." width="732" height="403"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-54</strong> Key influencers.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">You can select each bubble to see how it influences Profit. For instance, the right half of <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig54">Figure 3-54</a> shows that when Buying Package is Each, Profit is more likely to increase. Also note that Buying Group is not a major influence on Profit, since it’s not shown in the visual.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_166"></span>Whereas the Key influencers tab in the Key influencers visual shows how each factor individually affects a metric, the <strong>Top segments</strong> tab shows how a combination of factors influences a measure. The Top segments tab is shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig55">Figure 3-55</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig55">
<img src="graphics/03fig55.jpg" alt="The figure shows the top segments that affect a metric." width="732" height="402"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-55</strong> Top segments.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">Below each segment, you can see the average profit in the segment and the population count, or the number of records you have for the segment. Note that in this case average does not mean the average of the Profit column but instead the average of the aggregated Profit value, which in this case is sum.</p>
<p class="indent">You can select a segment to see what it consists of and how it compares to the overall population. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig56">Figure 3-56</a> shows an example of a segment.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig56">
<img src="graphics/03fig56.jpg" alt="The figure shows the components of a segment, and how it compares to the overall population in terms of the metric analyzed and record count." width="732" height="403"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-56</strong> Top segment example.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167"></span>The Key influencers visual is appropriate to use when you want to find out the most important factors that affect a metric you select. You can also compare the relative significance of each factor.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec72">Decomposition tree</h5>
<p class="noindent">The Decomposition tree allows you to perform exploratory analysis by successively breaking down a measure by multiple dimensions. In the process, you can select a dimension you want to slice by, or you can make the visual find the split that will provide the highest or lowest value among all selected dimensions.</p>
<p class="indent">The visual has the following field wells:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Analyze</strong> The measure or aggregated field you want to analyze</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Explain by</strong> The dimensions you want to analyze by</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Tooltips</strong> The measures or aggregated fields you want to show when hovering over a bar</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Let’s say Wide World Importers is interested in understanding what makes up the total Profit figure in terms of Sales Territory, Customer, Stock Item, and Selling Package. You can see the Decomposition tree visual that can be used for these purposes in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig57">Figure 3-57</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig57">
<img src="graphics/03fig57.jpg" alt="The figure shows the Decomposition tree visual with total Profit bar on the left, followed by a breakdown by Sales Territory, Selling Package, Color, and Customer." width="733" height="383"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-57</strong> Decomposition tree.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">When you select the <strong>+</strong> sign next to a bar, you can select one of the fields from the <strong>Explain by</strong> field well, or you can find the highest or lowest value among the remaining dimensions. The visual can be compared to a bar chart that offers a user-friendlier way to drill down, and it uses AI to find high and low values in data.</p>
<p class="indent">The Decomposition tree is a great choice when you want to perform root cause analysis or ad hoc exploration.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec32">Use the Forecast feature</h4>
<p class="noindent">For time-series data, you can use the Forecast feature to estimate future values. The Forecast feature is available only for line charts. To add a forecast line, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">Select your line chart.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Open the <strong>Analytics</strong> pane in the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Switch the <strong>Forecast</strong> toggle to <strong>On</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Expand the <strong>Forecast</strong> section and configure and format as needed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">For example, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig58">Figure 3-58</a> shows a line chart with a forecast line for the next year with monthly seasonality and 75 percent confidence interval, ignoring the last month. When you hover over a forecast line, you’ll see the confidence interval upper and lower bound values in addition to the forecast value.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig58">
<img src="graphics/03fig58.jpg" alt="The figure shows a line chart with a forecast line. A tooltip shows the forecast value and the upper and lower bounds of the forecast estimate." width="666" height="276"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-58</strong> Forecast line.</p>
</figure>
<p class="indent">To remove the forecast from your line chart, switch its toggle in the <strong>Analytics</strong> pane to <strong>Off</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec33">Create reference lines by using the Analytics pane</h4>
<p class="noindent">Reference lines can be a useful addition to charts to make it easier for users to draw insights. In Power BI, you can add one or more reference lines to a visual from the <strong>Analytics</strong> pane inside the <strong>Visualizations</strong> pane. The Analytics pane shows the number of reference lines of each type that were added to a visual.</p>
<p class="indent">Depending on the visual and data types used in the visual, you may be able to add some of the following reference lines:</p>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Trend line</strong> Fitted straight trend line</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_169"></span><strong>X-axis constant line</strong> Static vertical line</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Y-axis constant line</strong> Static horizontal line</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Min line</strong> Dynamic minimum line</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Max line</strong> Dynamic maximum line</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Average line</strong> Dynamic average (mean) line</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Median line</strong> Dynamic median line</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Percentile line</strong> Dynamic line for which you need to enter the percentile value</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Symmetry shading</strong> Shades the regions across the symmetry line</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><strong>Ratio line</strong> Ratio of total for all points of Y values over X values</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You can add a new reference line to a visual in the following way:</p>
<ol class="num">
<li><p class="num">Select a visual.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Select the <strong>Analytics</strong> pane.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Expand the relevant section of the <strong>Analytics</strong> pane.</p></li>
<li><p class="num">Select <strong>Add</strong> or switch the toggle to <strong>On</strong> as needed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Depending on the reference line type, you may want to configure it further. You can rename a reference line by double-clicking its name, which can be useful in case you want to display its name as a data label.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig59">Figure 3-59</a> shows a line chart with a trend and max lines.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03fig59">
<img src="graphics/03fig59.jpg" alt="The figure shows a line chart with a trend line and a maximum line, labelled Record Profit." width="575" height="311"/>
<p class="figcaption"><strong>FIGURE 3-59</strong> Profit trend and max lines.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_170"></span>Chapter summary</h3>
<ul class="sq-s">
<li><p class="bull">There are multiple ways to add a visual to a report page, one of which is to select a visual icon from the Visualizations pane. Besides visuals, you can add other elements from the Insert ribbon: Text box, Buttons, Shapes, and Image. You can set various actions for these elements such as bookmarks, page navigation, or hyperlinks.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">There are a number of built-in standard visuals that you can choose to best represent data:</p>
<ul class="sq1">
<li><p class="bull">To compare values across categories, use a bar or column chart.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">To compare values across time, use a line or area chart.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">When plotting values of different scales, such as units and percentages, use a combo chart or a line chart with dual y-axes.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">If you want to show changes in ranking across time, the ribbon chart is appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">The waterfall chart can be suitable to show the changes in categories between time periods.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">The scatter plot can show the relationship between two variables, and it can show dynamics across time.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">The pie, donut, and treemap charts show the relationships of parts to the whole.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">The gauge, card, multirow card, and KPI visuals can be used to show key metrics by themselves or compared to targets.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Map visuals can be used to show spatial data.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><p class="bull">In addition to built-in visuals, Power BI supports visuals built by using Power BI SDK, also known as custom visuals. They can be imported from files or AppSource.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Power BI visuals can be formatted in different ways in the Format pane. Some formatting options can be tied to measures—this is known as expression-based or conditional formatting.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">You can save time and apply consistent formatting across your report by using a report theme.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">To apply filters to visuals, you can use slicers, the Filters pane, or both. Slicers can be used to filter by a single column, or you can build hierarchical slicers. Filters in the Filters pane can be applied to a visual, a page, or the whole report.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">For each page, you can configure its size, background, alignment, and wallpaper, as well as format the Filters pane. You can also set a page to be a tooltip page or a Q&amp;A result.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">By using Analyze in Excel, you can visualize your data in Microsoft Excel charts, as well as built PivotTables based on data from your Power BI datasets.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Paginated reports in Power BI are a great fit for reports meant to be printed and shared offline.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_171"></span>A dashboard can have pinned visuals from a variety of sources, including Power BI reports. Additionally, you can add tiles that aren’t backed by datasets—for example, videos and web content.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Pinned visuals become dashboard tiles that aren’t fully interactive. To have visuals interact with each other, you can pin a live report page to a dashboard.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Dashboards support the Q&amp;A feature that is also available in reports. Q&amp;A results can be pinned to dashboards.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">You can add a theme to a dashboard by selecting one of the preset themes or defining your own. Alternatively, you can upload a JSON theme, which uses the same format as report themes.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Dashboards can have mobile views to optimize the viewing experience for different screen sizes. You can reorder, resize, and hide tiles when creating a mobile view, and the web view remains intact.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Bookmarks can help create data stories or highlight specific insights in the report. A bookmark can be configured to save the state of a page, including filters and the visibility of visuals.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">You can override the standard tooltips by configuring a page tooltip for a visual.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Selecting a data point on a visual can cross-highlight, cross-filter, or have no effect on other visuals on the same page, depending on how you configure visual interactions.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">In addition to using the page navigation bar, you can employ page and bookmark navigators, as well as buttons to configure navigation for a report by using the Page navigation or Bookmark actions.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Most visuals can be sorted by the fields they use in ascending or descending order. The Table visual supports sorting by multiple fields simultaneously by holding the Shift key.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Sync slicers is useful when you want to synchronize filters between several but not all pages of a report. You can also sync filters between different fields by using the advanced options of Sync slicers.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">In the Selection pane, you can hide, rename, and group visuals together. You can also change the layer and tab order of visuals or grouped visuals.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">When a visual uses a hierarchy, you can drill down to explore the data points of the visual in more detail.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Power BI reports can be optimized for smaller screens by configuring mobile layouts.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">The Analyze feature can explain the differences between values from a chart.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">You can identify outliers—unexpected data points—by using data profiling, Quick Insights, and visuals such as scatter charts, which also allow you to cluster values and group outliers together.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">A continuous axis shows axis labels evenly even if there’s no data, whereas a categorical axis only shows axis labels that exist in your data.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_172"></span>To enhance your data model, you can group and bin your data by leveraging the Data groups feature in the Power BI Desktop user interface. You can create a group of type List by visually selecting a few data points, or you can create a new data group by manually selecting members for each new group from a list of values. For numerical and date/time columns, you can create bins, which evenly divide values into groups based on ranges. The ranges can be determined by the size of each group or by the number of groups.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">The Key influencers visual can help you understand what makes a certain metric go up or down or belong to a certain category. The Decomposition tree allows you to perform root cause analysis or drill down interactively when analyzing a measure.</p></li>
<li><p class="bull">Reference lines can enhance your charts to make data easier to understand and insights stand out. You can also perform time-series forecasting by using the Analytics pane in Power BI.</p></li>

<p class="answer"><span class="gray"><strong><a id="ch03que1a" href="ch03.xhtml#ch03que1">1</a>.</strong></span> The answer is <strong>C</strong>. The Key influencers visual shows the most important factors based on the fields you provide. Though it may be possible to get some insight into success factors by using a decomposition tree—option A—doing so would involve significant time and effort. Neither the funnel nor the stacked column chart from options B and D, respectively, will highlight the most important factors out of many.</p>
<p class="answer"><span class="gray"><strong><a id="ch03que2a" href="ch03.xhtml#ch03que2">2</a>.</strong></span> The answer is <strong>B</strong>. Using the Page navigation action allows you to select the pages you want to navigate to without creating bookmarks, as in option A. Though it’s possible to use a table to drill through to a specific page—option C—doing so would involve considerably more effort than buttons. Option D, text boxes with hyperlinks, would require you to know the URL of each page, and it wouldn’t work in Power BI Desktop.</p>
<p class="answer"><span class="gray"><strong><a id="ch03que3a" href="ch03.xhtml#ch03que3">3</a>.</strong></span> The answer is <strong>D</strong>. Tab order determines the order in which users switch between visuals when using the keyboard. Bookmarks—option A—aren’t helpful for navigating within each page. Layer order—option B—determines the order in which visuals are layered and may be different from Tab order. Mobile layout—option C—is used to create mobile reports.</p>
<p class="answer"><span class="gray"><strong><a id="ch03que4a" href="ch03.xhtml#ch03que4">4</a>.</strong></span> The answer is <strong>A</strong>. The Filter interaction filters a chart, and it’s not showing the overall values as Highlight from option B does. If you select None—option C —there will be no interaction between charts.</p>
<p class="answer"><span class="gray"><strong><a id="ch03que5a" href="ch03.xhtml#ch03que5">5</a>.</strong></span> The answer is <strong>C</strong> or <strong>D</strong>. If you add Profit to tooltips, you’ll see the corresponding value when hovering over a bar. Similarly, a report page that shows Profit and that’s configured to be the tooltip page will also show a client’s Profit when you hover over a bar. Adding Profit to visual-level filters, as in option A, won’t show Profit anywhere. Similarly, adding Profit to drill-through fields won’t show Profit when hovering over bars in the visual.</p>
<p class="answer"><span class="gray"><strong><a id="ch03que6a" href="ch03.xhtml#ch03que6">6</a>.</strong></span> The answer is <strong>C</strong>. Using the Video type of Tile allows you to embed a video that can be played without leaving the page, and you only need a video URL. Custom streaming data—option A—is meant for data, not videos. Though you can put a video URL in a text box as option B suggests, a user will have to leave the page to view the video. Although you can use the Web content tile to embed a video by using embed code, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_175"></span>doing so requires pasting several lines of code, and the video may have scroll bars in case its aspect ratio is different from that of a tile.</p>
<p class="answer"><span class="gray"><strong><a id="ch03que7a" href="ch03.xhtml#ch03que7">7</a>.</strong></span> The answer is <strong>A</strong>. The data groups functionality provides a user interface that allows you to maintain groups with the least effort. Option B is wrong because the Bin type does not apply to categorical values. Options C and D are both wrong because they require writing formulas, which involves more effort than data groups.</p>
<p class="answer"><span class="gray"><strong><a id="ch03que8a" href="ch03.xhtml#ch03que8">8</a>.</strong></span> The answer is <strong>B</strong>. An Average line will show the mean revenue in the visual, and it will automatically respect all filters. Option A is wrong because it requires writing nontrivial code to mimic the behavior of an Average line from the Analytics pane. Option C is wrong because median is not the same as mean or average. Option D is wrong because the calculated column won’t consider any filters that users may apply.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_176"></span></p>
