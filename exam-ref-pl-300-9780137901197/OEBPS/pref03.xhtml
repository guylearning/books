<p class="noindent">I would like to thank Loretta Yates for trusting me to write the official Power BI exam reference book, Charvi Arora for handling the project, the editing team for making this book a better read, and everyone else at Pearson who worked on this book to make it happen.</p>
<p class="indent">A few people have contributed to my becoming a fan of Power BI. Gabriel Polo Reyes was instrumental in my introduction to the world of Microsoft BI. Thomas van Vliet, my first client, hired me despite my having no prior commercial experience with Power BI and fed me many problems that led to my mastering Power BI.</p>
