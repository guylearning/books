<p class="ct">Window Dressing on Steroids—Lehman Brothers Repo 105</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to its bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers undertook an accounting scheme dubbed Repo 105 whose sole purpose was to understate the firm’s true debt levels. Fraud is a deliberate misrepresentation for personal gain. As such, Lehman’s Repo 105 scheme is a clear case of fraud. It is remarkable that no one from Lehman was ever charged with fraud.</p>
<p class="indent">A traditional repurchase agreement (repo) is basically a short-term loan (from overnight to a few weeks) between banks. It is usually done with the borrower providing highly liquid assets, normally U.S. treasury bills, for the loan. The difference between a loan secured to the asset and a repo is that under a repo, the lender technically has legal title of the asset.</p>
<p class="indent">The accounting treatment for this type of transaction is normally that of a loan secured to the asset. However, U.S. GAAP Statement of Accounting Standards 140 (SFAS 140), <i>Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities</i>, allows the repo to be treated as a sale and a forward purchase commitment under specific conditions. First, the borrowing firm cannot have physical custody of the assets. Second, the lender who receives the assets must have the right to pledge or sell the assets (and the borrower loses that right). Third, the borrower cannot have control over the assets through any agreements. In addition, practice dictates the assets must be worth more than 102 percent of the cash received. Hence, doing the deal at 105 percent (Repo 105<a href="#c6an38" id="ic6an38"><sup>38</sup></a>) could give technical cover to treat the deal as a sale instead of a loan.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_143"></a>Lehman Brothers reported a series of repurchase agreements, known as Repo 105s, as sales, without any disclosure of Lehman’s contractual obligation to repurchase the assets—a blatant form of window dressing not allowed under U.S. GAAP.<a href="#c6an39" id="ic6an39"><sup>39</sup></a> The asset would disappear from the Balance Sheet and be replaced by cash. Lehman then used the cash to pay down its debt, which lowered total assets and debt and improved many of the firm’s ratios—especially its leverage ratio. A few days after the end of each quarter, Lehman would borrow funds to repay the amount previously borrowed plus interest and would use those funds to repurchase the assets.</p>
<p class="indent">Lehman was unable to obtain a legal opinion from its U.S. law firms that this represented a bona fide sale. It therefore found a British law firm, Linklaters, who wrote an opinion that a repo could be booked as a sale, even if the repo included a repurchase agreement for <i>equivalent</i> assets (which could be the same bonds or securities), as long as the assets were not the actual securities sold. Because a British law firm gave the opinion to Lehman’s British subsidiary, the transaction could only be conducted by the British subsidiary. Lehman U.S. (LBSF) transferred the asset to Lehman Europe (LBIE) at 100 percent of its market value. Lehman Europe then transferred the asset at its market value, say $105 million, to the counterparty (another European or a Japanese bank) in exchange for cash of slightly less than market value, say $100 million. The difference in the market value of the security (e.g., the $105 million given by Lehman) and the amount of cash provided (e.g., the $100 million from the European or Japanese bank), was a margin of safety for the lender (e.g., the European or Japanese bank).</p>
<p class="indent">Selling an asset worth $105 million for only $100 million should have caused Lehman to book a loss of $5 million on the sale. Lehman overcame this obstacle by creating a new asset at the time of sale, a derivative with a mark-to-market value of $5 million, reflecting the fact that when Lehman repurchased the asset, it would receive an asset worth $105 million for $100 million cash (plus accrued interest) and eliminate the derivative asset from its books. Thus, for accounting purposes, Lehman effectively <a id="page_144"></a>recorded an increase of cash of $100 million, an increase in a derivative worth $5 million, and a reduction of assets worth $105 million—thereby avoiding any Income Statement impact. Seven to ten days later, after the end of the year or quarter, Lehman would repurchase the asset and unwind the entire transaction.</p>
<p class="indent">The amounts involved are staggering. Lehman engaged in Repo 105s in the amount of $38.6 billion at the end 2007, $49.1 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2008, and $50.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2008.<a href="#c6an40" id="ic6an40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">These deals allowed Lehman to remove debt from its Balance Sheet and present a leverage ratio that was 10–15 percent lower, making Lehman look much less risky than it really was. As noted by the bankruptcy examiner, “Repo 105 transactions were used as a shortcut for meeting quarter‐end Balance Sheet targets (i.e., avoiding breaches of Balance Sheet limits) and reaching the firm-wide net leverage ratio target.”</p>
<p class="indent">Ernst &amp; Young LLP<a href="#c6an41" id="ic6an41"><sup>41</sup></a> (E&amp;Y), Lehman’s auditors, earned $31 million in fees for their 2007 audit and gave Lehman a clean audit report. The senior partner on the audit, William Schlich, testified that E&amp;Y had been aware of Repo 105s for many years and had discussed their accounting treatment with Lehman many times over the years. However, Schlich claimed that E&amp;Y had no advisory role on them and had not “approved” their accounting treatment, but had accepted/concurred with their treatment for audit purposes.</p>
<p class="indent">E&amp;Y claimed they did not analyze whether the Repo 105s complied with U.S. GAAP (SFAS 140) but only reviewed Lehman’s interpretation “of the requirements of SFAS 140 in the abstract and as reflected in the accounting policy.”<a href="#c6an42" id="ic6an42"><sup>42</sup></a> This sounds eerily similar to the Tom Lehrer<a href="#c6an43" id="ic6an43"><sup>43</sup></a> line, “Once the rockets are up who cares where they come down. That’s not my <a id="page_145"></a>department, said Wernher von Braun.”<a href="#c6an44" id="ic6an44"><sup>44</sup></a> Auditors are supposed to carefully examine all major transactions close to year-end and question any that are reversed out shortly after year end. In his conclusion, Lehman’s bankruptcy examiner noted that “sufficient evidence exists to support colorable claims against Ernst &amp; Young LLP (“Ernst &amp; Young”) for professional malpractice arising from Ernst &amp; Young’s failure to follow professional standards of care with respect to communications with Lehman’s Audit Committee.”<a href="#c6an45" id="ic6an45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">During Lehman’s bankruptcy proceedings, government auditors claimed they had no knowledge of the repo deals. Likewise, credit rating agencies stated they had no knowledge that the repo deals were being presented as sales, that they would have wanted to know, and that the knowledge would have affected their credit rating.</p>
<p class="indent">The Repo 105 mechanism appears to have been designed and used solely to improve Lehman’s leverage ratios. The fact that there was no economic rationale for this type of transaction, combined with the fact that there was no disclosure of the transactions (meaning even a sophisticated user of financial information would not have known this was being done), leads to the conclusion that Lehman engaged in fraud. As Lehman’s bankruptcy examiner concluded, “There is sufficient evidence to support a determination by a trier of fact that Lehman’s failure to disclose that it relied upon Repo 105 transactions to temporarily reduce the firm’s net balance sheet and net leverage ratio was materially misleading. . . . Even if Lehman’s use of Repo 105 transactions technically complied with SFAS 140, financial statements may be materially misleading even when they do not violate GAAP.”<a href="#c6an46" id="ic6an46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In addition, as noted by the bankruptcy examiner, “SEC Rule 12b‐20 requires that all filings contain such additional information necessary to make the information contained in the filing not misleading. There is sufficient evidence to support a determination by the trier of fact that Lehman’s filings were deficient and misleading. In the wake of the Enron scandal, at the request of four major accounting firms, the SEC provided <a id="page_146"></a>additional guidance with respect to the duty to provide meaningful discussion of a company’s financial statements.”<a href="#c6an47" id="ic6an47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Despite the bankruptcy examiner’s conclusion that Fuld “knew or should have known” (page 998), to date, no one who worked at Lehman has been charged with fraud because the SEC has apparently decided there is not enough evidence. Richard Fuld, Lehman’s CEO, denied any knowledge of repos being treated as sales instead of loans. He denied seeing any reports outlining the use of Repo 105s or 108s. He also said that it would have “concerned him” had he known. Although there may be no written documentation of Fuld having been told and knowing about the Repo 105 transactions, the bankruptcy examiner did not find it credible that Fuld knew nothing. Bart McDade, who became Lehman’s President and COO on June 18, 2008, claimed Fuld did know (which, if true, makes Fuld’s positive public comments about Lehman during its final days fraudulent and Fuld liable to criminal prosecution).</p>
<p class="indent1">In your author’s opinion, individuals are responsible for their actions and should not be allowed to justify wrongful actions because attorneys, accountants, or corporate boards provide approval. Neither should individuals be “off the hook” simply because there is no clear written documentation they knew about something that it seems clear they should have known about. <i>So when does it become fraud?</i> Perhaps when it fits U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart’s famous quote concerning pornography: “I know it when I see it.”<a href="#c6an48" id="ic6an48"><sup>48</sup></a> On its face, this appears to be a case where the SEC should have let a jury decide.</p>
