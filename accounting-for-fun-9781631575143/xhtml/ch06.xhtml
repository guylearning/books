<p class="noindent">Our financial century began with the bursting of the dot-com bubble<a href="#c6n1" id="ic6n1"><sup>1</sup></a> after incredible hype and a belief that spectacular revenue growth would continue, with profits to follow at some point. After the dot-com bubble, the next seminal corporate event of the century was probably the collapse of Enron from number eight on the Fortune 500 list to bankruptcy and oblivion. Enron came to symbolize corporate greed and accounting chicanery. In the wake of Enron, the U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) law with a rarely seen overwhelming vote of 522 in favor, 3 opposed, and 9 not voting.<a href="#c6n2" id="ic6n2"><sup>2</sup></a> The new law was designed to enhance audit committees and financial disclosures, to provide for additional possible actions against managers who do not exercise proper internal control procedures, to increase government oversight of corporations, and to tighten auditor independence requirements. Arguably, SOX has not worked as planned in preventing frauds and corporate scandals (and it certainly did not prevent the great U.S. recession of 2008).<a href="#c6n3" id="ic6n3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent1">This chapter presents the tools and methods of financial statement analysis, which are meant to help outsiders understand the key economic <a id="page_98"></a>drivers of a firm, project future cash flows, and alert investors to potential problems or opportunities. After setting up how financial analysis should be done, the chapter will provide two opposite examples. The first is Enron, which illustrates how traditional financial analysis can reveal potential problems (the financial statements and ratios for Enron are provided in <a href="#c6e1" id="ic6e1">Exhibits 6.1</a>–<a href="#c6e5" id="ic6e5">6.5</a>). The second is HubSpot, a modern unicorn, that illustrates the limitations of traditional financial analysis to evaluate high-growth, early-stage firms and how additional information can help (the financial statements and ratios for HubSpot are provided in <a href="#c6e6" id="ic6e6">Exhibits 6.6</a>–6.9).<a href="#c6n4" id="ic6n4"><sup>4</sup></a> The chapter then presents an analysis of whether models using accounting data can successfully predict if a firm will be able to meet its future obligations as well as whether these models can be used to determine the quality of accounting earnings.</p>
<p class="h2">Are the Numbers Reasonable?</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Garbage In Garbage Out:</b> Financial analysis should start by reviewing the numbers in the financial statements to check whether they make sense. There are two key questions you should ask yourself when starting financial analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">First: <i>Is the absolute level of each number plausible?</i> For example, in the Oil Swindle of 1963, the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Company (Allied) claimed sales of $250 million, which represented 75 percent of total U.S. exports of cottonseed and soybean oil. Allied leased approximately 100 tanks to store the oil, with a total capacity of about 500 million pounds of vegetable oil, yet the firm claimed to have 1.8 billion pounds of oil in inventory. At the time, the United States exported about 1.2 billion pounds a year. Thus, Allied’s reported 1.8 billion pounds represented 1.5 times the total annual exports of the country. <i>Did it made sense for this one firm to have that quantity of inventory?</i> Definitely not. When Allied filed for bankruptcy on November 19, 1963, the firm had only about 100 million pounds of various substances in the tanks (mostly water and sludge, not oil). Allied’s $100 million <a id="page_99"></a>purported worth of vegetable oil turned out to be, in reality, a mere $6 million worth.<a href="#c6n5" id="ic6n5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent1">Second: <i>Does the growth in revenue seem reasonable (or plausible)?</i> For example, in the scandal that engulfed the insurance firm Equity Funding Corporation of America in 1973, revenues were growing at 67 percent a year for seven years.<a href="#c6n6" id="ic6n6"><sup>6</sup></a> Today this may seem like a firm doing extremely well. However, back in the late 1970s, this growth rate made Equity Funding one of the fastest-growing firms in America. <i>Was it possible?</i> Perhaps. <i>Was it likely, given that Equity Funding was an insurance firm, the insurance industry’s average growth rate at the time was 5 percent, and the next best growth rate of any firm in the industry was 12 percent?</i> It certainly seems questionable. <i>What allowed Equity Funding to report growth that was more than 5 times the number two player and 13 times the industry average?</i> Massive fraud (more than half the revenue did not exist). More recent examples of frauds where the numbers should have been questioned more rigorously include Bre-X and Sino-Forest.</p>
<p class="h2">Components of Financial Analysis</p>
<p class="noindent">Financial analysis (also called ratio analysis) is a diagnostic tool. It is a starting point in understanding a firm’s underlying economics and measuring its financial health and performance. Ratios by themselves have little or no meaning. There is no magic number above or below which a ratio has to be. Rather, ratios must be compared to something, such as what is expected, a trend over time, the ratios of other firms, and/or industry averages. Understanding why a firm’s ratios <a id="page_100"></a>differ from expectations helps analysts understand what is happening in a firm.</p>
<p class="indent1">There are four main categories of ratios: profitability, activity, leverage, and liquidity. Each of these will be discussed in turn below.</p>
<p class="h2">Profitability Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent1">Profitability ratios focus on a firm’s ability to generate profits at a given sales or investment level. Below are a few possible profitability ratios:</p>
<p class="ul">Gross profit margin = gross profit/sales</p>
<p class="ul">Operating profit margin = operating profit/sales</p>
<p class="ul">Net profit margin = net profit/sales</p>
<p class="ul">Return on assets = net income before financing costs/total assets</p>
<p class="ull">Return on equity = net income/owners’ equity</p>
<p class="indent">The first three, <b>profit margins</b>, essentially measure the profit on a dollar of sales revenue. They can be computed for various levels of profit (gross profit, operating profit, net profit, and so on). The numerator is the profit number. The denominator is the sales number.</p>
<p class="indent">The last two, <b>returns</b>, measure the profits given an amount invested. For example, imagine two firms, one having a net profit of $5 million and the other having a net profit of $40 million. <i>Which firm has done better?</i> Clearly, the second firm has earned more, but the profits do not tell the whole story. For example, if the first firm earned the $5 million with an investment of $25 million (a 20 percent return), whereas the second firm earned $40 million on an investment of $400 million (a 10 percent return), we might feel the first firm did better. In other words, there is more to determining a firm’s profitability than just looking at the total profit earned.</p>
<p class="indent1"><b>Return on assets (ROA)</b> is an evaluation of management’s use of the firm’s resources, their ability to generate profit given the total resources available. As such, it excludes any impact from how the resources were financed. This allows a comparison across firms and over time independent of any differences in how a firm is financed. The numerator is net profit <a id="page_101"></a>adjusted for the cost of financing net of any tax effects. The denominator is the total resources available.</p>
<p class="eq1">ROA = (net income + interest expense (1 − the tax rate))/total assets</p>
<p class="indent1">To explain a bit more about ROA: imagine you have two firms, both earning $100 million before finance charges and taxes. The first firm has financed the resources entirely with equity. The second firm has financed with both debt and equity, and has an annual interest charge of $20 million. Unadjusted, financing clearly has an impact on profitability. If the corporate tax rate is 30 percent, the first firm will have net profit of $70 million, whereas the second firm will have net profit of $56 million because of its annual interest charge. The cost of financing thus has an effect that should be excluded in an evaluation of asset.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-101.jpg" width="502" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">Considering profitability while explicitly excluding how the resources were financed requires adjusting for the cost of financing. However, simply adding back the interest expense (which would have Firm B showing an adjusted profit of $76 million) is incorrect because the interest charges are tax deductible. Essentially, the government shares the cost of financing by allowing the firm to reduce taxable income by the amount of interest expense. In the example above, the government picks up $6 million of the total cost of financing (which can be seen in the difference in the tax of the two firms, $30 million versus $24 million). The true cost of financing for Firm B is therefore $14 million, or interest minus tax savings (calculated as the $20 million in interest × [1 − the tax rate]). We can make the two firms’ profits directly comparable by adding back Firm B’s after-tax financing charge of $14 million.</p>
<p class="image1" id="page_102"><img src="../images/img-102.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1"><b>Return on equity (ROE)</b> measures the return to a specific investor group: the owners. No adjustment is made to the numerator because borrowing well (or poorly) is part of the net return to the owners.</p>
<p class="eq1">ROE = net income/owner’s equity</p>
<p class="h2">Be Sure to Understand What Numbers Are Used</p>
<p class="noindent">There are hundreds if not thousands of different ratios that can be used in financial analysis, making it critical to understand their exact definitions and to be consistent across time and firms. It is also important to ensure the calculations are being done correctly. For example, when computing the profit margins above, an Income Statement number is divided by an Income Statement number (e.g., net income/sales). As long as the same Income Statement is used, there should be no problem. However, for ROA and ROE, the Income Statement number is divided by a Balance Sheet number, which leads to the questions: <i>Which Balance Sheet should be used? The opening Balance Sheet (last year’s closing number), the closing Balance Sheet (this year’s close), or some average (simple average, monthly average, and so on)?</i> Surprisingly, most textbooks suggest using the simple average: (opening number + closing number)/2. However, unless the firm is continuously investing more funds, this makes no sense. Imagine investing $1,000 in a bank account, earning $50, and ending the year with $1,050 in the bank account. <i>What is the return?</i> If we use the average of the two bank account balances, our denominator is $1,025, making the return 4.88 percent ($50/$1,025). However, 4.88 percent is <a id="page_103"></a>incorrect. The return is also not 4.76 percent ($50/$1,050), computed with the ending bank account balance. Rather, the return is 5.00 percent ($50/$1,000), using the opening bank account balance. This is the return on the investment (you deposit $1,000 and get a $50 return).</p>
<p class="indent1">Often, year-end numbers are used because they are readily available and because being more precise would not result in a material difference. It is in fact true that when the opening and closing numbers are not materially different, using year-end instead of opening numbers will not affect the results significantly. Still, it is important to know and understand the choice that is being made about which numbers to use in order to understand the possible implications of that choice.</p>
<p class="h2">Activity Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent1">Activity ratios focus on the firm’s operations. Below are a few possible activity ratios:</p>
<p class="ul">Days receivable = receivables/(sales/365)</p>
<p class="ul">Days inventory = inventory/(cost of goods sold [COGS]/365)</p>
<p class="ul">Days payable = payables/(purchases/365)</p>
<p class="ul">Fixed asset turnover = sales/fixed assets</p>
<p class="ull">Total asset turnover = sales/total assets</p>
<p class="indent1">The first three ratios reflect how well a firm is managing its collections and inventory as well as how long the firm is taking to pay its suppliers. All else equal, the faster a firm collects and the lower the inventory days, the better the firm is thought to be managed. Days payable is a bit harder to interpret. Many analysts think the longer the payables the better, as long as there are no additional financing charges on the payables. However, suppliers have to cover their own costs of financing, so firms taking a long time to pay will likely see higher costs or may experience difficulties getting supplies. The last two ratios indicate the amount of fixed assets (property, plant, and equipment [PP&amp;E]), and total assets the firm needs in order to generate sales. Changes in these last two ratios are often related to changes in revenue. Again, all else equal, the higher the ratio the more efficient a firm is thought to be.</p>
<p class="h2"><a id="page_104"></a>Leverage Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent">Leverage measures how a firm has funded its resources: the split between debt and equity. It is a measure of long-term risk. All else equal, the greater the funding from debt, the greater the risk that the firm will be unable to repay the debt and the greater the probability of bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="indent1">Although there are many different ways to do the actual calculation, there are really two key differences in how this risk is calculated. One set of approaches counts only interest-bearing debt as debt (i.e., it excludes accounts payable, deferred taxes, and other such liabilities), whereas the other approaches include all liabilities as debt.</p>
<p class="ul">Debt/(debt + equity), this ratio includes only interest-bearing debt</p>
<p class="ul">Total liabilities/total asset</p>
<p class="ul">Total assets/owners’ equity</p>
<p class="ull">Times interest earned = earnings before interest and taxes/interest expense</p>
<p class="indent1">Note the second and third ratio above measure exactly the same thing. The second ratio may be more intuitive, whereas the third fits into the DuPont equation discussed below. The last ratio is an example of adapting a ratio to a specific user: Times interest earned is a banker’s ratio because it indicates whether a firm has enough funds to pay the interest on debt. A number less than one means the firm will not have enough funds to pay. The higher the number, the better the banker sleeps at night.</p>
<p class="h2">Liquidity Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent1">Liquidity is a measure of short-term risk. It considers whether the firm has the ability to pay its current debts as they come due. The two key liquidity ratios are:</p>
<p class="ul">Current ratio = current assets/current liabilities</p>
<p class="ull">Quick ratio = (cash + marketable securities + receivables)/current liabilities</p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_105"></a>The quick ratio is basically a more conservative version of the current ratio: it only includes those assets that could be quickly converted to cash if needed to repay the firm’s current debts. Thus, inventory and prepaid expenses are excluded from the quick ratio.</p>
<p class="h2">Other Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent">There are numerous other ratios that are used to evaluate the operations of a firm. For example, advertising expenses or research and development expenses as a percentage of sales. These ratios indicate whether a firm is trying to expand its market share and product line or perhaps is cutting back to improve short-term profits (potentially at the cost of long-term profitability). Coverage ratios, which use some measure of free cash flow to debt, are increasingly viewed as doing a better job of measuring a firm’s ability to repay its debt.</p>
<p class="indent1">Sales/employees and fixed assets/employees used to be very popular ratios. The idea was to measure the efficiency of employees (how much sales each employee generates and how much fixed assets are required per employee). Of course, a firm could improve these ratios simply by outsourcing, which would reduce the number of employees. This is why it is so important for analysts to examine any substantial change in ratios (in this case, the denominator) and its cause.</p>
<p class="h2">Common Size Financial Statements</p>
<p class="noindent">Dividing all financial statement numbers by sales produces what is called common size financial statements. Essentially, all components (line items) of the Income Statement and Balance Sheet are transformed into percentages of sales (i.e., are divided by sales). This allows for comparisons over time: comparing the individual firm to itself in other time periods as well as to other firms. Common size financial statements eliminate the impact of differences in size (e.g., Walmart could be compared to Sears) and provides a starting point for forecasts.</p>
<p class="indent1">An alternative formulation for the Balance Sheet is to divide all its numbers by total assets (i.e., all components of the Balance Sheet will be a percentage of total assets). Again, this allows for comparisons over time and across firms.</p>
<p class="h2"><a id="page_106"></a>DuPont Analysis</p>
<p class="noindent">The DuPont Model<a href="#c6n7" id="ic6n7"><sup>7</sup></a> says that a firm’s ROE is the product of its profitability (selling stuff for more than it cost), its capital intensity (selling stuff without using excess resources), and its financial leverage (financing well). These are measured by net income/sales, sales/total assets, and total assets/equity, respectively. (Total assets/equity is the less-than-intuitive leverage ratio introduced above, which you can now see fits nicely into the DuPont formula.) A firm can improve ROA using the first two levers and can improve ROE and using any of the three levers.</p>
<p class="indent1">DuPont Formula:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-106.jpg" width="492" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">ROE can be increased by an increase in profitability (net income/sales) and/or capital intensity (sales/total assets) and/or leverage (total assets/equity). If you calculate the cross products in the above equation, sales cancel with sales and total assets cancel with total assets, leaving you with ROE = net income/equity, or the net income return per dollar of equity. However, it is useful to consider each component of the DuPont Formula instead of just the simplified net income/equity, because each of the three levers is useful for analysis.</p>
<p class="h2">Window Dressing</p>
<p class="noindent">Window dressing is the term used for any short-term action that has no true economic rational and whose objective is simply to improve the appearance of the financial statements.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_107"></a>One possible way for a firm to do this is by changing the nature of the underlying accounting. For example, if a firm changed its “intent” to hold long-term marketable securities and instead wanted short-term holdings, the long-term investments would move up on the Balance Sheet and be included with current assets. This would improve the current ratio (by increasing the numerator with no impact on the denominator).</p>
<p class="indent">Another method to alter the appearance of the financial statements is by undertaking an economic action. One economic action is for a firm to take out a short-term loan at year-end to improve its current ratio. For example, assume a firm with $500,000 in current assets and $1 million in current liabilities takes out a $10 million short-term loan at the end of the year. The current ratio would improve from 50 percent ($500,0000/$1,000,000) to 95.5 percent ($10,500,000/$11,000,000). (Both the numerator and denominator go up by equal amounts, increasing ratios that were less than one and reducing ratios that were more than one.) Another economic action is for a firm to sell its accounts receivable (also called factoring) thereby improving the appearance of its days receivable. Additionally, a firm can sell some long-term assets (or do a sale and leaseback). This would increase cash, lower long-term assets, and potentially result in a gain or loss that would alter many ratios.</p>
<p class="indent">Analysts can adjust for window dressing by making their own decisions on the specific accounting numbers (as done in <a href="ch03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> on leases) and where the numbers should appear in the financial statements (e.g., short term or long term) before computing the ratios. A detailed example of extreme window dressing is presented in Appendix 6B, which outlines certain actions taken by Lehman Brothers shortly before its demise.</p>
<p class="indent1">The next section shows how financial analysis could have been done and what it may have revealed for Enron. The section after that describes the limitations of financial analysis in examining HubSpot.</p>
<p class="h2">Enron: Endless Possibilities to Mislead<a href="#c6n9" id="ic6n9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Enron was formed, or rather renamed, in April 1986 after a merger between InterNorth Inc. of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas Corporation <a id="page_108"></a>of Houston. Over time, the business changed from a regulated gas pipeline business with approximately 37,000 miles of pipe and a 1985 net loss of $14 million to a massive wholesale energy operation and service firm with year-end 2000 revenues of $101 billion and profits of $979 million.</p>
<p class="indent">Enron had many different businesses, which made interpreting its financials and ratios more difficult. The firm had a traditional business based on hard asset (the pipeline business as well as others). It also had an energy trading business (sort of a hedge fund). The firm was also engaged in numerous purchases of businesses which were accounted for with non-traditional accounting techniques as discussed below.</p>
<p class="indent">Enron Corporation filed for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. The firm’s stock price peaked at $90.38 (with a market capitalization of around $65 billion) on September 18, 2000, before falling to a low of $0.25 (with a market capitalization of $18 million) just 14.5 months later. Enron’s bankruptcy petition listed assets of $63.4 billion, making it the largest firm to ever file for bankruptcy until then.<a href="#c6n10" id="ic6n10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent1">Andrew Fastow, the firm’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), pled guilty to two counts of wire and securities fraud on January 14, 2004. His cooperation and testimony helped convict Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling, Enron’s top two executives, who were found guilty on May 25, 2006.<a href="#c6n11" id="ic6n11"><sup>11</sup></a> Before the Madoff scandal came to light in 2008,<a href="#c6n12" id="ic6n12"><sup>12</sup></a> Enron was the symbol of corporate greed and scandal.</p>
<p class="h2">Were there any red flags at Enron prior to the bankruptcy?</p>
<p class="noindent1">The first real public concerns about Enron were not raised until late September 2000, when a reporter for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> questioned <a id="page_109"></a>whether Enron’s revenue and profits were inflated.<a href="#c6n13" id="ic6n13"><sup>13</sup></a> This was followed by a March 2001 <i>Fortune</i> article entitled “Is Enron Overpriced?”<a href="#c6n14" id="ic6n14"><sup>14</sup></a> Even in this article, the reporter, Bethany McLean, was not questioning whether Enron was doing anything illegal but rather whether the market had fallen in love with the firm and overpriced it. The argument that the stock was overpriced was somewhat compelling. Ms. Mclean noted that Enron traded “at roughly 55 times trailing earnings. That’s more than two and a half times the multiple of a competitor like Duke Energy, more than twice that of the S&amp;P 500, and about on par with new-economy sex symbol, Cisco Systems.” The article noted how even <i>Wall Street</i> experts did not understand how Enron made its money or what the firm’s assets and investments were, let alone how they were valued. Even more surprising perhaps was how cash flows did not seem to reconcile with income.</p>
<p class="h2">Never Bite the Hand that Feeds You (or Why Firms Treat Analysts Well)</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a well-documented episode on April 17, 2001, Enron’s then Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Jeff Skilling, responded testily to an analyst’s question during a conference call.<a href="#c6n15" id="ic6n15"><sup>15</sup></a> Perhaps the love affair between Enron and <i>Wall Street</i> analysts had already started to fray, but many observers view this event as the turning point when analysts stopped accepting Enron’s pronouncements.</p>
<p class="h2">Were Enron’s Numbers Reasonable?</p>
<p class="noindent">Many elements of the Enron scandal focus on what was hidden or unapparent. However, there were also obvious reasons for concern, the <a id="page_110"></a>firm’s phenomenal revenue growth (from an already high revenue base) among them. Enron’s revenue grew from $13 billion during the year ending December 31, 1996, to a staggering $100 billion by the year ending December 31, 2000. This is an increase of more than 650 percent in four years, or an average annual growth rate of 65 percent. Even more stunning is the jump of over 150 percent in revenue from 1999 to 2000. In addition, Enron’s revenues for 2001 were initially on track to maintain this growth rate, with reported revenues reaching almost $140 billion in the first nine months of 2001.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>How did Enron generate such massive growth in reported revenue?</i> First, Enron counted the value of every trade it made as revenue. By contrast, the standard in the brokerage industry has always been to include only the fees earned on a trade as revenue. Enron’s practice allowed revenues to soar, although it did not inflate profits because the costs of the assets being traded were subtracted from the revenue, making gross profit equal to the amount in fees. As is often the case, Enron’s outside investors focused more on revenue growth than profit or cash flow growth. Thus, Enron’s revenue recognition practice helped propel the firm’s share price skyward. A review of Enron’s growth in revenue should have led to questions on how it was being obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, Enron used the accounting method of mark-to-market<a href="#c6n16" id="ic6n16"><sup>16</sup></a> to value many of its investments, including its energy contracts. As there was no active liquid market for these investments, Enron management estimated the value of these assets with estimates that were, at least in hindsight, exceedingly optimistic. It is important to understand that Enron was valuing these investments by discounting management’s estimates of future cash flows with management’s estimate of the appropriate discount rate. Anyone who has ever done a discounted cash flow analysis should understand how Enron could obtain the asset value it wanted to report by <a id="page_111"></a>altering its estimates of uncertain future cash flows as well as the discount rate it used. In addition, Enron recorded the net change in the asset value as profit, even though the asset had not actually been sold, and the only thing that had changed was Enron’s estimated market value for it.<a href="#c6n17" id="ic6n17"><sup>17</sup></a> A review of the assets listed on Enron’s financial statements should have led to questions on how they were being valued.</p>
<p class="indent">Dharan and Bufkins (2003) estimate that Enron’s revenue without these two techniques would have been “$6.3 billion in 2000 instead of the reported $100.8 billion. . . [and] would have pushed Enron down in the Fortune 500 list from number 7 to number 287.”<a href="#c6n18" id="ic6n18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">How did the auditors allow Enron to use these two techniques? Wouldn’t any competent first-year accounting student have seen the clear misrepresentation of economic events that was occurring with Enron’s accounting methods? What happened to the accounting principle of economic substance over legal form?</p>
<p class="indent1">Enron obtained approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (yes, the same SEC that somehow missed the Madoff scandal) to use mark-to-market accounting for its energy contracts in January 1992. Many other energy companies followed Enron’s lead and adopted the same accounting practice. This made the practice appear to be an acceptable standard for the industry well before 2000 (but any competent first-year accounting student, and certainly Enron’s auditors, should have argued it was misrepresenting the underlying economics, thereby violating the accounting principal of economic substance over legal form).</p>
<p class="h2">Enron’s Profitability Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent1">Concern should have also been raised when Enron’s profit margins dropped significantly even as reported revenues were skyrocketing (the <a id="page_112"></a>exact opposite of the economy of scale expected as firms grow). Enron’s profits grew from $584 million for the year ending December 31, 1996, to $979 million for the year ending December 31, 2000. This is an increase of almost 68 percent in four years or an average annual growth of just under 14 percent—an impressive rate by any standard. However, profits as a percentage of revenues (i.e., profit margins) were under 1 percent in year-end 2000, reflecting a 78 percent drop from the year-end 1996 profit margin of 4.4 percent. Any proper profitability analysis includes an examination of changes in revenues, gross margins, and net margins. In other words, do not just look at this year’s ratios: look at how the ratios have changed from last year. One has to wonder how such a precipitous drop in Enron’s profits did not raise fundamental questions, especially in light of the firm’s high growth in revenues.</p>
<p class="h2">Enron’s Activity Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent">On the surface, Enron appeared to be collecting payments from customers much more slowly, taking 38 days to collect in year-end 2000 as opposed to 28 days in year-end 1999. Analysts and auditors should have determined whether this reflected a problem with late payments from customers or the changing nature of Enron’s business.</p>
<p class="indent">Enron’s inventory appeared to have fallen as a percentage of COGS possibly indicating improved efficiency. However, this simplistic calculation was not appropriate for Enron’s changing business. First, the bulk of Enron’s revenue was increasingly derived from services provided rather than materials sold. In addition, however, the ratio’s denominator from the Income Statement would be cost of gas, electricity, metals, and other (which Enron included as COGS). Using inventory/COGS for Enron would not be a proper analysis because COGS included the costs of more than Enron’s inventory, so the numerator (inventory) and denominator (cost of inventory plus other things) were not an apples-to-apples comparison. A more detailed examination using information on the actual cost of material sold would have been required.</p>
<p class="indent">The increase in days payable, from 23 days in year-end 1999 to 38 days in year-end 2000, reflects Enron’s increasing use of suppliers to fund its growth. Delaying payment to suppliers is a type of short-term <a id="page_113"></a>financing (firms are able to use the money they would have given to suppliers to avoid borrowing that amount from a bank). However, delaying payments to suppliers too much can also be a sign of financial difficulties.</p>
<p class="indent1">Fixed asset turnover improved from 376 percent to 858 percent between year-end 1999 and 2000, while total asset turnover improved from 120 percent to 154 percent. These improvements in fixed and total asset turnover, occurred due to revenue (the numerator) increasing at a greater rate than assets (the denominator). Remember, fixed asset turnover is revenue/fixed assets and total asset turnover is revenue/total assets. <i>Were these improvements due to Enron being more efficient (generating more revenues with the same level of assets) or were the revenue increases driven by accounting choices as noted above?</i> A closer examination of Enron’s financials may have revealed it was the latter.</p>
<p class="h2">Enron’s Leverage Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent1">At first glance, the growth from 1999 to 2000 in interest expense (28 percent) seems to mirror the growth in debt (27 percent). Upon closer examination, Enron’s interest-bearing debt (short-term debt plus long-term debt) actually fell as a percentage of total assets. Enron appears to have funded the increase in assets (see <a href="#c6e3" id="ic6e3">Exhibit 6.3</a>) through suppliers (see the increase in payables noted above) and other deferrals, not through interest-bearing debt. This means the growth in interest expense was due to an increase in the interest rate rather than an increase in the underlying amount of debt. Since the U.S. interest rates had been somewhat constant over the 1999–2000 time period (10-year U.S. Treasury bonds yielded 4.72 percent in January 1999, 6.28 percent in December 1999, and 5.28 percent in December 2000), this might indicate that the debt markets were viewing Enron as increasingly risky (even if investors in Enron’s equity were not).<a href="#c6n19" id="ic6n19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p class="h2">Enron’s Liquidity Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent1">Enron’s current ratio was surprisingly stable and was just above one (its current assets were slightly more than its current liabilities). However, <a id="page_114"></a>sometimes it is suspicious when ratios do not change at all or when they are just at or slightly above some required level.</p>
<p class="h2">Enron’s DuPont Analysis</p>
<p class="noindent1">For Enron, we can see that a 56 percent drop in profit margin from year-end 1999 to year-end 2000 was offset by a 28 percent improvement in asset turnover and a 64 percent increase in leverage. The result is a net drop of 9 percent in ROE from 9.33 percent in 1999 to 8.54 percent in 2000.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-114.jpg" width="499" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="h2">Enron’s Cash Flows</p>
<p class="noindent">Enron’s cash flow from operating activities were $1.6 billion during the year ending December 31, 1998, or 228 percent of its net income of $703 million. By 2000, Enron’s cash flow from operating activities was $4.8 billion, or 490 percent of its net income of $979 million (cash flow from operations grew 191 percent compared to 39 percent growth in net income). Thus, Enron’s cash flow had more than doubled as a percentage of its net income. Over the same period, Enron’s revenues grew from $31.3 billion to $100.8 billion, which was a 222 percent increase. Analysts normally expect cash from operations to be higher than net income except during periods of rapid revenue growth, when cash from operations is expected to be below net income.<a href="#c6n20" id="ic6n20"><sup>20</sup></a> Given Enron’s rapid revenue growth from 1998 through 2000 (an average of almost 80 percent <a id="page_115"></a>per year), it should have been surprising that Enron’s cash from operations were substantially higher than net income and increasing. Rather than providing comfort, the high reported cash from operations and its growth should have been a reason to look at the cash flows more closely.</p>
<p class="indent1">In addition, Enron’s quarterly cash flow statements reveal another inconsistency. Most of the positive cash from operations occurred in the fourth quarter of the year. This begs the question: <i>Why did Enron’s cash flows improve so dramatically in the fourth quarter?</i></p>
<p class="h2">Executive Compensation at Enron</p>
<p class="noindent">At the time of the scandal, the impact of Enron’s compensation policies was not well known outside the firm. With hindsight, it is easy to see how the compensation plan set up by Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling was part and parcel of the Enron scandal. Essentially, Enron executives making deals were paid a bonus at the time the deal was signed, and the bonus was based on the difference between the net present value (NPV) of the deal’s future cash flows and the cost of the deal. This created powerful incentives for executives to make deals and present overly optimistic forecasts with positive NPVs. These forecasted present values were then used for the Balance Sheet valuations. The use of stock options for senior executives may also have fostered a climate where management felt the need to manipulate accounting information to maintain an ever-increasing stock price (as discussed in Appendix 6A).</p>
<p class="indent1">Clearly, certain executive compensation contracts provide greater incentives for management to manipulate accounting information than others. As such, if analysts can get the data, they should evaluate the nature of management’s incentives.</p>
<p class="h2">HubSpot: Where One Plus One Equals Three<a href="#c6n21" id="ic6n21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">HubSpot provides a very different example of financial analysis using a present-day firm with high growth and losses (in contrast to Enron, which <a id="page_116"></a>reported high growth and high profits). The key insights from the HubSpot analysis is that for many firms, especially those with high degrees of intellectual value (e.g., software, technology and pharmaceuticals), traditional financial metrics provide only limited help in understanding the firm’s underlying economics. Rather, in these firms, understanding the economics requires a much greater detailed understanding of the firm’s products and markets, as well as perhaps alternative measures of performance.</p>
<p class="indent1">HubSpot describes its business as follows:</p>
<p class="ext">“We provide a cloud-based marketing and sales software platform that enables businesses to deliver an inbound experience. An inbound marketing and sales experience attracts, engages and delights customers by being more relevant, more helpful, more personalized and less interruptive than traditional marketing and sales tactics. Our software platform features integrated applications to help businesses attract visitors to their websites, convert visitors into leads, close leads into customers and delight customers so that they become promoters of those businesses. These integrated applications include social media, search engine optimization, blogging, website content management, marketing automation, email, CRM, analytics and reporting.”<a href="#c6n22" id="ic6n22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Essentially, the founders’ key insight was that the traditional sales and marketing playbook had become less effective in our modern age as individuals increasingly ignored the media onslaught (e.g., television, radio, newspapers, robo calls, mass mailings, and mass emails). The idea behind HubSpot was for businesses to provide informative content that individuals were interested in through media that would capture their attention (e.g., through blogs which they would find with Google searches). Then, at some point, individuals desirous of a deeper insight would be asked (i.e., while reading the blog) to provide their contact information to receive additional information. Once the customer provided the contact information, the business could monitor how often and what material at its website was accessed <a id="page_117"></a>by the customer using HubSpot provided software. The business would then respond to these leads with a consultative sales approach on how their product could benefit the potential customer. For example, Midaxo (<a href="http://www.midaxo.com/">http://www.midaxo.com/</a>) provides cloud software to manage the merger-and-acquisition process from deal making through integration. Midaxo created an extensive learning center of valuable online content and uses HubSpot to develop customer leads.</p>
<p class="indent1">HubSpot did an initial public offering (the stock symbol is “HUBS”) on October 8, 2014, at a price of $25 per share issuing 750,000 shares and received net proceeds (after commissions) of $144.7 million. At the time of its initial public offering (IPO) in 2014 the firm had approximately 31.4 million shares outstanding, giving HubSpot a market capitalization of $785.8 million ($25 × 31.4 million). At the end of 2015, HubSpot had 34.3 million shares outstanding and a share price (at the close of the year on December 28, 2015) of $56.31, giving the firm a market capitalization of just under $2 billion ($56.31 × 34.3 million).</p>
<p class="h2">Are Hubspot’s Numbers Reasonable?</p>
<p class="noindent1">A review of HubSpot’s numbers and accounting choices do not reveal anything that could be described as “simply not possible.” For example, as discussed more fully below, the firm has been growing slightly faster than its major competitor, but well within what is seen as industry norms and easily supported by estimates of its potential market and share. Importantly, HubSpot’s business – how the firm generates revenues and profits – is well explained in its financial statements.</p>
<p class="h2">Hubspot’s Profitability Ratios from 2011 to 2015</p>
<p class="noindent">HubSpot is a rapidly growing, but non-profitable firm, which is typical of firms at this stage of their life cycle. As seen in <a href="#c6e8" id="ic6e8">Exhibit 6.8</a>, its revenue growth at 57% in 2015 is high, but it has fallen from 86 percent in 2011. Thus, while coming down somewhat (perhaps as expected), the firm emerged from 2015 still in a super-normal growth phase (one significantly above market rates which cannot be maintained over the long run). With <a id="page_118"></a>the exception of 2013, the growth in the cost of revenues (averaging 48 percent) was lower than the growth of revenues (averaging 65 percent).</p>
<p class="indent">To produce profits, costs must be lower than revenues. This is typically not the case for early stage, fast growing firms that generally incur losses as does Hubspot. However, the trajectory of revenue growth and cost growth offer insight into where the company might be headed. For Hubspot, with the exception of 2013, the growth in the cost of revenues (averaging 48 percent) was lower than the growth of revenues (averaging 65 percent). This resulted in an increase in the gross profit margin from 60 percent in 2011 to 74 percent in 2015. The growth in the firm’s operating cost from 2011 to 2015 averaged 55 percent and was also lower than the growth in revenues over the five years. However, despite HubSpot’s costs growing slower than revenues and the losses narrowing as a percentage, the firm’s losses still almost doubled from $24.4 million in 2011 to $46.1 million in 2015 and the firm ended 2015 with a cumulative deficit (negative retained earnings) of $200.3 million.<a href="#c6n23" id="ic6n23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Hubspot reports both GAAP and non-GAAP operating and net loss numbers. The difference in the two numbers is the estimated value of options in employee compensation, which is included in GAAP but excluded in non-GAAP. The analyst/investor thus has the ability to easily include or exclude the value of the deferred compensation when computing HubSpot’s profit or loss. (When estimating free cash flows, the non-cash compensation would be excluded.)</p>
<p class="indent">HubSpot’s revenues are derived primarily (92 percent) from subscriptions and secondarily (8 percent) from professional services. The subscriptions are paid in advance (HubSpot gets six to seven months upfront on average). Thus, when a subscription is paid, cash and a deferred revenue liability are increased. During the course of the subscription year, the deferred revenue liability is decreased and revenue is increased. The professional services are billed and recorded as revenue as the services are provided.</p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_119"></a>Return on assets and equity are not provided as they are not applicable for firms experiencing losses (i.e., firms that are not providing any positive returns).</p>
<p class="h2">Hubspot’s Activity Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent">Accounts receivable days grew significantly from 34.0 days in 2013 to 50.4 days in 2015. Given no deterioration in the overall economy, this could reflect HubSpot either easing credit terms to increase sales and/or increasingly selling to businesses that are less able to pay in the standard 30-day period. Both cases indicate some caution is warranted over the strength of revenues and their future growth rates. According to HubSpot, the biggest driver of this change is that HubSpot has steadily increased the proportion of payments from invoices versus credit cards, which in turn has increased billed months upfront and then A/R.</p>
<p class="indent">Accounts payable days fell from 33.8 days in 2013 to 19.7 days in 2015. This indicates the firm was paying its suppliers promptly (as opposed to many technology, which delay paying suppliers in order to fund operations).</p>
<p class="indent1">As with most technology firms (which rely on people rather than fixed assets), HubSpot’s high fixed asset turns indicate that the firm does not require a large investment in PP&amp;E to generate revenues. The much lower total asset turns is due to the large balance in investments that is effectively the firm’s cash reserves.</p>
<p class="h2">Hubspot’s Leverage and Liquidity Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent1">In 2015, the firm had virtually no interest-bearing debt and total liabilities were less than half (45 percent) of total assets. Combined with its current ratio of 160 percent in 2015, HubSpot does not appear to have any short-term financial constraints.</p>
<p class="h2"><a id="page_120"></a>HubSpot’s DuPont Analysis</p>
<p class="noindent">As with the profitability ratios, DuPont Analysis provides no insight for rapidly growing firms generating losses.</p>
<p class="h2">HubSpot’s Cash Flows</p>
<p class="noindent">As shown in <a href="#c6e7" id="ic6e7">Exhibit 6.7</a>, despite its large accounting loss, HubSpot is not bleeding cash (it used up $423,000) in 2015, which is a dramatic improvement in cash flow from operations (down from negative $12.5 million in 2014 and negative $19.8 million in 2013).</p>
<p class="indent">The difference between accounting profit (or loss) and cash flow from operations is that some of the costs incurred do not use up cash. In the case of HubSpot, the $7.3 million noncash depreciation expense, the $21.3 million noncash stock-based compensation expense, plus the $24.7 million deferred (prepaid) revenue are the prime factors in transforming HubSpot’s $46.1 million loss to a net cash used in operations of only $423,000. HubSpot’s annual cash flow statements also highlight that the firm raised $134.4 million in 2014 and another $36.9 million in 2015 (primarily through the proceeds of its IPO and a secondary stock offering).</p>
<p class="indent1">Thus, HubSpot appears to be heading toward positive cash flow from operations and has created a cushion (with the funds it raised) to cover future cash outflows.</p>
<p class="h2">HubSpot’s Other Ratios</p>
<p class="noindent1">HubSpot provides three other metrics it considers important in understanding the nature of its business. These are:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-120.jpg" width="490" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>HubSpot increased the number of customers by 35 percent in 2014 and 33 percent in 2015, while increasing the average revenue per customer by 15 percent in 2014 and 17 percent in 2015. This is how the firm generated its dramatic increase in revenues.</p>
<p class="indent">For Software as a Service (SaaS) firms like HubSpot, an alternative metric is: lifetime customer value (LTV) divided by the customer acquisition cost (CAC). The rule of thumb is that LTV should be at least three times the CAC and that it should take less than 12 months to recover the CAC (although a longer payback is acceptable if a firm has access to sufficient cash). The idea is that a firm should recover more than it cost to obtain a customer and should obtain do so rapidly.</p>
<p class="indent1">The formula to compute LTV is:<a href="#c6n24" id="ic6n24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p class="ul">LTV = MRR × margin/churn, where</p>
<p class="ul">MRR = the monthly recurring revenue</p>
<p class="ul">Margin = the profit margin on the software</p>
<p class="ull">Churn = customer defections or the percentage of customers lost per month</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-121.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent">HubSpot’s LTV more than doubled from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012 (and exceeded three times CAC), then it exploded up. A key reason is the dramatic reduction in churn (from 3.5 <a id="page_122"></a>percent to 1.5 percent).<a href="#c6n25" id="ic6n25"><sup>25</sup></a> HubSpot has improved its customer retention rate, thereby increasing the revenue each customer provides. However, the dramatic increase in the LTV resulting from an improvement in the customer retention rate also highlights the sensitivity of HubSpot’s value to small perturbations in the retention rate.</p>
<p class="h2">HubSpot by the Numbers</p>
<p class="noindent">HubSpot’s numbers indicate the firm should have no problems sustaining operations for several years even with continued losses. However, despite the improving cash flows, it is not clear at what point, or what economics are required, before HubSpot will turn a profit. This is an example of the limitations in what traditional financial analysis can provide for high-growth firms.</p>
<p class="indent">Alternative measures can help evaluate high-growth or software firms when traditional financial analysis is insufficient. The lifetime value of new customers and the cost to acquire are two alternative measures that can provide additional insights. Analysts/investors can also evaluate these types of firms by looking at changes in profit margins and cash flows. For example, software firms can be evaluated by looking at the sum of revenue growth plus cash flow margin<a href="#c6n26" id="ic6n26"><sup>26</sup></a> (cash flow margin tells us how quickly a firm converts sales into cash or at least does not burn its cash). Firms with a combined rate above 40 percent are considered top-ranking software firms.<a href="#c6n27" id="ic6n27"><sup>27</sup></a> HubSpot’s combined rate in 2015 was 57 percent: net income growth of 57 percent plus cash flow/sales of 0 percent.</p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_123"></a>As always, an in-depth understanding of the firm’s products and markets should always be obtained before estimating future cash flows.</p>
<p class="h2">Executives and the Board of Directors</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition to the analysis described above, many analysts will scrutinize the backgrounds and relationships of top executives and the board of directors to get a sense of whether management appears honest and capable as well as whether the board appears competent and independent. However, this does not always help analysts predict future failure or success.</p>
<p class="indent">Ken Lay, Chairman of Enron’s Board, had a Ph.D. in economics, a solid reputation, and a lengthy background in the industry. CEO Jeff Skilling also had a first-rate pedigree, with a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Harvard Business School and the claim of having been the youngest person to ever make partner at McKinsey &amp; Company, the esteemed consulting firm. The board of directors was comprised of Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and 15 other people, all of whom were esteemed members of the business community (including an accounting professor from Stanford). Without the benefit of hindsight, evaluating the senior management and board of directors of Enron would have led to the conclusion that they were among the best of any top public firm in the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">HubSpot’s board includes an array of exceptional board members. Its eight-member board includes six outside members (two who are in private equity/venture capital and four with senior management expertise) and two inside members (the two founders, one of whom is HubSpot’s CEO and the other is HubSpot’s Chief Technology Officer, both of whom are MIT graduates).</p>
<p class="h2">Growth and Financing</p>
<p class="noindent">To grow faster than its internal growth rate (i.e., faster than the growth that can be obtained via only profit retained for expansion), a firm must receive outside financing. The financing can be either debt or equity. As the firm’s percentage of financing from debt increases (i.e., its debt/total assets ratio goes up), the risk that the firm will be unable to repay its <a id="page_124"></a>debt goes up and its debt rating<a href="#c6n28" id="ic6n28"><sup>28</sup></a> goes down.<a href="#c6n29" id="ic6n29"><sup>29</sup></a> For a firm to maintain access to capital markets, it must normally earn an investment-grade debt rating from one of the major rating agencies. In Enron’s case, such an investment-grade rating was also critical for the firm to run its trading operations. Enron had to therefore ensure its rating remained at BBB (an investment-grade rating) or above.</p>
<p class="indent">Enron’s rapid growth was a key component of its high stock price, and management was focused on increasing the stock price further. Enron thus needed to continue expanding but needed to do so without increasing its debt/total asset ratio so that it could maintain its debt rating. To do this, Enron engaged in what is known as off-Balance Sheet financing. One method of Balance Sheet financing is to enter into operating leases (as discussed in <a href="ch03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>).<a href="#c6n30" id="ic6n30"><sup>30</sup></a> Although operating leases are off the Balance Sheet, they are disclosed in the Notes to the Financial Statements, so analysts can compute the NPV of all operating leases in order to increase assets and liabilities accordingly in their analysis. Instead of keeping debt off its Balance Sheet through operating leases, which analysts would have seen, Enron used Special Purpose Entities (SPEs). SPEs were originally designed to isolate the risk of a specific business operation and obtain financing for it while only reflecting the net investment on a firm’s Balance Sheet. For example, if Enron wanted to build a new power plant, the firm could create a separate <a id="page_125"></a>legal entity that would be managed independently and owned partially by Enron and partially by outside investors. As long as Enron met certain key accounting guidelines, the SPE would not be consolidated on the firm’s financial statements, thereby effectively limiting Enron’s legal liability for the power plant as well as keeping the SPE’s debt off the Balance Sheet. The SPE would own the assets and would finance them primarily with debt. From the debt-financing perspective, the SPE would appear to be low risk, even though it was financed almost entirely with debt, because it was leasing its assets to Enron, doing business with Enron, or had guarantees from Enron (a firm with an investment-grade rating). The SPE could sometimes even borrow at a rate below Enron’s marginal rate. Thus, Enron got assets (via the SPE) at a low interest rate without having to include the related debt on its books. SPEs can also be used when two or more firms structure a specific business deal. For example, Enron could build a power plant with a utility that guaranteed to buy all the electricity produced at a set rate.</p>
<p class="indent">The accounting standards in place at the time (which were changed after the Enron scandal) allowed a firm to avoid consolidating an SPE into the firm’s financial statements if the firm had no control over the assets of the SPE (i.e., if it was managed independently) and if a third party owned at least 3 percent of the SPEs equity. After the Enron scandal, accounting rules were changed to include greater disclosure of SPEs by requiring the consolidation of all subsidiaries where a firm controls more than 50 percent of the voting shares.</p>
<p class="indent1">In contrast, HubSpot financed itself with an IPO and secondary offering obtaining sufficient funds for at least several years of continued growth (and losses). HubSpot states it has no material off-Balance Sheet liabilities and, other than its marketable securities, does not use mark-to-market (fair value) accounting.</p>
<p class="h2">Prediction Using Accounting Data</p>
<p class="noindent">People have tried over the years to build models combining various individual accounting numbers and ratios, with the objective of obtaining one overriding value that could predict whether a corporation will meet its future obligations, determine whether the accounting data is reliable (of high quality), and predict the likelihood a firm is committing fraud. This section reviews all three.</p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_126"></a>Research on this task started in 1966 with the work of William Beaver, who demonstrated the ability of accounting variables to discriminate between bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms.<a href="#c6n31" id="ic6n31"><sup>31</sup></a> (One would be surprised if accounting ratios for bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms looked the same.) Edward Altman (in 1968) was the first to develop a model pre1624dicting which firms would go bankrupt and which would not. His model computed what he called a Z-score.<a href="#c6n32" id="ic6n32"><sup>32</sup></a> If a firm’s score was above 3.0 (later lowered to 2.7) the firm was considered “safe” (unlikely to file bankruptcy in the near future), while if the firm scored below 1.8 it was considered “risky” (likely to file bankruptcy in the near future). Firms with Z-scores between these two numbers were considered to be in a “gray” zone of uncertainty. The original (1968) equation is:<a href="#c6n33" id="ic6n33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p class="eq1"><i>Z</i> = 1.2<i>X</i><sub>1</sub> = 1.4<i>X</i><sub>2</sub> + 3.3<i>X</i><sub>3</sub> + 0.6<i>X</i><sub>4</sub> + 0.999 <i>X</i><sub>5</sub> where,</p>
<p class="ul"><i>X</i><sub>1</sub> = working capital/total assets</p>
<p class="ul"><i>X</i><sub>2</sub> = retained earnings/total assets</p>
<p class="ul"><i>X</i><sub>3</sub> = earnings before interest and tax/total assets</p>
<p class="ul"><i>X</i><sub>4</sub> = market capitalization/book value of debt</p>
<p class="ull"><i>X</i><sub>5</sub> = sales/total assets</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the subsequent research in this area has examined the percentage of firms whose outcomes were corrected predicted and has focused on: the appropriate statistical methods used to develop a bankruptcy prediction model; finding the accounting variables that best discriminate between bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms; and demonstrating the ability of a prediction model to outperform a naive model (e.g., lending to everyone).<a href="#c6n34" id="ic6n34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_127"></a>It is problematic that research on bankruptcy prediction models measures the accuracy of the models by counting the number of firms whose outcomes were predicted correctly. Let us explain what this means. Imagine a lender is trying to determine which of 100 firms that have applied for loans should be funded. Let us say a bankruptcy prediction model is built on prior data and claims to have an accuracy rate of 95 percent. If the prior data’s sample is of 100 firms and 50 went bankrupt while 50 did not, then a model accurately predicting 48 of the firms that went bankrupt and 47 of the firms that did not would have a 95 percent accuracy rate.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Is there anything wrong with this approach?</i> Several things. First, the sample that was tested does not reflect reality. Past experience in the real-world documents that only about 1 to 2 percent of large, established firms go bankrupt in a given year (the rate is much higher for smaller firms). So, for large firms at least, predicting all firms as non-bankrupt would result in an accuracy rate between 98 and 99 percent (the model would predict 100 percent of the non-bankrupts correctly and miss the 1 to 2 percent of the bankrupts). Second, the sample is often built and tested on itself. To properly measure accuracy, the model should be built using data from one period and tested on a future period. Finally, and most importantly, it is not the number of firms whose outcomes are correctly predicted that matters, but instead whether using the model increases a firm’s profitability (increased profitability is the ultimate goal).</p>
<p class="indent1">This means that to properly evaluate a prediction model it should be built using realistic data from a representative time period. The model should also consider the specific decision context of how the model will be used (i.e., an evaluation of whether by using the model a firm’s profitability will be increased). The last point means our evaluation of the model must include the impact of two types of incorrect decisions:</p>
<p class="ul">Type I errors: The impact of incorrectly predicting that a firm will not go bankrupt (e.g., the loss incurred from investing, selling, or lending to a firm that was predicted to not go bankrupt but does).</p>
<p class="ull"><a id="page_128"></a>Type II errors: The impact of incorrectly predicting a firm will go bankrupt (e.g., the profit forgone from not investing, selling, or lending to a firm that is predicted to go bankrupt but does not).</p>
<p class="indent">Type I errors become losses recognized for accounting purposes, while Type II errors are opportunity costs which are not recognized for accounting purposes.</p>
<p class="indent">A 2005 study by Weiss and Capkun (your author and a colleague) looked at bankruptcy prediction in a lending context and found that a model based on accounting variables was able to outperform (defined as increasing the bank’s profit) a naive model consisting of lending to all firms.<a href="#c6n35" id="ic6n35"><sup>35</sup></a> However, the model was only able to do so if Type I errors (incorrectly lending to firms which went bankrupt) were 25 times the cost of Type II errors (incorrectly not lending to firms which did not go bankrupt). That is, a prediction model would add value if a lender lost, say, 25 percent or more of the value of the loan made to a firm that did go bankrupt versus earning 1 percent or less of the value of the loan to a firm that did not go bankrupt. (Alternatively, if the profit was 4 percent or more on a good loan the loss on a bad loan would have to be over 100 percent of the loan for the model to add value).</p>
<p class="indent">Prediction models have more recently been used to measure the quality of accounting numbers (i.e., whether the numbers are relevant, consistent in their relationship to the underlying economics of a firm, and verifiable). The first study looking at this was published in 2005 and found that firms with higher accounting accruals earn lower returns and that the cash-based components of their earnings are more persistent (i.e., the cash-based components of their earnings can be used as a measure of the quality of earnings).<a href="#c6n36" id="ic6n36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent1">Another prediction model using accounting data created an index, called an MSCORE, where the higher the score the more likely a firm would fraudulently manipulate earnings:<a href="#c6n37" id="ic6n37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p class="eq1"><a id="page_129"></a>MSCORE = –4.84 + 0.920 × DSR + 0.528 × GMI + 0.404 × AQI + 0.892 × SGI + 0.115 × DEPI – 0.172 × SGAI + 4.679 × Accruals – 0.327 × LEVI</p>
<p class="ul">DSR = (receivables<sub><i>t</i></sub> /sales<sub><i>t</i></sub>)/(receivables<sub><i>t</i></sub><sub>−1</sub> /sales<sub><i>t</i></sub><sub>−1</sub>)</p>
<p class="ul">GMI = gross margin<sub><i>t</i></sub>/gross margin<sub><i>t</i></sub><sub>−1</sub></p>
<p class="ul">AQI = [1– (PP&amp;E<sub><i>t</i></sub> + CA<sub><i>t</i></sub>)/TA<sub><i>t</i></sub>]/[1 – (PP&amp;E<sub>t</sub><sub>−</sub><sub>1</sub> + CA<sub><i>t</i></sub><sub>−</sub><sub>1</sub>)/TA<sub><i>t</i></sub><sub>−</sub><sub>1</sub>]</p>
<p class="ul">SGI = sales<sub><i>t</i></sub> /sales<sub><i>t</i></sub><sub><i></i></sub><sub>−</sub><sub>1</sub></p>
<p class="ul">DEPI = depreciation rate<sub><i>t</i></sub><sub>−</sub><sub>1</sub>/depreciation rate<sub><i>t</i></sub></p>
<p class="ul">SGAI = (SGA<sub><i>t</i></sub> /sales<sub><i>t</i></sub>)/(SGA<sub><i>t</i></sub><sub>−</sub><sub>1</sub> /sales<sub><i>t</i></sub><sub>−</sub><sub>1</sub>)</p>
<p class="ul">Accruals = (income before extraordinary items – cash from operations)/total assets</p>
<p class="ull">Levi = leverage<sub><i>t</i></sub> /leverage<sub><i>t</i></sub> where leverage = debt/total assets</p>
<p class="indent1">The MSCORE appears to add value when Type I errors (the cost of missing a culprit, which means the cost of not correctly predicting a firm will go bankrupt) is 20 times Type II errors (incorrectly identifying an innocent firm, which means predicting the firm will go bankrupt when it does not do so in the end).</p>
<p class="h2">Back to Enron and Who Was to Blame</p>
<p class="noindent">The Enron scandal can be attributed to multiple parties. Management created the wrong incentives, acted in bad faith, and engaged in fraudulent practices. However, others were at best negligent and at worst complicit.</p>
<p class="indent">Enron’s auditing firm was Arthur Andersen, once one of the largest and most reputable of all accounting firms. It may never be known whether Andersen failed to properly conduct their audit from fear of losing Enron’s business (over $50 million in year-end 2000 alone) or was simply too close to a long-time cherished client and thus rationalized Enron’s arguments despite the problems and conflicts being obvious (albeit with hindsight). Regardless of the reason, the U.S. Justice Department indicted Andersen for obstruction of justice, and the firm and its 85,000 employees went out of business.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of Enron’s lawyers and those engaged in creating the SPEs should have seen the numerous questionable transactions and sounded an alert.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_130"></a>Enron’s bankers and brokers, like the auditors, were either intimidated by the threat of losing Enron’s lucrative business (i.e., the fees from underwriting new debt) or also rationalized away the clearly questionable deals and structures. Analysts, who should have sounded an early warning on Enron’s numbers, remained bullish on Enron’s shares well past any point of rationality.</p>
<p class="indent">The rating agencies failed, as they also did prior to the U.S. financial crisis of 2008, in not properly analyzing Enron and not alerting the public to Enron’s problems in a timely fashion.</p>
<p class="indent1">Finally, the investing public also bears some responsibility. As has been shown above, conducting a fundamental analysis of Enron would have exposed valuations that were out of proportion given the underlying numbers (and if you cannot understand how a firm is making money, you should probably not invest in it).</p>
<p class="h2">A Few Key Lessons from Enron</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>The folly of not providing the correct incentives:</b> Enron rewarded people for deals based on the NPV of estimated future cash flows at the time the deal closed. The extremely high rewards, not just for Enron but also for its bankers, auditors, and lawyers, made everyone willing to cut corners and ignore questionable practices.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>The creation of an inadequate corporate culture:</b> Enron did not openly discipline people for unethical behavior. Rather, Enron created a culture of open aggression.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Hubris:</b> Enron continually moved into new businesses, from gas to electricity to broadband.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>The failure to pay attention to the details:</b> Firms must carefully manage their growth. This becomes more critical at high growth rates, especially as Wall Street and investors come to expect the high growth to continue, thereby putting greater pressure on the management team to deliver, perhaps by any means. Rapid expansion without proper internal controls is a clear recipe for disaster. Enron focused on setting and then meeting targets, and no one ever really questioned how—no one ever really questioned the details.</p>
<p class="indent1">Overall, Enron claimed it was a new type of business with explosive revenues and new accounting techniques. However, the profit margins were out of line with revenues, the cash flow from operations was substantially above <a id="page_131"></a>net income despite rapid expansion, and the Balance Sheet defied explanation. An honest, thorough assessment would have noted numerous reasons to be suspicious that the firm was presenting a heavily airbrushed image.</p>
<p class="h2">A Few Key Lessons from HubSpot</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Traditional financial analysis does not always provide key insights into a firm’s economic drivers.</b> High-growth firms, as well as those with large intellectual property components, can be hard to value using traditional financial analysis. However, one can still compare a firm’s growth and cost structure to those of its competitors and other comparable firms (e.g., SaaS companies in different industries may still have similar financial characteristics).</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Alternative measures</b> like the number and value of new contracts, costs to acquire customers, and retention rates are often useful to estimate future cash flows.</p>
<p class="indent1">As always, <b>an in-depth understanding</b> of the firm’s products and markets should be obtained prior to any estimation of future cash flows.</p>
<p class="h2">The Bottom Line</p>
<p class="noindent1">Financial analysis is a starting point in understanding the basic economics of a firm. It provides an assessment of:</p>
<p class="noindent">How a firm generates profits and returns;</p>
<p class="noindent">The components of its operations;</p>
<p class="noindent">The stability of its operations over time;</p>
<p class="noindent">The resources it has under its control;</p>
<p class="noindent">How it has changed over time;</p>
<p class="noindent">How it is financed; and,</p>
<p class="noindent1">The risk of not meeting its debts as they come due.</p>
<p class="indent">Financial analysis can indicate whether there are any red flags or areas of concern as well as potential opportunities.</p>
<p class="indent">The next chapter ends the book with a discussion of some of the unique methods used in the accounting of governmental and nonprofit organizations.</p>

This contrasts with historical cost accounting, which lists assets and liabilities at their historical cost values (often with downward adjustments). One key problem with mark-to-market accounting is determining the market value of items that are not actively traded in a market (e.g., a power plant) because it forces management to use estimates and assumptions.</p>

<p class="fn" id="c6n25"><a href="#ic6n25"><sup>25</sup></a>It is also important to note that churn (i.e., customer defections) becomes more important as firms grow in size: the greater the raw number of customers leaving means more customers have to be replaced. Ideally, the revenue from current customers will grow beyond that of those leaving, creating a negative churn. Finally, to have a complete picture of the firm’s revenues, churn should be computed both for revenue and for the number of customers.</p>

<p class="fn" id="c6n28"><a href="#ic6n28"><sup>28</sup></a>As noted in <a href="ch04.xhtml">chapter 4</a>, there are three major rating agencies: Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch. Each has a slightly different rating mechanism, but for all three the safest rating is AAA, followed by AA+ through D, with D meaning the firm is in default or not currently paying its interest and principal as per its debt contract(s). BBB (Baa2 for Moody’s) and above is considered an investment-grade rating. BB and below is considered high-yield or junk status.</p>
<p class="fn" id="c6n29"><a href="#ic6n29"><sup>29</sup></a>For example, if a firm has $1,000 in total assets, $600 in debt, and $400 in equity, it will have debt/total assets ratio of 60 percent. If the firm borrows $200 and buys more assets, total assets goes to $1,200, debt goes to $800, and equity remains at $400, so the debt/total assets ratio is now 67 percent.</p>
