<p class="ct"><a href="05_Contents.xhtml#toc6">The Time Value of Money</a><a href="#c2n1" id="ic2n1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent1">For both accounting and finance, it is critical to understand the time value of money. This chapter begins with a review of compounding and discounting and then extends the discussion to explain the concept of net present value (NPV), why it is superior to other valuation methods (namely, the internal rate of return and payback) and reviews perpetuities (payments that continue forever) and their usefulness in valuation.</p>
<p class="h1">Discounting and Compounding</p>
<p class="noindent">The time value of money is one of the most powerful concepts in finance. It is a concept that small children express when they say, “I want it now, not later, now!” Quite simply, the idea is that a dollar today (or anything, for that matter) is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.</p>
<p class="indent">Taking an amount today and computing what it will be worth in the future is called compounding. Taking an amount in the future and figuring out what it would be worth today is called discounting. Compounding and discounting are inverses of each other.</p>
<p class="indent">An easy way to start the explanation of the time value of money is to consider a bank account. <i>If you invest $100 in a bank account at the start of the year and earn 5 percent annual interest on your funds during the course of the year, how much will you have at the end of the year?</i> You will have $105, which is your original deposit of $100 plus the interest of $5 that you earned during the year ($100 × 5 percent). This means that with a 5 percent interest rate, $100 today is equivalent to $105 in a year. Conversely, $105 in a year is worth $100 today at that interest rate.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_34"></a><i>What if you leave the $105 in the bank for a second year, again earning 5 percent? How much would you have at the end of the second year?</i> You would have $110.25. You start the second year with $105 and earn an additional $5.25 of interest during the second year ($105 × 5 percent). You earned more in interest during the second year ($5.25) than in the first year ($5.00) because you began the second year with more money. In the second year, you earned $5 interest on the original $100 plus an additional $0.25, which is 5 percent interest on the $5 that you earned the first year. In the second year, you are earning interest on your interest. This example also means that $110.25 in 2 years is worth $100 today.</p>
<p class="indent1">We can represent the above visually with the following time line:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-34a.jpg" width="505" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">We will consider today to be the present, so the $100 is our present value (or PV for short). The $105 value is a future value (FV), as is the $110.25. To differentiate between the two, we call the $105 the FV at time 1 (FV<sub>1</sub>) and the $110.25 the FV at time 2 (FV<sub>2</sub>). We can relabel our time line as follows:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-34b.jpg" width="506" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">The 5 percent is our interest rate, denoted as <i>r</i> (also sometimes denoted as <i>i</i>). This allows us to put our time line into a formula:</p>
<p class="eq">FV<sub>1</sub> = PV × (1 + <i>r</i>) → $105.00 = $100 × (1 + 5%)</p>
<p class="eq1">FV<sub>2</sub> = FV<sub>1</sub> × (1 + <i>r</i>) → $110.25 = $105 × (1 + 5%)</p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_35"></a>We use algebraic substitution to get:</p>
<p class="eq1">FV<sub>2</sub> = FV<sub>1</sub> × (1 + <i>r</i>) = PV × (1 + <i>r</i>) × (1 + <i>r</i>) = PV × (1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="indent">In the above example, $110.25 = $100 × (1.05)<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="indent1">We can generally write that for any future period <i>n</i>:</p>
<p class="eq1">FV<sub><i>n</i></sub> = PV × (1 + <i>r</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup></p>
<p class="indent">where, at an interest rate of <i>r</i> per period, the FV<sub><i>n</i></sub> n periods from now is equal to the current value times (1 + <i>r</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">This compounding of a PV into a FV is a concept familiar to most, including those not involved in finance. We encounter this regularly when we put money in the bank and collect interest.</p>
<p class="indent">Discounting a FV to a PV is usually new to those unfamiliar with finance. It is, however, as noted above, the inverse of compounding. Mathematically, it works as follows:</p>
<p class="indent1">We divide both sides of the equation FV<sub><i>n</i></sub> = PV × (1 + <i>r</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup> by (1 + <i>r</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup> to get the PV:</p>
<p class="eq1">PV = FV<sub><i>n</i></sub>/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup></p>
<p class="indent1">Using the numbers from our example above, discounting FV<sub>2</sub> of $110.25 backward for 2 years at an interest rate of 5 percent gives us $100 today.</p>
<p class="eq1">PV = $110.25/(1.05)<sup>2</sup> = $100</p>
<p class="indent2">This is the essence of compounding (going forward), discounting (bringing backward), and the time value of money. Note, there are four different ways to compute present and future values: (1) Using formulas (as done above); (2) using tables with the amounts already calculated (e.g., the table would provide (1.05)<sup>2</sup> = 1.1025); using a financial calculator (where the information is inserted and the answer provided); and (4) using a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel). Both the formula and spreadsheet approaches will be presented below.</p>
<p class="h1"><a id="page_36"></a>Net Present Value (NPV)</p>
<p class="noindent">In finance, investment decisions are often expressed in terms of NPV. If the NPV is positive, all else equal (e.g., there are no other legal, ethical, or environmental issues) it is considered a good investment. If the NPV is negative, all else equal, it is considered a bad investment. <i>What is an NPV?</i> It is the present value of all of the investment’s cash flows, including both inflows and outflows. <i>What is the required discount rate?</i> It is the market rate given the riskiness of the future cash flows. Normally, investments require an initial payment (i.e., a cash outflow) followed by a series of returns (i.e., a series of cash inflows).</p>
<p class="indent1">Let’s return to a bank account example above where $100 is deposited into the bank at an interest rate of 5 percent compounded annually and assume all the funds are withdrawn at the end of the first year. The NPV would be calculated as follows: An initial cash outflow of $100 to the bank is followed in one year by a cash inflow of $105 when all the funds are withdrawn. The NPV is the present value of these two cash flows. The present value of $100 deposited today is $100, and because it is an outflow, it is included as –$100 in the sum. The present value of the $105 inflow in one year is $100, which is calculated by discounting $105 backward one year using a 5 percent interest rate. The NPV is therefore $0 (or –$100 + $100). As a formula it would be:</p>
<p class="eq1">NPV = Cash Flow<sub>0</sub> + Cash Flow<sub>1</sub>/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>1</sup> + Cash Flow<sub>2</sub>/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>2</sup> + . . . + Cash Flow<sub><i>n</i></sub>/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Note that any individual cash flow can be positive or negative. A cash inflow is positive and a cash outflow is negative.</p>
<p class="indent1">In this case, it is:</p>
<p class="eq1">NPV = –$100 + $105/(1.05)<sup>1</sup> = –$100 + $100 = $0</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-36.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_37"></a>A $0 NPV does not mean the investment does not earn a return. Rather, it means that the investment earns a competitive return, one that can be obtained elsewhere. If the interest rate truly is 5 percent, investing $100 today to receive $105 in a year is neither a good investment nor a bad investment. It is a fair return, the investor earns 5 percent and has an NPV of $0. Assume, however, that instead of investing the $100 in the bank, a firm could invest the $100 in new equipment (with the same risk as the bank) and obtain $110 in a year. The NPV of investing in the new equipment would be $4.76 (calculated as –$100+ ($110/1.05<sup>1</sup>)). This is a positive NPV. If the risk of being repaid is the same, the second investment is preferred to the first because it has a higher NPV.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, in bond valuation, the NPV of a bond is zero.<a href="#c2n2" id="ic2n2"><sup>2</sup></a> This means the current price of the bond (the cash outflow today) is set to equal the discounted future coupon payments and the par value at the end of the bond’s life (the cash inflows) at the current market discount rate. As the discount rate decreases (increases) the price of the bond increases (decreases). The NPV of the bond is always zero as the price of the bond adjusts with changes in the market interest rate.</p>
<p class="indent1">NPV is used to guide investment decisions as follows: A positive NPV means that the future returns on the investment are greater than the risk the firm assumes. A negative NPV means that the future returns on the investment are less than the risk the firm takes on. A negative NPV does not mean the total future cash flows are less than the initial investment (i.e., it does not mean, for instance, that we invest $100 and later get $90). It instead means that the future cash flows are not high enough to justify the initial investment given the required return. Investments with positive NPVs are potentially attractive unless there are legal, ethical, or environmental reasons not to undertake them. Likewise, investments with negative NPVs are potentially unattractive unless there are legal, ethical, or environmental reasons to undertake them.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_38"></a>NPV &gt; $0 A potentially attractive investment.</p>
<p class="noindent">NPV = $0 An investment earning a competitive return.</p>
<p class="noindent1">NPV &lt; $0 A potentially unattractive investment.</p>
<p class="indent1">For example, assume a series of cash flows can be generated from an initial investment of $1 million.<a href="#c2n3" id="ic2n3"><sup>3</sup></a> Visually, this is:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-38a.jpg" width="499" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="noindent1">Using a discount rate of 6 percent, the NPV will be $39,531 (or –$1 million + $1,039,531).<a href="#c2n4" id="ic2n4"><sup>4</sup></a> If you find a project with these expected cash flows and interest rate, you should be willing to pay $1 million for it because it is a project with a positive NPV.<a href="#c2n5" id="ic2n5"><sup>5</sup></a> In tabular form it is:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-38b.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="h1"><a id="page_39"></a>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</p>
<p class="noindent">The internal rate of return (IRR) is sometimes advocated as an alternative investment rule to NPV. IRR is the discount rate that makes the NPV of all cash flows equal 0. The IRR is compared to a threshold-required rate. If, all else equal, the IRR is above the required rate it is a good investment; if lower it is a bad one.</p>
<p class="indent1">Using the NPV formula, we set the NPV equal to zero and solve for <i>r</i><a href="#c2n6" id="ic2n6"><sup>6</sup></a>:</p>
<p class="eq1">NPV = $0 = Cash Flow<sub>0</sub> + Cash Flow<sub>1</sub>/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>1</sup> + Cash Flow<sub>2</sub>/(1+<i>r</i>)<sup>2</sup> + . . . + Cash Flow<sub><i>n</i></sub> /(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Cash Flow<sub>0</sub> is the initial investment, Cash Flow<sub>1</sub> is the return in one year, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">The IRR is the value of <i>r</i> that makes NPV equal zero. After solving for the IRR, it is compared to the firm’s threshold or required return, normally called a hurdle rate, on an investment with similar risk. Management sets the firm’s required return at some percentage above the firm’s cost of capital.<a href="#c2n7" id="ic2n7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent1">The decision rule with IRR is:</p>
<p class="noindent">IRR &gt; the firm’s hurdle rate Earns more than a competitive return.</p>
<p class="noindent">IRR = the firm’s hurdle rate Investment earns a competitive return.</p>
<p class="noindent1">IRR &lt; the firm’s hurdle rate Earns less than a competitive return.</p>
<p class="indent">Intuitively, the IRR approach to evaluating possible investments means that if a project earns a return equal to or greater than the firm’s required return, it is a potentially good investment (as long as there are no legal, ethical, or environmental reasons to reject it). Otherwise, it is not.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_40"></a>In the example of $100 deposited in the bank earning a 5 percent interest rate with $105 being withdrawn at the end of that first year, the investment has an IRR of 5 percent because the NPV (as shown above) is zero. Because the IRR of 5 percent equals the required return of 5 percent, the investment earns a competitive return.</p>
<p class="indent1">Now let us use the example of a $1-million investment today and a $300,000 cash inflow once a year, at the end of the year, for four years. Also, assume, as we did before, a discount rate of 6 percent. If we apply the IRR formula:</p>
<p class="eq">NPV = $0 = Cash Flow<sub>0</sub> + Cash Flow<sub>1</sub>/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>1</sup> + Cash Flow<sub>2</sub>/ (1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>2</sup> + . . . + Cash Flow<sub><i>n</i></sub>/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup></p>
<p class="eq1">$0 = –$1 million + $300,000/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>1</sup> + $300,000/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>2</sup> + $300,000/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>3</sup> + $300,000/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>4</sup></p>
<p class="indent">Solving for <i>r</i> we get 7.714 percent.<a href="#c2n8" id="ic2n8"><sup>8</sup></a> This is the IRR. Remember, an IRR of 7.714 percent means that a 7.714 percent discount rate makes the NPV equal zero. If the IRR is above the firm’s hurdle rate, say 6 percent, the project is considered a good investment. Essentially, if the firm can borrow against this project at a rate of 6 percent and expects to earn 7.714 percent, it is a good investment.</p>
<p class="indent1">In tabular form: (<i>r</i> = 7.714%):</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/img-40.jpg" width="498" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="h2"><a id="page_41"></a>Which to Use: IRR or NPV?</p>
<p class="noindent">IRR and NPV usually recommend the same decision. In the bank example above, the investment was a zero NPV, and the IRR equaled the required rate of return. This means the investment opportunity (i.e., depositing in the bank) provides a competitive (fair) return given the risk.</p>
<p class="indent">In the annuity example above, the IRR is above a firm’s hurdle rate of 6 percent, and the NPV is positive. This means the annuity example is a good investment opportunity. If the IRR is below a firm’s hurdle rate, the NPV is usually negative, and this would mean the investment opportunity is a bad one.</p>
<p class="indent1">However, sometimes IRR and NPV give different results or a different ranking for multiple investment projects (e.g., a different listing of the best to worst investment). <i>Which rule should a firm follow?</i> NPV is the preferred investment rule.</p>
<p class="h3"><i>Why is NPV preferred over IRR as a way of evaluating investments?</i> Four reasons:</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>First, IRR ignores the scale of a project.</b> For example, two projects may have the same IRR (e.g., 15 percent) but one may be a small project (a $100,000 investment returning $115,000 in one year), while the other may be much larger (a $1 million investment returning $150,000 a year for 20 years). Assume the firm’s hurdle rate is 12 percent. If the firm is only going to invest in one project, it seems obvious that a firm would prefer $150,000 a year for 20 years. The IRRs are the same, while the NPVs are not. Let us examine this situation more closely.</p>
<p class="indent">Setting the NPV to zero and solving for <i>r</i> below, we find that both investment projects have the same IRR of 15 percent ($0 = Cash Flow<sub>0</sub> + Cash Flow<sub>1</sub>/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>1</sup> . . . + Cash Flow<sub><i>n</i></sub>/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup>).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Small project:</p>
<p class="eq1">$0 = –$100,000 + ($115,000/ (1 + <i>r</i>)), <i>r</i> = 15%</p>
<p class="noindent1">Large project:</p>
<p class="eq1">$0 = –$1 million + ($150,000/(1 + <i>r</i>)) + ($150,000/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>2</sup>) + . . . + ($150,000/(1+<i>r</i>)<sup>20</sup>) + ($1 million/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>20</sup>), <i>r</i> = 15%</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_42"></a>However, the NPV’s are different. We use the firm’s hurdle or discount rate of 12 percent (<i>r</i> = 12%):</p>
<p class="noindent1">Small project:</p>
<p class="eq">NPV =–$100,000 + ($115,000/(1.12))</p>
<p class="eq1">NPV = $2,679</p>
<p class="noindent1">Large project:</p>
<p class="eq">NPV = –$1 million + ($150,000/(1.12)) + ($150,000/(1.12)<sup>2</sup>) + . . . + ($150,000/(1.12)<sup>20</sup>) + ($1 million/(1.12)<sup>20</sup>)</p>
<p class="eq1">NPV = $224,083</p>
<p class="indent1">Although both projects earn 15 percent, the second project has a much larger NPV and would therefore be preferred.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Second, the NPV of a project changes as the discount rate used changes, while the IRR does not.</b> This becomes important when comparing two projects. Consider two possible investments, both requiring an initial outlay of $1 million today. Investment A returns $1,688,950 in four years. Investment B returns $357,375 each year for four years.</p>
<p class="indent1">Investment A:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-42a.jpg" width="502" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent1">Investment B:</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-42b.jpg" width="502" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_43"></a>Investment A has an IRR of 14 percent ($0 = –$1,000,000 + $1,688,950/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>4</sup>), whereas investment B has an IRR of 16 percent ($0 = $1,000,000 + $357,375/(1 + <i>r</i>) + $357,375/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>2</sup> + $357,375/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>3</sup> + $357,375/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>4</sup>). This would imply the firm should accept the second project as it has the higher IRR. The results of the IRR evaluation would be the same regardless of the firm’s hurdle rate. Using IRR as a decision rule, investment B is always preferred to investment A.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, the NPV answer changes at different discount rates. At low discount rates, of 11 percent or less, the NPV of project A is greater than that of project B. At higher discount rates, of 12 percent or more, the NPV of project B is greater than that of project A. (See the details below.) Eventually, the discount rate will become so high that both projects have negative NPVs.</p>
<p class="indent1">In the example, the IRR of B is greater than the IRR of A. However, the NPV of B is not always greater than the NPV of A because the NPV depends on the actual discount rate used. Thus, if we are forced to choose between the two projects, using NPV may give a different answer than IRR.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-43.jpg" width="508" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Third, the example of Investments A and B is dependent on a very important feature embedded in the use of IRR: it assumes that all cash flows received are reinvested at the IRR.</b> This is often an unrealistic assumption and another reason why NPV is superior to IRR. In particular, if IRR is very high (which would cause a firm to normally consider the project to be a good investment), it is unlikely that cash flows from the project can be reinvested at that rate.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_44"></a>Again, using our two projects above:</p>
<p class="noindent1">Project A</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-44a.jpg" width="503" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="noindent1">Project B</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="../images/img-44b.jpg" width="502" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Project A returns $1,688,950 at the end of Year 4 for an IRR of 14 percent.</p>
<p class="noindent">Project B returns $357,375 a year for four years for an IRR of 16 percent.</p>
<p class="noindent1">However, assume the payments from project B can only be reinvested to earn 11 percent. <i>What is the future value on December 31, 2020 of project B’s four payments?</i> It is:</p>
<p class="eq1">$357,375 × 1.11<sup>3</sup> + $357,375 × 1.11<sup>2</sup> + $357,375 × 1.11<sup>1</sup> + $357,375 = $1,683,140</p>
<p class="indent1">Thus, if discount rates change, the IRR rule can lead to a suboptimal decision.</p>
<p class="noindent2"><b>Finally, the IRR of a project is not necessarily unique.</b> Solving for IRR is simply solving a polynomial equation. As such, every time the cash flows change signs (i.e., outflows being negative and inflows positive), there is an additional IRR solution (an additional root).<a href="#c2n9" id="ic2n9"><sup>9</sup></a> If an investment has cash flow out and then cash flow in (as the examples above do), this equals one sign change, one root, and thus one IRR solution. However, if an investment has cash flow out, then cash flow in, and then cash flow out again, this equals two sign changes, two roots, and two IRR solutions. Therefore, for many investments that require an initial cash outlay and <a id="page_45"></a>then future cash flow investments (perhaps maintenance payments), IRR does not give a unique solution. NPV, on the other hand, gives a single solution each time.</p>
<p class="h1">Payback</p>
<p class="noindent1">As long as we are dealing with investment rules, we should also mention “payback.” Though not used by many firms today, in the past, this was a popular technique for evaluating investment projects. It is still used by many households and individuals when considering personal investments. Payback evaluates a project by measuring the time until the initial investment in the project is repaid. In our second example above, payback is 2.8 years. The $1,000,000 initial investment has a cash flow of $357,375 a year for four years, so it is repaid after 2.8 years (i.e., $1,000,000/$357,375). The rule is to choose whichever project has the shorter payback. This method sounds reasonable, and it often is.</p>
<p class="h3">Where does payback go wrong?</p>
<p class="noindent">Payback does not consider the market rate of return or the time value of money. In payback, a dollar in three years is equal to a dollar in ten years or a dollar today. We know this is not true. In a simple example, consider two projects, A and B, both with a $1-million investment today. Project A returns $800,000 the first year and $200,000 the second. Project B returns $200,000 the first year and $800,000 the second. They both have the identical payback of two years, but they have very different values to the firm. By this point in the chapter, you should recognize that project A has a higher NPV than does project B. Even though the total cash flows of the two projects are equal, project A returns four times as much in the first year. Because of discounting and/or compounding, we know money in one year is worth more than money in two years. The NPV rule captures this difference in value, while the payback rule does not.</p>
<p class="indent2">This does not mean that payback does not give the right answer under the right circumstances. For example, up until the early 1990s, Procter and Gamble (P&amp;G) used payback as part of its project evaluation. This worked for P&amp;G because most of its products were similar consumer <a id="page_46"></a>goods with similar risks and cash flow profiles. P&amp;G made an investment, advertised, and rolled out the product. Products with similar risk profiles meant the products basically had similar discount rates, and so the rank ordering of projects by payback was identical to the rank ordering of projects by NPV. Thus, P&amp;G, through experience, could rank order projects and determine whether the payback period was short enough to make the investment a good one. In this instance, using the payback period allowed them to essentially determine if the project had a positive NPV or not.</p>
<p class="h1">Cash Flows with Unequal Lives</p>
<p class="noindent">One frequent problem in finance is how to compare cash flows with different lives. This arises if a project has to be replaced at the end of its useful life. For example, imagine a homeowner has to replace a roof and can use shingles (which last 20 years) or slate (which last 30 years).</p>
<p class="indent"><i>How do you compare the choice between shingles and slate, as they are assets with different lives? Is it still correct to simply choose the higher NPV?</i> No, it is not correct to simply compare the NPV of the two different choices (projects). <i>Why not?</i> Because using shingles requires replacing them ten years sooner (in 20 years) than using slate (which would get replaced in 30 years). The homeowner cannot go without a roof for years 21 through 30. There are two ways to handle this issue:</p>
<p class="indent">The first is to make the time period the same for both projects. This is called “common years.” If you have a 20-year project and a 30-year project, you take both out for 60 years (i.e., find the lowest common multiple of the two different project periods). This means using the present value of three consecutive 20-year projects compared to the present value of two consecutive 30-year projects and then selecting whichever series of projects has the higher NPV.</p>
<p class="indent">The second way to handle evaluating assets with different lives is by computing what is called the “equivalent annual cost” (sometimes called the “equivalent annual revenue”). This method is somewhat analogous to computing the IRR (remember that the IRR is the discount rate that causes the cash flows to have an NPV equal to zero).</p>
<p class="indent1">Equivalent annual cost calculates the annual cash flows in our NPV equation necessary to make the NPV = $0 (given what the initial cash <a id="page_47"></a>outlay and the market discount are). Note, the NPV method of evaluating investments uses projected cash flows and a market discount rate to see if an investment provides a positive return. By contrast, the IRR method of evaluating investments solves the same equation for the discount rate, the <i>r</i>-value, that makes the NPV = $0 (in this case, the initial cash investment and the cash flows). Equivalent annual cost uses the same NPV formula as in the IRR method, with NPV set to zero, but this time we are solving for a different variable (cash flows). We are using the NPV formula in a different way to allow us to compare cash flows with different time periods.</p>
<p class="eq1">$0 = Cash Flow<sub>0</sub> + Cash Flow<sub>1</sub>/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>1</sup> + Cash Flow<sub>2</sub>/(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup>2</sup> + . . . + Cash Flow<sub><i>n</i></sub> /(1 + <i>r</i>)<sup><i>n</i></sup>,</p>
<p class="noindent">where <i>r</i> is given and you solve for the cash flows.</p>
<p class="indent1">For example, imagine the following comparison:</p>
<p class="ul">Project 1: initial capital outlay of $100 million, 10-year life, and 10 percent discount rate.</p>
<p class="ull">Project 2: initial capital outlay of $160 million, 15-year life, and 10 percent discount rate.<a href="#c2n10" id="ic2n10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent1">This is solved with the following comparison:</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Project 1:</i></p>
<p class="ul">$0 = –$100 million + cash flow × (1/1.10 + 1/1.10<sup>2</sup> + 1/1.10<sup>3</sup> + . . . + 1/1.10<sup>9</sup> +1/1.10<sup>10</sup>)</p>
<p class="ul">$0 = –$100 million + cash flow × ∑<sub>1</sub><sup>10</sup> (1/(1.10)<sup><i>n</i></sup>)</p>
<p class="ul">$100 million = cash flow × ∑<sub>1</sub><sup>10</sup> (1/(1.10)<sup><i>n</i></sup>) = cash flow × (6.1446)</p>
<p class="ul">$100 million/6.1446 = cash flow</p>
<p class="ull">$16.3 million/year = cash flow</p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_48"></a>Thus, the equivalent annual cost for Project 1 is $16.3 million.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Project 2:</i></p>
<p class="ul">$ 0 = –$160 million = cash flow × ∑<sub>1</sub><sup>15</sup> (1/(1.10)<sup><i>n</i></sup>) = cash flow × (7.6061)</p>
<p class="ul">$ 0 = –$160 million/7.6061 = cash flow</p>
<p class="ull">$21.0 million/year = cash flow</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the equivalent annual cost for Project 2 is $21.0 million.</p>
<p class="indent">We select the project with the lowest equivalent annual cost. In this case, it would be Project 1 (with an annual cost of $16.3 million versus an annual cost of $21.0 million for Project 2).</p>
<p class="indent2">The way to think about this is that the initial cash outlay is being translated into an equivalent annual payment, like an annual rental payment. When comparing two projects with different lives, the one with the lower required annual cash outflow per year is the one with the higher NPV.</p>
<p class="h1">Perpetuities</p>
<p class="noindent1">When doing valuation, we often use perpetuity formulas. In concept, valuation takes cash flows out until they end and then discounts them back to the present. In reality, the period over which we are comfortable projecting cash flows out may be far less than the period over which cash flows are expected to exist. To give an example, a firm like Apple might roll out a new product or service such as Apple Pay. The actual life of the project could be 50 years or more. However, analysts are only comfortable projecting cash flows out 5–10 years. The question then is: <i>How should we handle the valuation of years after the period over which we feel comfortable projecting?</i> A perpetuity formula is the answer. It values a set of periodic payments that last forever. The formula for the present value of equal cash flows that last forever is:</p>
<p class="eq1">PV = cash flow/<i>r</i></p>
<p class="indent2">Let us go back to our example of the bank and assume we earn $5 a year in interest forever. This is a perpetuity, and the present value of $5 a <a id="page_49"></a>year forever at a discount rate of 5 percent is $100 (or $5/0.05). Think of it this way: If we start with a deposit of $100 in the bank that will earn an interest rate of 5 percent forever and each year we take out all the interest earned, then each year the $100 grows to $105, we remove $5 and the process repeats. This means the initial $100 (the present value) generates $5 a year forever. Thus, to generate a payment of $5 a year forever, at a 5 percent interest rate, requires an initial deposit of $100 today.</p>
<p class="h1">A Perpetuity with Growth</p>
<p class="noindent1">Now suppose the periodic payment does not stay the same but instead grows over time at a constant rate <i>g</i>. The formula for the present value of cash flows with constant growth <i>g</i>, discounted at <i>r</i>, is:</p>
<p class="eq1">PV = cash flow/(<i>r</i> – <i>g</i>)</p>
<p class="indent">Consider our example of Apple Pay. Imagine Apple expects the cash flows to be $100 million the first year and then grow with inflation of 2 percent a year. Further, assume Apple’s discount rate for this project is 12 percent. This means the perpetuity value (i.e., the present value of the cash flows in perpetuity) is $1 billion (or $100 million/(12% – 2%)).</p>
<p class="indent2">Perpetuities are often used in firm valuation. They are particularly useful when calculating terminal values, a topic important to firm valuation.</p>
<p class="h1">The Bottom Line</p>
<p class="noindent">This chapter introduces a number of tools used in valuation and investment decisions. These tools are dependent on the concepts of the time value of money, compounding, and discounting. Although these tools are often consistent with each other, the superiority of NPV was demonstrated.</p>
<p class="indent">The NPV investment rule is quite simple:</p>
<p class="indent">Discount back all the cash flows at a required rate of return, and if the NPV of the cash flows is positive, make the investment (providing there are no legal, ethical, or environmental reasons not to). If it is negative, do not make it (unless there are legal, ethical or environmental reasons to).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_50"></a>Projects with a zero NPV provide a competitive rate of return equal to the required rate of return. This means the profit on the initial investment is commensurate with the risk of the investment.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, proficiency using Excel is valuable skill for computing NPV, IRR, and other financial metrics.</p>
<p class="indent1">The next chapter discusses leases and demonstrates how using the NPV technique allows financial statement users to adjust the presentation (and perception) of management’s accounting choice.</p>

<p class="fn" id="c2n3"><a href="#ic2n3"><sup>3</sup></a>The cash flows in this example are an annuity, an equal periodic payment for a set period of time.</p>

<p class="fn" id="c2n5"><a href="#ic2n5"><sup>5</sup></a>The case presented has one initial negative cash outflow followed by only positive cash inflows. Analyzing this investment opportunity by calculating NPV is the same as discounting the four-year $300,000 annuity and comparing it to the $1 million initial cost of the annuity. The regular $300,000 annuity payment is equivalent to the investment’s periodic returns or inflows, while the $1 million initial cost of the annuity is equivalent to the investment’s initial outflow. However, investments do not always act like annuities: Investments’ cash flows can change signs over time. Nonetheless, the NPV technique is robust and works in all situations. The NPV discounts all cash flows (positive and negative) over time and sums them up.</p>
<p class="fn" id="c2n6"><a href="#ic2n6"><sup>6</sup></a>Solving for <i>r</i> is done through an iterative approach. An estimated value for <i>r</i> is used (often the first cash flow over the initial investment). If the NPV is positive (negative) the <i>r</i> is increased (decreased) repeatedly until the NPV = 0. Although it may seem instantaneous using calculators or spreadsheets, it is done through iterative calculations.</p>
