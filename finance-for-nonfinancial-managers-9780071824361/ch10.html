<h2 class="h2"><strong>Get to Breakeven First!</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>J</strong></span></span>ust so we’re on the same page, here are two definitions of <em>breakeven point</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>First, for a product or service, <em>breakeven point</em> is the level of sales volume that, when reached, has effectively earned enough sales dollars to pay for all the costs of developing, producing, and delivering the product or service being sold. Put another way, it’s that point at which the seller is neither ahead nor behind on the income statement as a result of selling the product or service.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Next, for an enterprise or company as a whole, <em>breakeven point</em> is the level of sales volume of all products and services sold by the company that, when reached, has effectively earned enough sales dollars to pay for all the costs of developing, producing, and delivering the products or services being sold <em>and</em> the fixed costs of operating the business that’s producing those products or services. Notice the key difference between breakeven of a single product and breakeven for the company as a whole. While a single product can’t be expected to pay the light bill and the rent, everything the business sells must do exactly that if the business is to survive.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Notice that neither definition speaks to profit, the objective of running a for-profit business. Not yet anyway. This chapter’s discussion is about getting to the point where you’re ready to earn a profit. Put another way, you can’t make a profit until you get past breakeven. So let’s understand what breakeven is all about first.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>

<p class="image-b"><a id="page_150"></a><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Breakeven point</strong> The sales volume of a product or service at which the sales dollars earned are exactly equal to all the costs incurred to make or buy, and deliver to the customer, the product or service, resulting at that point in neither a profit nor loss to the company.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch10lev68"><strong>What Does “Breakeven Point” Really Mean?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Breakeven point is one of those terms that people toss around to make a point, often without knowing what it is. Conceptually we can understand without straining too many brain cells that it’s selling enough of something to cover its cost. Make a widget for $10 and sell it for $10 and you’ve broken even. But of course it’s not that simple, because making and selling a widget typically involves far more than just the cost to make one.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Here’s an example: A publishing company client of my firm buys the rights to an academic journal written by a learned professor in some highly technical area. Then the publisher sells subscriptions to that journal, pays the author a royalty on those sales, and keeps what’s left as profit. What is the cost of each subscription the publisher sells that needs to be recovered to reach breakeven? The paper, ink, and printing cost of the journal? Postage? Royalty paid? Yep, all those things. Oh, and then there’s the commission paid to the person who sold the subscription. And what about the front-end cost to purchase the rights in the first place? That front-end payment must be recovered as well, or any breakeven point is wrong.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>That brings up a calculation dilemma: Does that front-end cost, akin to a development investment, get thrown into the cost of the first subscription sold or the first one hundred subscriptions or the first one thousand? Or is it some period of time—one year, 5 years, 10 years? You’ll recognize this as similar to the depreciation discussion in <a href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, i.e., over what period are these costs to be recovered? When R&amp;D is involved—think biotech industry—that can dramatically alter the conclusion. Our client, incidentally, chose a 5-year window for their analysis, believing that the journal’s useful life was in the range of 10 years, and they wanted to have fully recovered their costs soon enough in the product lifecycle to have a reasonable run time of high returns to justify the commitment of their front-end investment.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="caution.jpg" alt="Image" width="80" height="104"/></p>
<p class="side-title"><strong>K<small>EEP</small> T<small>RACK</small> <small>OF</small> A<small>LL</small> <small>THE</small> C<small>OSTS</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Don’t forget the not-so-obvious costs. When calculating the breakeven point, it’s easy to remember the cost to make or buy the product you sell. But don’t forget that there are other costs you incur to get that product to the customer—R&amp;D, sales commissions, shipping costs, warranty coverage, and more. These costs must be covered before true breakeven is reached.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_151"></a>So while the cost to print a single copy of the journal may be pennies, that is by no means the total cost to be considered in reaching the journal’s breakeven point. Remember the key line in the definition that opened this chapter: that point at which the seller is neither ahead nor behind on the income statement as a result of selling the product or service.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch10lev69"><strong>Why Is This a Critical Factor in Profitability?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Far too many companies, which is to say the CEOs and owners who operate those companies, make decisions to launch a new product or service based on the belief that the product is in demand and will be well received in the marketplace. Solid thinking as far as it goes. As a general rule, you can’t sell something that nobody wants. But the corollary to that is you shouldn’t sell something you can’t sell profitably, and you can’t sell it profitably unless you can sell it for more than it costs you. OK, what does it cost you? Sounds like a no-brainer question, but it’s not, because new products are often rolled out, especially by smaller companies, without any of the analyses that we discuss here. Product launch decisions based on back-of-the-envelope cost estimates are frequently inaccurate because they are invariably too low, a detail only learned after the fact. By then pricing has been announced, orders solicited and filled, and the realization that a price increase is needed comes far too late.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The moral of this chapter: Every new product offering must have a realistic analysis—in writing—of the total cost of researching, developing, producing or buying, marketing and selling, delivering, and if appropriate, after-sale servicing of the product before the decision is made to <a id="page_152"></a>offer the product. My entrepreneur readers may object at this point, realizing that some of the best decisions are made without all the facts and more than a little intuition. No argument there. And any analysis of future expectations is inherently based on estimates, and thus inherently inaccurate. But that’s no reason to make less than your best effort to use this key decision-making tool. A good estimate, carefully thought out, is better than no estimate and is a valuable supplement to even the most prescient intuitive thinking.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch10lev70"><strong>How to Calculate Breakeven for a New Product</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Recognizing the varied considerations that might enter into the actual calculation (see the example above), let’s see how Wonder Widget might use this analysis technique in making a product launch decision for the proposed WW-Super 2000, a product filled with so much new technology that the Marketing Department can’t wait to start promoting it to the legions of loyal customers. Let’s look at the steps that would be needed—and their related cost estimates—in the Accounting Department’s analysis after gathering data from Engineering, Marketing, and Sales. See <a href="ch10.html#ch10fig1">Figure 10-1</a>.</p>
<div class="group">
<p class="fig-img"><a id="ch10fig1"></a><a id="page_153"></a><img src="f0171-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="554" height="547"/></p>
<p class="source">Note: No incremental costs for using company staff already on the payroll, however, we assume that direct labor cost is only incurred for actual production, so those costs count.</p>
<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 10-1.</strong> Breakeven analysis: the calculation</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Wonder Widget now has the information it needs. Dividing the net cost incurred by the potential selling price tells management the number of units the company needs to sell at that price to cover all its costs. Management likely assumes that the lower the selling price, the more units they’re likely to sell, provided there’s adequate demand. At the same time, the lower the selling price, the more units they <em>must</em> sell to achieve breakeven. At this point management must decide which price will succeed in selling at least the number of units needed to break even and whether the sales potential at that price will produce sufficient profit to warrant a full-scale introduction of the new product.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Note that only incremental or variable costs are considered in the calculation. We don’t include the cost of internal staff whose jobs involve the new product in some way unless they were specifically hired to support it. As an example, a food manufacturing client of our firm acquired a new product line from a major brand company. As part of the deal our client had to add two employees to the kitchen testing staff because of the additional demands of the new product line, even though they had staff already in place in that department. Thus, even though other members of the kitchen testing staff might spend time on the new product, only the new hires who specifically and exclusively worked on the new product were included in the breakeven calculation, because they were truly an incremental cost, rather than a reallocation of existing costs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>If yours is a service company rather than a manufacturer, the process and the logic are the same even though the individual elements will vary. And in both cases, when adding employees to support the new product or service, don’t forget to budget for payroll taxes. These, too, are part of the cost of adding staff.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch10lev71"><a id="page_154"></a><strong>What About the Entire Company’s Breakeven Point?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">From the definitions that opened this chapter, you know that the arithmetic is different when you’re evaluating the breakeven point for an entire company. While I believe it’s important to understand the breakeven point for all your products, or at least all the major ones, that doesn’t necessarily give you the information you need to assess the sales volumes needed to produce a profit for the overall enterprise. The reason becomes pretty clear if you look again at the calculation in <a href="ch10.html#ch10fig1">Figure 10-1</a>. You’ll see that it includes only incremental costs of the new product. No overhead, no administration, no vacation pay for the owner, etc.—none of that. Yet all of those costs need to be covered if the company is to be successful as a whole.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>How do you make that calculation? Well, it’s simpler to do now because we’re dealing with overall costs and not trying to split hairs for a single product. And it takes into account all those other costs that aren’t part of a single product evaluation. In its simplest form, then, the companywide breakeven point looks like <a href="ch10.html#ch10fig2">Figure 10-2</a> in chart form:</p>
<div class="group">
<p class="fig-img"><a id="ch10fig2"></a><img src="f0172-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="551" height="272"/></p>
<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figures 10-2.</strong> Breakeven analysis: the classic chart</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>For the sake of simplicity, we assume that all costs are either fixed or variable (see <a href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a> for a review of these terms). In reality some costs have characteristics of both—they’re largely fixed but over time can have <a id="page_155"></a>some of the attributes of variable costs. For now, for our purposes, costs are either fixed or variable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a href="ch10.html#ch10fig2">Figure 10-2</a> shows a horizontal line representing Fixed Costs, meaning those costs that are always present. The figure also shows a rising line beginning at zero that represents Sales. Every activity period starts with zero sales and rises as sales build, as our chart shows. The third line, labeled Variable Costs, represents the costs Wonder Widget incurred only because of its production of the products it sells. They are the costs to make or buy what it sells, to deliver to the customer, and to pay other costs directly related to those sales, such as sales commissions. Without sales these costs would not be incurred and, in general, their magnitude is directly related to those sales.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Notice that the Variable Cost line begins not at zero but at the top of the Fixed Costs line, because variable costs are incurred in addition to the fixed costs that were already in place. So we chart the Variable Cost line to effectively represent on the vertical scale <em>the total of fixed and variable costs</em>. Now the picture becomes clear. Where that Total Cost line crosses the Sales line is the point at which total sales have paid for the total costs of the business. That’s the business’ breakeven point, and all sales beyond that level should result in a positive bottom line. That, as they say, is a good thing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>One valuable use of the companywide analysis is in helping determine if a company can operate profitably as currently configured, a critical piece of information if you’re the CEO or a turnaround consultant to a troubled company. If the breakeven point is too far into the upper right corner of the chart, the first question to ask is: How can fixed costs be lowered? The second question, which usually takes more study, is: How can variable costs be lowered, or sales volume or pricing increased?</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch10lev72"><strong>What to Do If You Don’t Like the Answer</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">While a breakeven analysis in advance of a product decision is an excellent management practice, there’s no guarantee that you’ll like the answer or that the estimates will prove accurate or that the marketplace will buy all the products you need to sell at the price you want to sell them. Sometimes this analysis will tell you the whole thing isn’t going to <a id="page_156"></a>work. Either you have to sell your product for much more than the competing product or you have to sell more units than the marketplace can absorb. At that point smart managers will stop and reevaluate their options. Those options are basically three:</p>
<p class="num-list-t"><span class="none">  </span>1. Disbelieve the whole analysis and proceed on the basis that your intuition is more accurate (not recommended).</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>2. Scrap the whole idea and look for a better product, or sell more of what you’ve already got.</p>
<p class="num-list-b"><span class="none">  </span>3. Modify the product plans in ways that will also modify the analysis in a positive way; for example, add features that will increase the market appeal—and the resulting unit volume or selling price, or both—by more than the added features will cost.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The key take-away from this discussion is that a breakeven analysis is an important risk assessment tool. It enables you to test your assumptions before you spend money, with the dual objective of getting the best possible result from any launch while avoiding wasting money on a half-baked idea.</p>

<p class="noindent">Breakeven analysis should be a requirement for any new product decision, even those that will require research and/or development. While estimates may be challenging to develop, a good estimate is better than a bad surprise after the product is in the warehouse. And if you don’t like the answer you get the first time around, don’t explain it away by arbitrarily changing your assumptions. Reevaluate the product from start to finish. If your assumptions are valid, however they may be estimated, seriously consider if this is the right product, the right time, the right market, the right pricing, and so on.</p>
