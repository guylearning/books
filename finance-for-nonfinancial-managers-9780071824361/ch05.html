<h2 class="h2"><strong>Profit versus Cash Flow: What’s the Difference—and Who Cares?</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>M</strong></span></span>any participants in the workshops my firm leads are surprised to learn that instant profits and rapid growth aren’t always cause for celebration. I tell them the story of how the Wonder Widget Company got started.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>As a start-up, Wonder Widget was launched with $100,000 in cash and the hottest product in its market, the amazing Wonder Widget. The owners had sales and profits from the first month they had a product to sell! All they had to do was make the product and ship it to waiting customers who would pay enough to give Wonder Widget handsome margins from Day 1. And so the owners leased and outfitted a factory (no cash outlay initially), leased the production equipment and furnishings (still no initial cash outlay), bought the materials, hired the workers, made the product, and shipped it. They then mailed invoices totaling $50,000 to customers in their first month of sales. Amazing!</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>They paid their bills as they came due, and collected from customers in the normal course of doing business. Their customers were sometimes a bit slow, of course, but nothing out of the ordinary—the kind of 40- to 50-day payment patterns that most companies see today. And sales continued to grow, increasing by $50,000 every month, with no decline in margins and no serious competition. Profits climbed without a pause. The owners didn’t have to worry about expanding their product line <a id="page_68"></a>because everyone continued to want the product. So Wonder Widget just produced and shipped those widgets as fast as they could. This was a business your mother would love!</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Yet a strange thing happened on the way to the bank. The owners were suddenly shocked to find they didn’t have enough cash to pay their bills. They soon found they couldn’t buy more materials to make more widgets. Then they couldn’t make payroll. Finally creditors went to court and nearly had the company closed down. Instantly profitable Wonder Widget was insolvent six months after its doors opened!</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>I hope you’re asking ”How could that happen?” Good question. Let’s try to answer.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>To do that, we need to look at how cash typically flows through a company. As usual, Wonder Widget is our example.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev36"><strong>The Cash Flow Cycle</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">At the beginning of the cash cycle, nearly every business starts with—you guessed it—cash. But from that point on, the central purpose of the business is to convert that cash into other kinds of assets, to leverage or extend it with liabilities, and to ultimately turn it back into cash, but more cash than the business started with. This process continues indefinitely and simultaneously throughout the existence of a business.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In the final analysis, when a company closes its doors, the only real financial measure of its success is the difference between the amount of cash it started with and the amount it ended with, after considering cash distributed to its owners over the life of the business. However, during the life of a company we can’t very well judge how much cash it would produce if it were closed and liquidated, so we measure success in terms of how it succeeds in conducting activities that ultimately produce cash, usually measured in terms of profits and other financial factors included in the monthly reports we discussed in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="ch04.html#ch04">4</a>.</p>

<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Cash cycle</strong> In general, the time between cash disbursement and cash collection. In manufacturing, this cycle consists of converting cash into raw materials, raw materials into finished goods, finished goods into receivables, and receivables back into cash. Also known as <em>cash flow cycle,</em> c<em>ash conversion cycle,</em> and <em>operating cycle</em>.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_69"></a>Let’s look at this cycle as it applies to Wonder Widget by referring to the diagram in <a href="ch05.html#ch05fig1">Figure 5-1</a>, in which activities are moving clockwise in an endless process as the business operates.</p>
<div class="group">
<p class="fig-img"><a id="ch05fig1"></a><img src="f0087-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="510" height="337"/></p>
<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 5-1.</strong> Cash flow cycle</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>When Wonder Widget started up, its first activities revolved around setup—renting facilities, installing phones and utilities, and the like. Most of this required the outlay of cash for rent deposits, phone service, utility deposits, and other, related costs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Closely aligned with setup, and often simultaneous, was the purchase of assets to commence business operations. These included office equipment and computers for administrative purposes and factory equipment to manufacture widgets. For distributors, wholesalers, or retailers, those costs would include equipping warehouse space to stock the merchandise that they will buy and resell.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The most important asset for any business is people, of course, and Wonder Widget was probably hiring staff all along the way toward the start of production—to answer phones, to run the office, and to produce and sell their product. Of course, this can get expensive. If the owners had lots of cash, they might have paid for all these things by writing a check, <a id="page_70"></a>using money from investors or cash they themselves invested in the beginning. Usually, however, prudent owners go to their bank or a finance company to get an extended period of time to pay for their larger purchases, such as machinery, furniture, and buildings.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>That is where the company takes the next step in the cycle: obtaining credit. The main purpose of credit in a growing business is to enable the owners to increase the amount of capital they have working for them by using creditors’ capital in addition to their own. This is called leverage, putting more capital to work for the business, as discussed in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>

<p class="side-title"><strong>T<small>HERE</small>’<small>S</small> P<small>ROFIT IN</small> B<small>ORROWING</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Borrowing money enables you to increase the capital that you can put to work for you. For example, if you have $1,000 that you can invest and earn 10 percent, you’ll make $100 a year in profit. However, if you can borrow $4,000 more from a bank at 5 percent interest, you can now put $5,000 to work earning 10 percent, which will produce $500 a year. Your net profit, after paying $200 in interest to your lender, will be $300, much more than the $100 you’d have earned if you’d invested only your $1,000. You’ve leveraged your $1,000 and tripled its productivity. You’ll read more about leverage in <a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="ch13.html#ch13">13</a>.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In any event, cash is still going out at this point, even though the company’s use of credit may allow some delay in payouts. We know the Wonder Widget owners used credit to leverage their cash because unhappy creditors later took them to court.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Wonder Widget was now ready to begin production, manufacturing widgets. It began by using its inventories of materials, adding the labor of the workers and a host of other costs needed to complete the widgets. This process consumed even more cash—for workers’ wages and related taxes, materials to replace those consumed in production, sales and marketing efforts to find customers for their products, delivery of products to customers, billing, administration, accounting, and so on. This is typically the period of greatest cash consumption: when a company is in full production but no cash is coming in yet. The company hasn’t sold anything, or it has sold products but on credit, so the customers haven’t yet paid. At the same time, production and all the related business activities mentioned above must continue.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_71"></a>Continuing with the remaining steps in the cash flow cycle: After investing all that cash, the company finally sells something and begins the process of recovering that cash it’s been investing. In the sales part of the cycle, it succeeds in selling products (on credit, of course) and sends out invoices that say “Net 30” on them. That means the customers will pay them 30 days after the date on the invoice, right? Not likely.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>While collection may seem like a minor activity compared with production or sales, it’s the critical step that makes all the rest pay off. Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese Restaurants, has told his employees and countless audiences of would-be entrepreneurs that “a sale is a gift to the customer until the money is in the bank.” So the final step in the cycle is the one that turns the entire effort back into cash. At that point some key answers surface: Did the company make a profit on its business activities? Did the company plan adequately for the working capital it needs to finance the cash flow cycle in its entirety? As we’ve seen in the Wonder Widget example, one “yes” out of two isn’t good enough.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s stop for a moment and consider the situation. The owners of Wonder Widget had a hit on their hands in terms of demand. There were lots of people eager to buy their widgets, and the company probably pushed productivity to the limit to meet as much of that demand as possible. So they ordered lots of materials, hired lots of workers, shipped lots of product, and then waited for lots of customers to pay them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_72"></a>The owners had to invest their cash up front to establish the company, make the widgets, ship the product, and invoice the customers. Meantime, since a new company often doesn’t get much slack from its vendors, they probably had to pay their bills on time, often earlier than if they’d been in business for a while. And of course, if their customers thought that start-up Wonder Widget was glad for the business and would be patient about bill payment, some buyers may have delayed slightly in paying their invoices.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>None of these activities by themselves would have rendered the company insolvent, yet together they did exactly that, because they all added up to critically delay the cash flow. Wonder Widget’s situation might have looked much like <a href="ch05.html#ch05fig2">Figure 5-2</a>, with the available cash unable to sustain all the demands of growing the business.</p>

<p class="noindent">Fast-growing companies need more working capital than those growing more slowly or not at all. When incoming cash flow is delayed while fixed costs continue and paydays come every week, there’s a limit to how long a company can operate comfortably, even if it is profitable. Remember the strong demand Wonder Widget was experiencing? Every month its sales grew from the month before, which meant that to fill larger orders from customers, they had to obtain more materials than they’d had to get a month earlier. Thus, the cost of production grew even before their customers began to pay. This kind of success can rapidly accelerate the cash squeeze on a company that’s undercapitalized.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Managers in fast-growing businesses should follow these three rules:</p>
<p class="num-list-t"><span class="none">  </span>1. Look for every opportunity to stretch your cash, especially for large purchases.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>2. Forecast your cash needs as far into the future as you can reasonably see.</p>
<p class="num-list-b"><span class="none">  </span>3. Arrange for additional sources of cash well before you need it.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indentb"><span class="none">  </span>Now, you may look at Wonder Widget and say that the owners could have done something to help themselves despite their failure to use some key management tools. For example:</p>
<p class="list-box-1a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The owners could have raised prices to produce more profit sooner. That would have helped eventually, but perhaps not in time. In fact, the company was profitable from the start. The problem wasn’t in making a profit, but in converting that profit into cash.</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_73"></a><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  They could have gotten accounts receivable financing to help them get cash out of their receivables sooner. This might have also helped and perhaps it would be part of the ultimate solution. But history shows that most lenders are unwilling to lend to new companies until they’ve proven able to conduct business reliably, so that customers are less likely to raise complaints that would prevent prompt collection of the accounts that serve as the loan collateral.</p>
<p class="list-box-2a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  They could have raised more capital for their business from friends, family, or outside investors. We don’t know if they tried this and were unsuccessful because their urgent need made potential investors wary. We do know that, although they ultimately survived, they didn’t raise money in time to prevent the cash flow crisis.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="none">  </span>But that’s not the point of the story. Wonder Widget’s owners had made serious management errors, in spite of having a great product, seemingly endless demand, and super profit margins. And those errors could have cost them their company. First, they didn’t forecast their expected cash flow needs during their critical early months, a subject discussed in some depth in <a href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</a>. Second, they didn’t recognize the need to track cash flow results separately from profits. They looked at the income statement each month, saw that their efforts had produced a profit, and happily moved on.</p>

<p class="side-title"><strong>B<small>USINESS</small> G<small>OES WITH THE</small> F<small>LOW</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">The strength of a business depends on a healthy cash flow. More businesses fail due to the lack of cash than the lack of profits. Cash flow is not the same as profits; it’s all a question of timing. It’s essential, then, that cash flow be properly understood and managed as carefully as revenue, expenses, and profits.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Dave Berkus, a highly regarded (and highly successful) Southern California serial entrepreneur, investor, and author, has said:</p>
<p class="indent-a"><span class="none">       </span>Business plans that I see often show three to five years of projections, demonstrating profitability at the end of so many months of operation. Most every one of these uses an accrual basis for determining breakeven, never attempting to predict the cash impact of capital investment, slow collection times, large deposits upon leases, and other major items that consume cash.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_74"></a>If cash flow is so important, then why doesn’t it show up somewhere in the books? And how can we make it easier to see and understand? Well, it does show up in the books, since every transaction involving cash is recorded somewhere. The challenge comes in putting it into an understandable format. (We discuss the Statement of Cash Flow in <a href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>.)</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev37"><strong>Cash Basis versus Accrual Basis</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Financial reports can look different, depending on the accounting method used to keep the books. There are two basic choices of accounting method, as discussed briefly in <a href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>—cash and accrual.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Some small businesses keep their books on the cash basis because it’s simpler to understand—sort of like running the business out of your checkbook—and because it often coincides with the way they file their tax returns. As long as the owners don’t care about the strict definition of profits, that works. An example might be a consultant who sells her time to clients. She’s not very concerned about gross margins because her operating costs are relatively low. But she’s very concerned about cash flow, because without it there’s no paycheck for her.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>On the other hand, most small businesses (and all large ones) keep their books on the accrual basis, usually for one or more of three reasons:</p>
<p class="num-list-t"><span class="none">  </span>1. They’re concerned about the profit margin on products they sell.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>2. They want to know when they’re making money and when they’re not.</p>
<p class="num-list-b"><span class="none">  </span>3. They’re required by lenders, investors, or government authorities to report their activities in that way.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>These are all good reasons to use accrual basis accounting, and most experts recommend that choice. But many of these same companies look only at their income statements, but don’t prepare cash flow reports. Instead, they rely on good old rule-of-thumb methods to manage the cash so that they don’t run short or let unused cash sit idle.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Our purpose here is not to tell you which accounting method is best for you—although, like most professional advisors, we prefer accrual accounting because it gives most business owners so much useful information. Rather, we want to help you understand the differences between <a id="page_75"></a>accounting methods, so you can make the better choice. Some software packages, such as QuickBooks by Intuit, enable you to easily print reports using both the accrual and cash bases. Regardless of which method you use, keep in mind the importance of looking at the other method in some fashion so you can benefit from the management information that’s available to you.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s take a closer look at some of the data that Wonder Widget management overlooked. In the process, you might see how your own company’s management team might use its financial reports more effectively. For the sake of clarity, we assume your records are kept on the accrual basis of accounting, reflecting transactions when they happen, as discussed in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="ch04.html#ch04">4</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev38"><strong>Net Profit versus Cash Flow in Your Financial Reports</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">How does bottom-line profit differ from cash flow, exactly? Or, more specifically, how do individual transactions affect your company’s reported profits and cash flow differently? Anyone who has compared income statements and bank statements knows that profit never makes its way to the bank account in exactly the same amount that appears on the income statement. That difference is primarily the result of four kinds of transactions:</p>
<p class="num-list-t"><span class="none">  </span>1. Transactions that increase profits but don’t produce cash until later;</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>2. Transactions that decrease profits but don’t reduce cash until later;</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>3. Transactions that put cash in the bank first but don’t help your profits until later—if at all; and</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>4. Transactions that take cash but may or may not affect profits later.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s look at each of these in turn.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Type 1. Transactions That Increase Profits But Don’t Produce Cash Until Later</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">This is perhaps the largest and most obvious example of the difference we’re talking about—and the most significant item in this group is accounts receivable. Consider this example.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>If your business is a retail store, you typically sell something and get paid in cash. (For the moment we ignore the delays that come from credit card sales.) The result is an increase in sales and a corresponding increase <a id="page_76"></a>in cash in the drawer. But if you’re a supplier to that retailer—the wholesaler—you typically wait anywhere from 30–120 days or more to get paid, depending on the industry and time of year. You still record a sale when you ship your merchandise, but you don’t receive payment at the same time. You issue an invoice with the payment terms of the sale, typically 30 days or longer. The retailer records the invoice into accounts payable when the merchandise is received and pays it weeks or months later, ideally in accordance with your terms. In the interim, you must acknowledge that although you have a sale and a resulting profit, you have no money to back it up. You must plan to have enough cash on hand or instantly available to pay operating expenses between the time you ship the merchandise and the time your customer pays the invoice, often including the cost of the merchandise itself.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>For companies that sell on credit, waiting for customers to pay their bills is the largest single factor necessitating extra cash availability.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Type 2. Transactions That Decrease Profits But Don’t Reduce Cash Until Later</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The other side of the coin is the situation that produces an expense or profit reduction first and a cash disbursement later. The most obvious example is accounts payable, liabilities that you incur when you purchase consumable supplies and services. The supplies and services are typically charged to expense (profits) when purchased, although the supplier’s bill might not be paid until the following month.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s take our Wonder Widget example. The owners might have gained some cash flow advantage from purchasing their raw materials on credit, as most businesses do. In fact, given the demand for their products, they might have even put some of those raw materials into production before they had to pay for them. If they did, they could potentially have shipped finished goods to customers before they had even paid their suppliers for the raw materials that went into the widgets. They would have recorded as expenses the costs of those goods, commonly called cost of goods sold, even though they had not yet written a check to pay for the materials. This would have postponed paying, but not delayed recording costs on their income statement. Thus, costs would appear on their income statement even though no cash had left their bank account.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_77"></a><strong>Type 3. Transactions That Put Cash in the Bank But Don’t Help Your Profits Until Later—If at All</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Cash flow means everything that affects your bank balance. That includes sources of cash that might never impact profits. Consider the effect of going to the bank to borrow money. You get the loan, deposit the money in your bank account, and thus, experience positive cash flow. Yet there is no change in your profits as a result of the loan—aside from the good things you might do with the money later that will improve profits. But you don’t get to keep the money forever; sooner or later you must repay it. (We discuss this in the next section.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Closely related, particularly for new companies, is the effect of having outsiders invest in their company. The investors write a check, then the company deposits the check and issues stock to its new investors. The company can use that money, but it never appears on the income statement. Wonder Widget started operations with money like that, and it was recorded directly on the balance sheet as capital stock, not in the income statement as sale of stock.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Type 4. Transactions That Take Cash But May or May Not Affect Profits Later</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Do you remember the loan that put cash in the bank without recording a profit increase? A loan repayment is the flip side—money is paid out but there’s no reduction in profits. Of course, while you have the loan outstanding, you have to pay interest on it, which is recorded as interest expense on your income statement. But the principal reduction portion of your payment is simply returning the money to the bank, a transaction that affects both sides of your balance sheet but not your income statement.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Another example of a cash payment with a delayed impact on profit is the purchase of assets for a business—machinery, automobiles, etc.—that typically benefit the company for a number of years. A manufacturing company might pay cash for equipment that might last 5–10 years or more. Because the assets are purchased to benefit the business for years to come, accounting standards require that the cost of those assets be charged to income over the periods that receive the benefit, not the month in which the assets were purchased and paid for.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_78"></a>Of course, a manufacturer might choose to finance its purchases through installment contracts or leases and, thus, bring its cash payments and the periods benefited into closer alignment. It might finance a machine over five years and depreciate it over the same five years. This is helpful for many assets, but doesn’t solve the problem entirely because financing periods often are shorter than the useful lives of the assets being financed. For example, a factory machine might last 7–10 years or more, yet few banks will finance such purchases for longer than 3–5 years. Thus, even in this seemingly ideal scenario, you still have a disparity between the cash disbursement and recording the depreciation expense.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Another example is prepaid expenses (discussed in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>), which are amortized, for instance, an insurance policy on which an annual premium is paid in advance. When you buy the insurance and pay the premium, that policy provides protection for a year. Proper accounting treatment says the premium benefits all 12 months and, therefore, should be charged to profits over the benefit period, not only to the month in which you paid the premium. So you write your check in January, but you record as expense only 1/12 of the check amount each month over the next 12 months, the period of coverage. Cash flow and expense are reflected totally differently in this example.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>As you can see, some of these examples describe transactions in which the cash flow never affects profits, but most are cases where the expense and the cash flow happen at different times. Business managers often overlook these timing differences because they “know” the effects will pretty much equal each other over time. But they forget how significant such differences can be in the short term, when cash flow planning can be the most critical.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev39"><strong>Manager’s Checklist for <a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a></strong></h3>
<p class="check-i-1"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> The cash flowing through every company is an endless process that converts cash to operating assets and expenditures and, ultimately, back to cash. The secret is to manage the process so there’s more cash at the end than at the beginning. The management challenge is to know how well you’re succeeding at that when a company is operating <a id="page_79"></a>normally, with many cash cycles occurring simultaneously to create a net cash flow.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Net cash flow is never the same as net profit; managers must track both to be well informed about their company’s financial condition. The best way to do that is to prepare monthly financial reports that show both measures—cash flow and net profit.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Managers in fast-growing companies always need more working capital to support growth. They should consider every opportunity to conserve cash for future growth by such means as financing large purchases and arranging backup lines of credit before they’re needed.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Businesses routinely take on obligations that require large amounts of cash, such as building inventories and extending credit to customers. Much of that investment is a necessary cost of doing business; however, keep in mind that every dollar invested in inventory and accounts receivable is at risk of loss until it again becomes cash.</p>
