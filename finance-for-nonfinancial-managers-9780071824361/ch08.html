<h2 class="h2"><strong>Cost Accounting: A Really Short Course in Manufacturing Productivity</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>“C</strong></span></span>ost accounting” sounds redundant, doesn’t it? After all, isn’t all accounting about cost? Well, yes and no. To folks in the business of accounting and those most familiar with accounting practices, <em>cost accounting</em> is a special branch of the field that deals exclusively with the cost of making or buying a product or service that the company then sells to its customers. Costs that are the purview of the cost accounting specialists (known affectionately as cost accountants) are all the costs on the income statement between the Revenue line and the Gross Profit line, referred to in <a href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a> as Cost of Sales.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>While this area is considerably more complex in a company that conducts manufacturing operations, every company—manufacturing, distribution, retail, or service—needs to understand and manage its gross profit. Remember: <em>Gross profit</em> pays for all the operating costs of running the company, as well as providing a net profit to the owners. If gross profit isn’t managed well, it’s difficult for other areas of the company to make up the difference. Underlying the whole idea of cost accounting is the need of every business to protect and grow its gross profit, while maintaining the quality of its product or service at acceptable levels.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>This chapter explains some of the unique attributes of cost of sales and the efforts that go into understanding and controlling them. You’ll notice as you read this chapter that we talk primarily about manufacturing companies, because those are businesses for which cost accounting is most challenging, yet most valuable. If you work for or run a distribution company, a retailer, or a service business, some of the tools and terms we discuss here may seem less important to you. Keep in mind that the principles are universal for every business enterprise.</p>

<p class="noindent">Don’t let the seeming complexity of this topic deter you—in principle, it’s really common sense. The concepts are not complicated; it’s just the application that can be confusing if you’re applying them to a many-faceted manufacturing operation. I suggest you apply the examples here to your own company, your own employer, or your own department. I think you’ll find they make more sense when you relate them to a company you already know well.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev53"><strong>The Purpose of Cost Accounting—Strictly for Insiders</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Amazing as it may seem, many companies don’t know whether they’re making a gross profit on many of the products they sell. But it’s a simple matter for a company with even the most fundamental bookkeeping to determine if it’s making a gross profit over all of its product sales. But if a company makes a number of products, each with different cost structures and levels of complexity, the managers often don’t know how much each product contributes to—or subtracts from—the overall gross profit. And as you’ll see, that can be dangerous.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Cost accounting is the classic example of what a company’s outside observers don’t want to or need to see. Cost accounting is a detailed, often time-consuming process of counting small amounts of money, materials, and labor. Yet these small elements of cost, when multiplied by the number of units a company makes and sells over a month or a year, become the foundation for the profit that outsiders <em>are</em> anxious to see from <a id="page_121"></a>companies they follow. <em>Cost accounting,</em> then, is the ultimate example of internal management reporting: It’s information presented in a form designed for managers to use in running the company, and frankly, it’s not user friendly to those unfamiliar with the company or the business.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Are You Making a Profit or Just Building Sales Volume?</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">You may know the adage “We’re losing money on every piece, but we’re making it up on volume!” That clever shtick makes everyone laugh, but it’s not so funny in many of today’s companies, particularly those that don’t have a strong cost accounting analysis function. Among the most difficult areas of finance to manage is accounting for all the variety and complexity of costs that go into manufacturing a product. One reason is that information about cost of sales requires additional levels of data collection, some of it from company employees most removed from the financial recordkeeping function: the factory worker. It’s on the shop floor that costs are incurred, fabrication decisions are made, and hours are spent productively or wastefully—and it’s the factory worker who ultimately determines if the company has a comfortable gross profit or none at all.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Profit Management Begins with a Timecard and a Bill of Materials</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Key to gross profit management, then, is collecting the right information at the right level of detail. One of the most challenging aspects of this is capturing the time that workers spend on each job or part that they work on—job costing or process costing.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Job costing</strong> Collecting costs for a manufacturing process that’s geared to producing products in individual lots, or jobs, and assigning costs to those jobs. Jobs may be customized to the customer’s requirements, as in a machine shop, or small lots of products for selling later from stock.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Process costing</strong> Collecting all costs incurred in a continuous process or processing department, then averaging these costs over all units produced in that department. This is a mass production kind of operation, such as might be used in making chemicals, gasoline, or textiles. It’s different because the nature of the product is different. Instead of specifically identified production lots, there’s a continuous flow; the final output is complete only when the process is stopped, rather than when the order for X units is filled.</p>

<p class="noindent">Wonder Widget makes two home products, each with identical unit sales. The WW-1000 sells for $425; the custom-made WW-Super 1000 sells for $575. The combined sales of $1 million produces a gross profit of $250,000 each month, or 25 percent. But the company doesn’t know how much each unit costs. They just know that the WW-Super 1000 sells better and because it’s more difficult to make, they’re charging more for it. They believe the resulting gross profit shows that their strategy is sound. But at the urging of their bank, they engage a consultant to analyze the data and validate their assumption.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The financial consultant divides all their costs of sales into two buckets, including the added labor it takes to make the luxury model.</p>

<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Convincing workers to accurately measure time on a job and the raw materials they use—tasks that are not often to their liking and not always in the skill sets for which they were hired.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_123"></a><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Convincing workers that the purpose of the detailed timekeeping is to cost out the products, not to keep track of how much downtime they have on the job.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Convincing supervisors that the time their workers spend reporting time and materials data instead of working on another job is productive.</p>

<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  A bill of materials that enables the company to identify the materials required to manufacture a particular unit.</p>

<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The job cost sheet, either paper or electronic, that follows a job through the factory and on which actual production costs are recorded as they are incurred.

<p class="image-r"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Bill of materials</strong> A list of all the parts and components that go into manufacturing a product, including how many of each item of raw material. This document is the basis for purchasing and assembling the parts and subassemblies needed to produce a given quantity of finished products.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_124"></a>Individual companies may have their own versions of these tools, but the objective is the same: to accumulate, on the one hand, the labor and materials that are intended to be consumed to complete the job and, on the other hand, the labor and materials that were actually consumed to complete the job. The differences are later analyzed to help managers understand why the actual costs incurred differed from the expected costs. (See “Manufacturing Cost Variances” later in this chapter for more insight into this kind of analysis.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><em>Process costing</em> is simpler than job costing, due to the <em>continuous</em> nature of the manufacturing process. The Accounting Department collects all the costs incurred by a particular manufacturing department for each manufacturing process carried out in that department and groups the costs into essentially two categories: direct materials and conversion cost.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Direct materials</strong> The raw materials that go directly into making a product. The direct materials to manufacture a chair, for example, would include wood, fabric, screws, and glue. (For ease of accounting, some minor costs may not be assigned directly, but rather may be grouped into manufacturing overhead and allocated to all production rather than specific jobs or parts.)</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><em>Conversion cost</em> is the sum of all the direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs that belong to that department and that process. Dividing the total costs charged to that manufacturing department by the total number of units the department’s efforts produced gives us the unit cost of all units produced during the period being measured. The final unit cost is equivalent to the unit cost arrived at in a <em>job costing</em> environment. The difference is that a continuous process does not permit the individual collection of costs by unit during the process, a factor that could limit the analysis potential later on.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev54"><strong>Fixed and Variable Expenses in the Factory</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In any department of every company, including the manufacturer’s shop floor, there are costs that don’t change from day to day and there are costs that change constantly, depending on the company’s level of activity. Understanding costs that do and don’t change is important to the manager’s ability to manage the costs for which he or she is responsible.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Costs that essentially remain unchanged even though the business increases its volume of sales are called <em>fixed costs</em>. Such costs may be more easily predicted and managed because they rarely change. An example is the rent on a building occupied under a long-term lease. For the most part, that monthly lease payment remains unchanged for the life of the lease, predefined increases aside. Another example is depreciation expense on an asset, which remains constant until the asset is removed from service, assuming it lasts as long as intended.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><a id="page_125"></a><img src="keyterms.jpg" alt="Image" width="96" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Conversion cost</strong> The sum of all the direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs that belong to that department and that process.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Direct labor</strong> The cost of wages paid to workers directly employed in manufacturing products or in providing the services for customers. On the shop floor, it’s the labor of the machinist or the welder. In a consulting firm, it’s the time of the consultant who’s working with the client. In a distribution company, there may be little or no direct labor, as products are generally purchased in finished form, which is to say, the direct labor was incurred by the original manufacturer and included in the purchase price paid by the distribution company.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Manufacturing overhead</strong> All the costs necessary to operate the business not classified as direct labor or direct materials. Often referred to as <em>indirect costs,</em> these may include rent, insurance, utilities, janitorial service, and the supervisors who oversee the direct labor workers but who do not work on jobs directly themselves. All these indirect costs are necessary for the manufacturing process, but they are not charged directly to specific jobs. Instead, they’re grouped and then allocated to all the jobs or products in some manageable way. <em>Allocation</em> is most often based on a factor directly related to the work produced, such as direct labor hours worked on the job or direct labor dollars charged to the job.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Costs that increase in direct relation to sales volume are called <em>variable costs</em>. For example, a 10 percent increase in sales results in a 10 percent increase in variable costs. You can see that direct materials and direct labor would be variable—the more units you make, the more of those costs you would incur. Packaging materials used in shipping the finished goods would also vary with production levels.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Costs that increase in relation to sales but at a slower pace, for example, 5 percent for each 10 percent increase in sales, are said to be <em>semifixed costs,</em> meaning they have aspects of both variable and fixed costs. For example, a manufacturing scrap pickup service might accept larger amounts of scrap without raising its pickup prices until it needs to send a larger truck and two operators. Then it might increase the price and keep it fixed until the larger truck can no longer haul more scrap away. The cost over time becomes semi-fixed as sales, and therefore manufacturing scrap, increase.</p>

<p class="image-b"><a id="page_126"></a><img src="keyterms.jpg" alt="Image" width="96" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Fixed costs</strong> Those costs that essentially remain unchanged even though the business increases its sales volume.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Variable costs</strong> Those costs that increase in direct relation to sales volume.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Semi-fixed costs</strong> Those costs that increase in relation to sales but at a slower pace. Semi-fixed costs have aspects of both variable and fixed costs.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In the interest of avoiding unnecessary complexity, we ignore the semi-fixed attributes of costs and, instead, label every cost element as either fixed or variable because we’re trying to understand how costs behave in certain circumstances. For example:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  If variable costs increase faster than sales, there’s inefficiency in the process that management needs to identify and correct, because variable costs should never grow faster than sales under normal conditions.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  If costs identified as fixed rise unexpectedly, it’s good to know this shouldn’t be caused by a change in sales volume, and the cause should therefore be investigated.</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  If costs identified as variable are not moving up or down proportionately with sales, the cause should be investigated, because there may be unrecorded expenses that distort reporting in the month being reviewed (costs too low) and in the month when they finally get recorded (costs too high).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Knowing these characteristics enables us to budget more accurately, particularly if we’re planning for the possibility of different levels of sales and we must be prepared for several possibilities. (See <a href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</a> for a discussion of flexible budgets.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>It’s wise to keep this simple principle in mind: <em>All costs are fixed in the short term and all costs are variable in the long term.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In other words, regardless of the label you put on it, any cost can be reduced by effective management, given sufficient time. In the case of a company’s building lease payments, “sufficient time” may mean at the expiration of the lease. Most costs can be modified in a much shorter timeframe, even those we call fixed.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><a id="page_127"></a><img src="mistakeproofing.jpg" alt="Image" width="126" height="91"/></p>
<p class="side-title"><strong>D<small>ON’T</small> G<small>ET</small> S<small>TUCK ON</small> L<small>ABELS</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">An effective manager thinks outside the categories of fixed costs and variable costs. Don’t assume that you can’t reduce fixed costs, or that variable costs are easy to reduce. Sometimes it’s possible to reduce costs by converting fixed costs to variable costs by outsourcing services or renting equipment only as needed. Or you may try to reduce the time it takes to assemble a unit, only to find that you’re spending more time inspecting and correcting.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>By contrast, even the most variable of costs, such as the labor that goes directly into making a product that will be sold immediately (like the amazing Wonder Widget), cannot be changed instantly. Labor reductions—often the result of technological advances—typically require giving employees reasonable notice, providing termination pay, overcoming resistance to losing skilled workers, and other factors that effectively stretch out the time it takes to reduce the net cost to the company.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>So, the terms fixed costs and variable costs are not entirely accurate. However, financial managers and the users of their information, as well as production planners and managers, adopted the terms to create a framework for approximating how these costs are likely to act. Why? To enable them to predict future cost relationships and thereby manage the bottom-line outcomes of management actions at various sales volumes. As with so many management decisions, this often becomes a choice between greater accuracy at higher cost and lesser (but still acceptable) accuracy at lower cost.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev55"><strong>Controllable and Uncontrollable Expenses</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at costs from another angle: our ability to control their movement up and down.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Costs that responsible managers can readily control are called, logically enough, <em>controllable costs</em>. Some examples are travel expenses, non-production labor costs, most marketing expenses, office supplies, and long-distance telephone charges. Notice I didn’t say that these costs are controllable without consequences, only that they’re controllable, which <a id="page_128"></a>means a manager can make and implement a conscious decision to reduce expenditures in these areas. Even though the company may lose the benefits to be gained from incurring these costs, they’re still controllable because managers <em>can</em> lower or eliminate them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><em>Uncontrollable costs,</em> by contrast, cannot in general be controlled. Examples that readily come to mind include income taxes, depreciation, and rental or lease payments.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let me repeat what I stated earlier: <em>All costs are uncontrollable in the short term; all costs are controllable in the long term.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>This is a conceptual truth that is, by and large, useless in the Accounting Department or in budget preparation. But in concept, it’s important to realize that you’re not captive to any costs charged to your department or unit, as long as you’re prepared to manage these costs actively and as long as you can accept or ameliorate the consequences of removing those costs, which may include loss of their attendant benefits.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In a company’s Production Department, controllable costs are those for which managers are appropriately held accountable. Cost estimates should be built around the realization that some costs just are what they are, regardless of management efforts. If your department has a large drill press on its floor, you’re likely to be charged for the depreciation of that machine as long as you’re using it. You can’t control that cost if you need the drill press to do your job. But by proper preventive maintenance, you can control the repair costs and downtime of that machine—and that’s your responsibility if you’re running the department.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Stepping outside the Production Department for a moment, the concept of controllable and uncontrollable costs applies equally throughout a company’s organization structure. Lease payments on property are uncontrollable for the duration of the lease. Once the lease runs out, those costs are again controllable, until you sign another lease, after which they again become uncontrollable. Labor costs are always controllable to a degree, but not totally. You cannot run an organization without people, but you probably can run it with fewer people than it normally employs, if you’re willing to redistribute the essential work and forgo the less essential work that people do.</p>

<p class="noindent">It’s not uncommon for managers to incent their workers to achieve more with less cost. That’s called increasing productivity. But the most successful management performance reward programs recognize the distinction between the costs that employees can control and those they cannot. Avoid challenging an employee or a supervisor to meet bottom-line goals that he or she cannot really control or significantly influence.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_129"></a>Consider the possibilities. What if you were able to distinguish between the essential work and the less essential work every day? What if you could focus on minimizing the unessential and expediting the essential? Would your department be more successful? The power of financial analysis lies in its ability to help identify the financial ramifications of doing just that and to quantify the benefits in dollars and cents. It’s a wonderful tool for helping to make decisions from a place of knowledge, rather than estimating, or worse, guessing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>That’s why I wrote this book.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev56"><strong>Standard Costs—Little Things Mean a Lot</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the challenges in using financial reporting for cost accounting purposes is to determine the actual cost of a unit of finished goods that was produced during the month, in time to issue a financial statement reasonably soon after the month-end. Accounting departments are sometimes criticized for issuing financial reports too long after the accounting month is over, when the reports are of little value in managing the succeeding month (or two, in some cases). Financial statements that take several weeks or more to prepare may not be available soon enough to help managers adjust their performance in the next month. Lessons learned from January reports issued at the end of February cannot be put into use until March, meaning it’s likely that January’s mistakes were repeated in February. In a fast-moving or highly competitive or slim-margin business, that should be unacceptable to an alert management team. This is why in recent years technology advances have fostered the growth of <em>real-time accounting</em>—systems that collect accounting information continuously and provide selected management reports on demand, without the need to formally “close the books.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_130"></a>In the manufacturing environment, the short-term answer to this need has traditionally been <em>standard costing,</em> a term that means using standard costs in lieu of actual costs to account for individual manufacturing steps. Standard costing is a way to estimate the actual unit cost for purposes of prompt financial reporting, while still leaving a way to return later for more detailed analysis. Standard costing takes the budgeting process down to the components of unit cost so a company can budget direct labor and raw materials for each unit of finished goods that it plans to produce.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Standard costing</strong> A management tool that estimates the overall cost of production, assuming normal operations. Standard cost methodology enables a company to more quickly produce production reports and thus react more quickly to what those reports say and close the books more quickly at month-end. Standard costs, rather than actual costs, are used in accounting for materials, labor, and even overhead, assuming an efficient plant operating at normal capacity. The standard costs and actual costs are compared periodically to see if actual costs have gotten out of control or standard costs are no longer relevant. Unavoidable or permanent variances in price or quantity, e.g., price increases, may result in revised standard costs for those items.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev57"><strong>Manufacturing Cost Variances: Analysis for Action</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Using standard costing enables a manufacturer to budget the unit costs of production and to compare actual costs with standard costs in its financial reporting. The benefit of such reporting is not seeing whether the two agree, or even by how much they disagree. The benefit of standard costing is in analyzing those differences and using that information to enable managers to change what they’re doing and make the business optimally profitable. This process is called <em>variance analysis,</em> meaning the analysis of differences, to enable managers to see where to minimize or eliminate those variances.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Variance analysis</strong> The process of identifying, measuring, and investigating the causes of significant differences (variances) between budgeted plans and actual results. Variances can be calculated according to time, volume, cost, efficiency, or price.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>We discuss variance analysis in some detail in <a href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</a> because variance analysis is the principal tool for getting the most value from budgets in general. Variance analysis has particular application in manufacturing when standard costs are used, and so it belongs in this chapter as well.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Management by exception</strong> A management practice by which standards are set for operating activities, actual results are compared with those standards, and significant differences are brought to the attention of the managers, along with the reasons for the differences and recommended corrective action, if appropriate.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In <em>standard costing</em> there are two basic kinds of variances, or differences, from established standards: price variances and usage variances. <em>Price variances</em> occur when materials or labor used in production cost the company more or less per unit than was projected when the standards were set. <em>Usage variances</em> occur when the production run consumes more or less of the materials or labor than planned.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>For example, consider this example from Wonder Widget’s weekly manufacturing variance report (<a href="ch08.html#ch08fig2">Figure 8-2</a>).</p>
<div class="group">

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 8-2.</strong> Report of manufacturing cost variances</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_132"></a>In this example, actual labor cost per unit was $42 (1.5 hours at $28/hour). The standard per unit for this switch was $30 (1.2 hours at $25/hour). The total unfavorable variance for 1,000 units was $12,000 (($42 – $30) × 1,000 units). That information by itself is interesting, but not particularly useful. It might be difficult to give a plant supervisor that information and expect an informed plan to eliminate the variance. But let’s look at what happens when we analyze the components of the variances (<a href="ch08.html#ch08fig3">Figure 8-3</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Now we know the causes of the variances, and we know what each kind of variance is costing us. We can approach the supervisor about getting the time back to the standard of 1.2 hours per unit of labor, or finding out if the standard should be increased because more time is required to make these switches correctly. And we can approach the Human Resources manager to find out why we paid more than standard wages for our labor. For example: Did we hire overqualified people? Has the market gotten tight for workers with the skills we need? Did we do a thorough enough search for workers within our price range?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>This same analysis can be carried out for the materials variances.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Now we have a plan of action, and we know which managers we should talk to about carrying out the plan. That’s what standards can do for a manufacturing company, <em>if</em> the managers know what each unit costs and <em>if</em> they know what each should cost. Variance analysis now becomes a powerful management tool for controlling the unit cost of the switch, which contributes directly to the gross profit line on Wonder Widget’s income statement.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>And that’s a good thing.</p>

<p class="check-i-1"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Cost accounting is about protecting and growing gross profit by understanding and managing the details of the cost of sales, i.e., the costs incurred in producing revenue.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Knowing the costs and gross profit margins on each product a company sells is a critical tool for managing overall gross profit. This is true for all kinds of businesses, but it’s more challenging for a manufacturing company because of the complexity of the business.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Cost accounting is possible only when detailed production costs are collected at the source, on the shop floor.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Understanding how costs behave is key to controlling them. Tools such as standards, budgets, and classifications such as “controllable,” “variable,” and “direct” help us to do that.</p>
<p class="check-i-2"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Variance analysis is the way managers use standards and management by exception to reduce variation from predicted outcomes.<a id="page_134"></a></p>
