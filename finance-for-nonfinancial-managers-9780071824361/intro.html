<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>W</strong></span></span>hy should you buy this book? There are certainly others to choose from, each with a viewpoint that reflects the author’s background and opinions. Why this one? Why this particular author’s background and opinions? The answer is <em>financial comprehension</em>: This book is a communication manual for nonfinancial managers.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>I believe there is a great need for better communication between financial and nonfinancial professionals, a need for a better tool to help the nonfinancial manager understand the language of finance, and for the financial professional to learn the terminology that has meaning for the nonfinancial manager. I believe this book can enable that better communication. That is, in fact, its purpose.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Why me? First, I spent eight years of my early working life as a practicing CPA. I felt the frustration that comes from not speaking the same language as my clients and the difficulty in getting the information I needed from people who didn’t understand why I requested the information or what I would do with it. Then there were my 14 years as a financial officer inside several companies where I was responsible for finding a common language so I could provide business managers with what they needed to run their departments, divisions, and corporations. Since then I have spent more than 25 years as an advisor to business managers and entrepreneurs on financial matters.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Over each of those career phases, I’ve become known for my ability to translate complex or esoteric financial concepts into plain language. I <a id="page_xii"></a>understand better than most both the accountant’s and the business manager’s viewpoints. Not surprising, they often speak different languages, and the results are usually less than satisfactory for both. This book can facilitate a better understanding between them, since their common objective is the greater success of the enterprise that employs them both. This second edition, 10 years after the original edition was published, is evidence that my purpose is being achieved, at some level at least.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>There are more than a few books on bookstore shelves—including digital versions—that attempt to achieve a similar purpose. But few have demonstrated a decade-long staying power. Mine has, and to me, financial communication is a topic I believe this book deals with very effectively.</p>
<p class="indentb"><span class="none">  </span>So, what should you hope to get from this book?</p>
<p class="list-box-1a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The viewpoint of an author who speaks the language of finance, but thinks more like a line manager than an accountant;</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Examples of typical financial reports, with plenty of explanations—in comprehensible English—that will help you understand those same kinds of reports when you see them in your company;</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Examples of financial reports you may not yet have seen in your company, but that you might want to, because they could give you valuable information; and</p>
<p class="list-box-2a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Help in mastering the tools of finance where they can be useful to you, without wasting your time with explanations of the deep details that will likely never benefit you.</p>
<p class="indenttb"><span class="none">  </span>If you are now or intend to become a manager in charge of a profit center or perhaps the owner of your own business, you need a working knowledge of a lot of the information in this book. You are or may become:</p>
<p class="list-box-1a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The person your staff looks to for guidance in budgets and other financial management matters;</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The person your boss or the home office expects to consistently achieve your assigned financial targets—or even the person who sets those targets;</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The person responsible for directing the finance and accounting functions that support your unit or company; and</p>
<p class="list-box-2a"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_xiii"></a><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The person who can effectively explain to staff, boss, board of directors, and even outsiders the financial implications of the results you’ve achieved and the results you expect to deliver in the future.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="none">  </span>Regardless of your path, your career success depends on doing these things reasonably well, and you cannot do that without a respectable knowledge of finance and accounting. Notice I didn’t say a <em>thorough</em> knowledge and I didn’t say you need to understand how accountants process detailed information. I didn’t even say you had to get it right every time, because accountants don’t, either. But you do need to be comfortable talking the language of finance at the nontechnical level so that you can communicate effectively in either direction. And that’s why this book is still relevant after 10+ years.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><strong>How to Use This Book</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><a href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a> sets the stage for the book. It discusses how events in today’s business world have increased the need for financially savvy managers. Business managers and owners today must have both financial integrity and a degree of financial competence not previously expected of them. It’s no longer good enough to keep poor accounting records in the belief that the accountants will clean it up at the end of the year so the company can file correct tax returns. There’s no scanning a financial report to find the profit number for the month and ignoring the rest of the report. And it’s no longer good enough for a manager to be ignorant of financial terminology if he or she wants to climb the corporate ladder, or even be demonstrably successful in their current job. You need more.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>To those ends, allow me to introduce you to the Wonder Widget Company, a manufacturer and distributor of the most amazing line of widgets you’ll find anywhere. They’re economical to produce and sell, durable, and easy to replace when they wear out, which they are of course designed to do at some point so the company can sell more. But profit motive (and cynicism) aside, Wonder Widget has a pretty enlightened management team when it comes to sharing its financial position with its employees. The company long ago adopted a practice called Open Book Management, which means management regularly shares the company’s financial reports with the employees, so everyone in the company feels <a id="page_xiv"></a>they’re seeing the results of their efforts reflected in the company’s success. To achieve that, management takes pains to design the financial reports to be easy to read without sacrificing accuracy or usefulness. So I decided to use this company as an example of good reporting when most of the readers will be nonfinancial people. Like many of my clients. Like you.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a> through <a href="ch06.html#ch06">6</a> cover the basic financial reports you should typically see on a monthly basis, with lots of tips on reading, understanding, and using the information they contain. For that reason, as your first objective, I suggest you read, and perhaps reread, <a href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a> through <a href="ch06.html#ch06">6</a>, in order, until you feel comfortable with them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Then I suggest you proceed to <a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="ch08.html#ch08">8</a>, which delve into the “hidden information” that Wonder Widget and every company has. Each explores a specific analysis area in which basic financial information is reorganized and discussed in more depth to present that hidden information. The objective of these chapters is for you to know how to get to that information—get it into reports <em>and</em> understand what the reports are telling you.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a> focuses on Wonder Widget’s operating ratios, which are selected relational calculations based on numbers in the financial statements. The ratios show the relationship between two variables that may not be apparent from a casual reading of the statements, but that are important to assessing a company’s financial health. We discuss some of the most common and useful ratios and how you can use them to better understand the underlying strength of whatever it is they measure. This is a chapter you might return to often as a handy reference.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a> explains the essentials of cost accounting—how it works and why it’s so important in helping a company control its gross profit margins. The purpose of cost accounting is to enable managers to know the true cost of the products or services their company sells so they can choose to sell more of the profitable ones and fewer of the unprofitable ones.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapters 9</a> and <a href="ch10.html#ch10">10</a> present material not covered in the first edition. The content covers decision-making tools that every company needs when investing in growth or new products, or even when choosing <a id="page_xv"></a>between investment alternatives or enhancing existing products. Wonder Widget management performed all these activities at one time or another. They used investment return analysis to determine the best use of the company’s investment capital, and they used breakeven analysis to decide how much to invest in new product development, how to price products, and how to set goals for their sales department, all decisions that require focused financial analysis.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a href="ch11.html#ch11">Chapters 11</a> and <a href="ch12.html#ch12">12</a> explore the critical management function of planning, including operational planning and budgeting. These sections are placed near the end of the book so that you first acquire an understanding of the types of things you typically plan for—profits, cash flow, and financing the business—before you get into the planning itself. <a href="ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</a> discusses business planning—the importance of planning, the difference between strategic planning and operational planning, using vision and mission as the starting point for planning strategy, and setting long-term and short-term goals. <a href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</a> considers budgeting, that is, how to best allocate the company’s resources to achieve the goals set out in the business plan.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a href="ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</a> explains the fundamentals of financing a business—getting the capital to launch it and the working capital to operate it. This is an important area for growing businesses everywhere, because growth consumes capital, often at a pace faster than a growing business can create that capital internally. This chapter looks at both debt and equity financing, explains some of the techniques used to get the needed capital, and discusses some of the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Finally, for those of you starting your own business or hoping to, <a href="ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a> discusses some basics of attracting capital to a new venture. This is a path chosen by more and more budding entrepreneurs as they see untapped opportunities created by the digital age and by managers in large companies that experience layoffs. They come to understand what I tell the consultants I mentor: The only real job security comes from the business you build for yourself. (But that’s another story for a different book.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>It’s my hope that you’ll refer to sections of this book many times over, long after you’ve finished your “first read.” By using this book as an ongoing <a id="page_xvi"></a>reference, you’ll reinforce the book’s lessons and find new ways to use it with each reading.</p>
