<h2 class="h2"><strong>The Income Statement: The Flow of Progress</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>Y</strong></span></span>ou’ll remember we identified the Income Statement as a report that tallies the cumulative effect of all the income and expense transactions that occurred during a given period, i.e., between two balance sheet dates. Those transactions typically have the goal of producing a profit for the company. The income statement shows the company’s success in achieving that objective.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev24"><strong>They Say Timing Is Everything—And They’re Right!</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Income Statement is the report most nonfinancial managers readily recognize. They know it shows whether the business made a profit for the month, the quarter, or the year. In large companies and small ones, managers’ bonuses are often based on profit results (too often, in my opinion, because most of them typically have little control over profit—but that’s another subject). Others know it’s the report most valued by CEOs, shareholders, bankers, and government regulators. Some managers recognize its format but call it by a different name such as <em>profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement, statement of income and expenses,</em> and a few others.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Whatever you call it, it’s usually acknowledged to be the most important report a company produces. (But hold your vote until you’ve read <a href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>.) As such, it behooves us to take time to understand how it comes together and why that matters.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_53"></a>While nonfinancial people recognize the importance of the income statement, they don’t always appreciate how transaction timing affects profit in any given period. In fact, they’re often surprised that monthly reports don’t show the effects of individual transactions that they expected to see, even though nothing has been missed or reported incorrectly. There are two culprits in this plot:</p>
<p class="num-list-t"><span class="none">  </span>1. The passage of time between the date a transaction was first committed to a supplier or a customer and—through the processes of fulfillment, invoicing or billing, and recording—the date payment was made or received.</p>
<p class="num-list-b"><span class="none">  </span>2. The confusion that sometimes arises as to when a transaction should properly be recorded under the accounting rules (recall GAAP from <a href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Regarding the first culprit—time—there’s often a long sequence of events that must be completed before a transaction can be recorded. The final step of a transaction might be recorded days or even weeks after the initiating department has finished its role in the process, e.g., taking an order from a customer or ordering goods from a supplier. It might be even longer before the transaction is complete, e.g., the company collects from the customer or pays the supplier.</p>

<p class="noindent">Imagine a new Wonder Widget salesperson is selling an advanced widget, the Super Widget 2000. The salesperson does a great job of selling the product’s benefits and tells the customer the price includes full installation and training, with no commitment to pay until the widget works. So the customer places the order. The paperwork goes into Wonder Widget’s Sales Office for processing, and the salesperson enthusiastically goes on to the next deal, hoping for a commission check before sunset. Meanwhile, the process of setting up the customer begins, including credit application, credit checking, shipping instructions, etc. Then the product finally ships to the customer. Done, right? Actually, it’s just the beginning.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>This Super Widget 2000 isn’t “plug-and-play” like its predecessors; it requires installation, setup, debugging, and finally, training, all of which are part of the product package. By the time all that’s completed, months have passed. The salesperson still has that sale on an open item list—I sold it, but they haven’t paid me for it yet. The company can’t hold the customer to the sale until the installed product is accepted. Under the rules of accounting, the sale can be recorded only when the customer is irrevocably committed <em>and</em> the company has delivered on its promises. Under Wonder Widget’s commission plan, the commission is payable under the same circumstances: so, no sale, no commission.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_54"></a>As for the second culprit—confusion—I recall an incident when I was the controller of a large company with a nationwide sales organization. A regional sales manager with budget responsibilities questioned a financial report that showed expenditures charged to his department in June, when he had made the deal with the supplier to provide the merchandise or services in April. “Why wasn’t it taken out of my budget in April, when I spent the money?” he asked.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Expenses don’t get recorded when they’re committed, when the order is called in, when a purchase order is issued, or even when the supplier agrees to supply the goods or services ordered. Those events are simply requests or promises, all of which typically can be rescinded without penalty. So they’re not irrevocable transactions that we can record. When the supplier acts on that promise to deliver, then we have an accounting event to record, and that’s when the money is really spent.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Why would the sales manager even care about such accounting refinements? Well, first, he was being evaluated on his performance against budget, which is always a good tool for instilling budget consciousness. But mostly he wanted to be relieved of the need to keep track of money he had committed and (in his mind) spent. It’s easy to understand his desire, since keeping track of such details is time-consuming. If the money were charged against his budget when it was committed, he would know how much he had left to commit or spend in later months.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The questions made sense to the sales manager, yet frustrated the accountants. They could never convince him they had accounted for it correctly (especially since they sometimes hadn’t). Yet the best answer lay in better communication between the two groups about how accounting works and about when a promise becomes a commitment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In today’s digital environment, many companies have integrated enterprise accounting software that keeps track of purchase orders issued but not yet fulfilled, making it easier to track and report commitments made for future goods and services. Even so, such commitments cannot be booked as expenses until the goods have been delivered and the purchase order satisfied. This is the flip side of the sales example above, but the same accounting rules apply. With that overview in mind, let’s look at the line items on a typical income statement. As an example, let’s use the most recent income statement of the Wonder Widget Company. Take a look at <a href="ch04.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a> and then read on.</p>

<p class="noindent">A good example of conflicting objectives that can cause misunderstanding is the answer to the question: When is it sold? One of the corporate scandals reported in the press a few years ago involved equipment service contracts the company recorded as equipment sales. Why? Probably because equipment sales go into profit immediately, while service contracts can be recorded only as the service is rendered, often over months or years. A sale recorded now counts for more than a sale that will be recorded next year, especially if you’re trying to pump up earnings per share this quarter. A smart manager understands about conflicting objectives and the dangers that can result.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev25"><a id="page_56"></a><strong>Sales: Grease for the Engine</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">“Nothing happens until you sell something.” This is the sale to customers of products and services <em>that the company regularly offers for sale in the normal course of business</em>. This means we don’t include the sale of surplus equipment off the shop floor because that’s not our business. We also don’t include the sale of a building that we’re no longer using (unless our business is buying and selling buildings). It does mean, as noted above, a completed sale, an irrevocable transaction for which the customer must pay.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Depending on your business, <em>sales</em> might be called different things on your income statement. Sales of services are often called <em>revenue,</em> although the terms mean pretty much the same thing, and there are no real differences in the rules between sales of products and sales of services. We use the terms interchangeably in this book.</p>

<p class="noindentb">When the outside world looks so intently at a company’s sales for clues to its success, it’s sometimes hard for company management to resist the temptation to cut corners in the interest of pleasing current and potential shareholders. Because some of the accounting rules seem to have room for interpretation, occasionally they get interpreted all the way into the next room. Here are some examples that you will want to look out for:</p>
<p class="list-box-1a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  Recording sales too soon, before the transaction is complete, e.g., such as when the quarter is ending and the CEO wants the company to look good.</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  Recording sales too late, e.g., waiting until the next month or quarter because the CEO doesn’t expect that quarter to look as good as this one and he or she wants to even out the quarters a bit.</p>
<p class="list-box-2a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  Recording sales that haven’t really happened (yet), but that the CEO is sure will happen momentarily, and so why not slip them in a bit early.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev26"><strong>Cost of Sales: What It Takes to Earn the Sale</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Cost of Sales</em> represents all the costs of manufacturing or buying the products sold during the period, including raw materials, manufacturing labor, and related overhead costs (collectively these are called <em>Cost of Goods Sold</em>), and including the directly related selling costs, e.g., commissions, <a id="page_57"></a>which are not typically included in the calculation of cost of goods sold. <a href="ch04.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a> shows how the two terms differ in their calculation. Depending on which approach a company takes, its gross profit and gross margin percentage will be slightly different, although operating profit will be the same in either case.</p>
<div class="group">
<p class="fig-img"><a id="ch04fig2"></a><img src="f0075-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="546" height="493"/></p>
<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 4-2.</strong> Cost of Sales: How Wonder Widget calculates cost of sales</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Companies that purchase and resell goods intact (rather than manufacturing the products they sell) generally report the cost of purchased goods on this line rather than accumulating raw materials and direct labor costs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>To take this one step farther, companies that sell services rather than products usually report this line as Cost of Services rather than Cost of Sales. This subtle distinction has lost ground in recent years as some service companies have dispensed with the term altogether, opting instead to simply report Revenues, Operating Expenses, and Operating Profit.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>One element of cost that is almost always represented in cost of sales, and in operating expenses as well, is Depreciation, described briefly in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, and its close cousin, Amortization. These line items require extra comment because they don’t flow to the income statement in the same way as other costs. As noted in the discussion of the balance sheet, <em>depreciation</em> describes the gradual decline in value of a capital asset—a building, machine, truck, or table that was purchased for its value to the business over a number of years. <em>Amortization</em> applies to the decline in value of <em>intangible</em> assets with a multiyear life, such as a website, a patent, or a license to use someone else’s intellectual property.</p>

<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Depreciation</strong> The amount of expense that a company charges against earnings to write off the cost of a capital asset over the time it will benefit the company, without regard to how it was paid for and after considering age, wear, obsolescence, and salvage value.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Various methods are used to calculate this expense, most originating from favorable tax laws. If the expense is assumed to be incurred equally over the life of the asset, the method of depreciation is <em>straight line,</em> with the same amount recorded to expense in each period of the asset’s life. If the expense is assumed to be incurred in decreasing amounts over the life of the asset, the method is <em>accelerated,</em> with a larger expense recorded in the early years than in the later ones. The former method is more common; the total cost of the asset is divided by the number of months it will be used and the result is charged to expense each month until the asset is retired or sold off.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Purchasing a capital asset entails a cash expenditure but not the recording of an expense. Instead, the capital asset is placed on the balance sheet in the appropriate asset category and charged to expense gradually over its estimated useful life. Thus the expense charge for depreciation is one of the unusual items that doesn’t result from a cash expenditure in the period that the charge appears—the cash was actually spent months or years ago—and for that reason you’ll see it appear again in the discussion of cash flow (<a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="ch06.html#ch06">6</a>).</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev27"><a id="page_58"></a><strong>Gross Profit: The First Measure of Profitability</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Gross profit is a key measure of profitability, one we discuss in more depth in <a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="ch08.html#ch08">8</a>. <em>Gross Profit</em> is the gain the company earns by selling its products after accounting for all elements of the cost of sales. Earning a gross profit is important, because the difference between sales and the cost of sales normally pays all the operating expenses discussed next. In other words, if you sell each widget at a loss, it’s highly unlikely you’ll make up the loss through volume.</p>

<p class="noindent">While the traditional income statement that shows cost of sales and gross profit is most commonly seen in financial reports, there is great value in presenting Contribution Profit instead of gross profit, or as an additional P&amp;L view. In this approach all direct costs are deducted from sales first, because they are costs directly incurred as a result of sales—costs that would not have occurred but for the sales. The result of deducting direct costs from sales is called <em>Contribution Profit,</em> meaning the profit directly contributed by those sales. Indirect costs and overhead are presented later on the income statement, indicating they would have occurred even if the sales had not occurred. Net income is the same in either case, of course. The greatest value of contribution profit comes in presenting it for individual product lines, thus showing the specific contribution to the bottom line that was produced by each product line.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev28"><strong>Operating Expenses: Running the Business</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Operating Expenses</em> includes all the business’ operating costs—what it takes to keep the doors open and to support the sales of the company’s products or services. Usually subcategories appear on the income statement, as we’ve done in <a href="ch04.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>, to show the operating expenses incurred to carry on each of the company’s major functional activities. These are typically engineering or R&amp;D (research and development), sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>There can be other categories of costs, depending on the nature of the company’s business. For example, a drug company might carry separate categories for research and for product development because these are such significant cost areas for a company in that business. A distribution company <a id="page_59"></a>that buys and sells products made by others would have no reason to have R&amp;D costs, but might have a category called Distribution Expenses, because that’s a significant area of expense for a distribution company.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s look briefly at what each of these expense categories typically include.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Research and Development: Finding Something New</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Research and Development</em> (<em>R&amp;D</em>) is money spent to create new products or to significantly improve existing products. The classic example is the drug company that spends millions in the laboratories exploring diseases for which there’s no known cure, in the hope of an exciting discovery that will justify all the R&amp;D expense. It doesn’t always work out that way, of course, and most R&amp;D expenditures are ultimately unproductive in terms of developing a marketable product. Still, a company that depends on a flow of new products to survive in the marketplace must allocate a portion of its annual spending to R&amp;D if it is to stay in business.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Closely related are groupings of expenses that are often called <em>Engineering Expenses</em>. Some companies prefer this label, perhaps because they don’t think of themselves as engaged in basic research, but rather in using engineering methodologies to improve what’s already known about their business.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Farther down the line from basic research and engineering is an area called <em>Product Development</em>. This is the cost of taking the fruits of that research to develop products that can be sold, e.g., a cure for the common cold in simple pill form. Product development can also include expenditures intended to improve existing products, such as a better nasal spray or even a better dispenser for that nasal spray.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>These are all costs that a company incurs to find something new to sell. A company that can afford to spend more for R&amp;D has a better chance of staying ahead of its competitors. Having better products sooner than others should provide an edge, at least for a while. As you can see, a company will be motivated to allocate as much of its resources as possible to R&amp;D in the belief that it will pay off in sales. R&amp;D is a cost the company incurs before it will have the opportunity to make a sale and then as it’s making sales, to ensure that sales will continue. In other words, R&amp;D is a cost of doing business that must be financed out of the gross profit.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_60"></a><strong>Sales and Marketing Expenses: Positioning the Company to Sell Something</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">We noted earlier that the direct costs of making a sale, such as commissions for salespeople, are often reported as a part of the cost of sales. Beyond those costs directly related to making a sale, substantial effort and costs go into creating and maintaining a sales and marketing presence.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><em>Marketing Costs</em> are all those expenditures a company makes to find out what people want to buy from it, to interest people in its products, and to create prospects for the company’s sales force. Typically, none of these costs are directly related to making a sale, yet they’re necessary to create a steady flow of prospective buyers for the salespeople. Market research, brand development, website development and maintenance, advertising, and test marketing are examples of marketing costs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><em>Selling Expenses,</em> by comparison, are the costs of actually selling the company’s products and services. This includes putting salespeople in the field to call on prospects and get orders or on the telephone to take orders. It also includes distributing sales brochures, the shopping cart on that website, trade shows, and all the support costs of the sales organization. Sales and marketing, then, is another cost of doing business.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>General and Administrative Expenses: Running the Back Office and Paying the Rent</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The third common category of expense is <em>General and Administrative Expense</em> (<em>G&amp;A</em>). This is sort of the “all other” category, because it includes everything not grouped under some other heading. If it’s not production, research, development, engineering, sales, or marketing, then it must be G&amp;A. Examples include executive salaries, Accounting and Human Resources personnel, many corporate and employee welfare costs, and all the costs of supporting the company’s administrative organization. Yep, another cost of doing business.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev29"><strong>Operating Income: The Basic Business Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The next important measure of overall profitability—<em>Operating Income</em>—is the profit that comes from doing what the company is in business to do. This key number is not yet the “bottom line” we so often refer to, but it’s close. It’s usually the result of the company’s normal business activities, before unusual, nonrecurring, or financially related items that are often considered incidental to what the company is in business to do.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">

<p class="noindent">Back in 2002 IBM was criticized for selling a small subsidiary company at a profit and recording the profit in its income statement under G&amp;A. Putting the profit into that category effectively reduced the G&amp;A expense reported for that year. This is a desirable thing for stockholders to see in a report because it implies that a presumably ongoing expense has been reduced. In fact, this was a one-time-only item, ongoing G&amp;A had not been reduced, and some stockholders and media reporters felt misled by the presentation. IBM said the profit was so small it was immaterial. But the idea still raised questions in the minds of investors and the media, probably because it was seen as still another example of loose financial reporting by public companies, an issue that was exploding on the news scene at the time.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev30"><strong>EBITDA—He Bit Who?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Nowhere to be seen on Wonder Widget’s income statement is the term seen so often on reports issued by a growing number of companies in recent years, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. Folks who fancy buzzwords will appreciate the buzzword for this one—EBITDA, pronounced “ee-bit-dah.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><em>EBITDA</em> is a way to present operating income modified for readers who aren’t concerned about the financially oriented charges that it excludes. Consider a profit center within a company—perhaps a division whose job is simply to produce operating income. The division general manager is not concerned with corporate office decisions about how to finance the business (that removes interest expense from the calculation of EBITDA), how long to depreciate its assets (that removes depreciation and amortization expense), or how to pay or defer its taxes (that removes income taxes). The resulting calculation is closer to a pure operating income at the unit level, perhaps where this measurement got its initial support.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Later on, of course, it began to appear on the income statements of companies with heavy investments in equipment and heavy debt loads, as a way to show their earnings without the burden of these financial charges. For our purposes, think of it as a different version of operating income.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><a id="page_62"></a><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)</strong> A financial measure for evaluating a company often used as an approximation of operating cash flow, it came into use during the dot-com era to more favorably present the results of technology companies that had incurred large capital costs—thus depreciation and interest expense—but as yet had little in the way of earnings to show for it.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>But let’s get back to what our income statement actually shows.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev31"><strong>Other Income and Expenses: Not Just Odds and Ends</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentb">Finally, we come to the <em>Nonoperating Items,</em> such as interest expense on borrowed money and profits or losses on selling nonbusiness assets that are likely to happen in the normal course of doing business but are not part of running the business. Typical examples include:</p>
<p class="list-box-1a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Interest income and interest expense, considered financial costs and not operating costs (unless your company is an insurance company or a bank, for which the rules are different);</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Gain or loss on selling off equipment no longer used by the company;</p>
<p class="list-box-2a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Gain or loss on the disposition of investments that were incidental to the business.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="none">  </span>These items appear near the bottom of the income statement so that they don’t detract from the reader’s conclusions about how well the normal business of the company is going. While typically small in relation to the business operations, they are not necessarily minor. In fact, some of them can become very large in relation to net income, especially if the company’s profit margins are modest. An example might be the sale of unused land the company has held for many years, often at a price many times greater than the value at which it was carried on the company’s books. When such infrequent or one-time items grow very large, they are most likely labeled <em>Extraordinary Items</em> and are shown separately, sometimes even with a separate calculation of earnings per share to show their impact on the bottom line.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev32"><a id="page_63"></a><strong>Income Before Taxes, Income Taxes, and Net Income</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">We’re coming to the bottom of the page, and we see a number often called <em>Pretax Income</em>. The formal label you will most often see is <em>Income Before Taxes,</em> although there are variations of that as well, for reasons that even I don’t understand. In any event, they all mean the same thing—the income on which the company expects to pay tax, the amount on which its income tax estimate is based. Immediately following that comes the income tax estimate, usually called <em>Provision for Income Taxes</em> or something like that.</p>

<p class="noindent">OK, not wrong because they were calculated incorrectly, but because they’re rarely the actual amounts reported on the company’s tax returns. They’re estimates, and often not even based on the tax returns actually filed, but on a complex calculation that blends GAAP and the tax laws. So take these numbers with a grain of salt and don’t expect to see them on the company’s tax returns. No matter, though, because the difference isn’t usually controllable.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The number that matters most comes last, <em>Net Income</em>. This is the real bottom line. It’s the financial result of everything the company has done for the period being reported, after all the reasons, the excuses, the bragging, and the complaining. This is it—the final act, the last number you’ll see. Well, almost.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev33"><strong>Earnings per Share, Before and After Dilution—What?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">For a privately owned company and its principals, nothing matters after Net Income. But if your company is publicly traded and the financial statement is one of the quarterly or annual reports issued to stockholders and the news media, what seems to matter more than net income is a little thing called <em>Net Income per Share of Stock Owned by Stockholders,</em> better known as <em>Earnings per Share</em> (<em>EPS</em>).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_64"></a>In this calculation, net income is divided by the number of shares held by all the owners. The result is the amount of that net income (or loss) that is allocable to each share of stock. This is a powerful number in the hands of a media representative, an investment advisor, or an investment banker touting an upcoming stock offering. Why so much attention? It’s the easiest way an individual who owns 100 shares of General Motors stock can tell how his or her ownership participated in the company’s huge earnings, just as effectively as the investor who owns 100,000 shares of GM. All those reporters and advisors have made EPS one of the principal gauges of a company’s profit performance, and thereby, one of the principal indicators of the stock’s possible price performance.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Earnings per share fully diluted</strong> Common stock earnings per share calculated as if all stock options and warrants were exercised and if all convertible preferred stock and convertible debt were converted into common stock, thus increasing the number of common shares that will share net income. Also termed <em>Fully Diluted Earnings per Share.</em></p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indentb"><span class="none">  </span>The only problem is that there’s no one number for EPS, with the result that many companies routinely report two such numbers: <em>Earnings per Share</em> and <em>Earnings per Share Fully Diluted</em>. Huh? Why two? Well, it’s often the case that some company employees—and perhaps others—hold options to buy some of that stock, and they may be waiting for the right time. In the interim, they represent the possibility that there will be more people dividing up that net income than there are now. That is called <em>dilution</em>. Dilution can come in a variety of other ways, too, including:</p>
<p class="list-box-1a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  <strong>Warrants,</strong> a kind of option given to banks and other financial institutions as extra payment for a loan or a public stock offering;</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  <strong>Convertible preferred stock,</strong> a class of shares that can be converted into common stock; and</p>

<p class="noindent">Let’s suppose you bought 10,000 shares of XYZ stock and there are 100 million shares outstanding (including yours). Now, suppose the company reports net income of $100 million for last year. A little quick arithmetic shows us that’s $1 per share of earnings for each of those 100 million shares outstanding. Now let’s suppose that the <em>price/earnings ratio</em> in the marketplace is 20. That would make the likely value of each of your shares $20 and your investment would be worth $200,000. If you bought the stock for $18, you now have a $20,000 profit (on paper).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>But wait! There are some stock option holders out there who could purchase 5 million shares of XYZ. They like the earnings report as much as you do, so they all exercise their options right after the report. Now there are 105 million shares outstanding to divide up that $100 million in income, so each share now has claim on only 95 cents of earnings, not $1. At the same P/E ratio of 20, your shares are now worth $19 each, not $20. Because of this dilution, your profit drops from $20,000 to $10,000—a drop of 50 percent.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>As the “For Example” sidebar shows above, dilution can significantly affect earnings per share. Accounting rules say you must be able to easily see the effects on EPS if all those option holders exercise their options. Fully diluted earnings per share is almost always shown below the regular (primary) EPS on a public company’s income statement. That way you can see what your smaller share of earnings would be under the worst case and make your investment decisions accordingly.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Price/earnings (P/E) ratio</strong> The relationship between a stock’s price and its earnings per share, calculated by dividing the current price per share by the earnings per share for the most recent 12-month period. For example, a stock selling for $50 a share and earning $5 a share has a P/E ratio of 10. The ratio—the most common measure of how expensive a stock is—gives investors a rough idea of how much they’re paying for earning power. Also termed <em>earnings multiple, P/E multiple,</em> or <em>multiple</em>.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev34"><a id="page_66"></a><strong>Using This Report Effectively</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The income statement is a useful tool for understanding a company’s performance in a high-level way. Internal income statements used by company managers are typically more useful than those generated for outsiders because they contain details not presented in the published, highly summarized versions. The best way to use an income statement is to put it alongside income statements for prior periods or against the expectations of the company (the budget) or against income statements of other, similar companies. It’s by comparison against some benchmark that the income statement has its greatest value. This kind of comparison enables you to assign a performance grade that’s not possible when you look only at a statement for a single period.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev35"><strong>Manager’s Checklist for <a href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a></strong></h3>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Don’t be confused by all the line item labels on income statements. The labels are attempts to adapt to top management’s preferences or to unique aspects of one company or industry compared with others. Look for the common thread; marketing is marketing, even if the label is a little different.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Don’t be fooled by accounting tricks. Remember that sales belong in the periods in which they were earned and completed, not necessarily where they make the company look good.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Review the few, key numbers on an income statement: sales, gross profit, operating income or EBITDA, and net income. These are the numbers most often reviewed by those with an interest in the company to measure profit performance.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> The income statement is the most familiar measure of a company’s performance over a period of time. The statement’s usefulness increases substantially when compared with a benchmark, such as a budget, prior month, or prior year. The comparison enables you to better judge the company’s performance.</p>
