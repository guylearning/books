<h2 class="h2"><strong>Counting the Beans: Why Good Financial Information Is Critical to You</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>T</strong></span></span>he young adults of every generation believe the business environment in which they work is tougher than ever before. Today we are no exception. And those who follow us will likely be no exception. Well, guess what? Everybody’s right!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1"><strong>Managing a Company in Today’s Business Environment</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">As business gets more competitive, more global, more technologically driven, it gets easier for others to compete with you. It gets harder to be successful by just doing OK. It gets harder to launch a good product and enjoy the benefits of your innovation for long without serious competition. And, yes, it does get tougher to make a living. In our parents’ time, performance that was good enough to get by and make a decent living isn’t good enough today. You may have read that many of us will fail to achieve the relative standard of living that our parents did because of this tougher world. It was recently reported that U.S. workers don’t begin to earn a median-wage income (about $42,000) until they are 30 years old (<em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> September 30, 2013). Of course, if you’ve been alive for the past 10 or 15 years, you also know that there are unprecedented opportunities to create new wealth, new products, new companies, and new fortunes. It’s unlikely that our forefathers could <a id="page_2"></a>have imagined fortunes being made, and lost, as quickly as they were in the last decade.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>So it’s hard to dispute that times are more challenging now. The question is: What can you do about it? The answer: You can’t do much about the times, but you can do a lot about how you prepare for them. And that’s what this book is about.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>When I was a youngster, my father owned and ran a small grocery store that supplied the neighbors with their daily household needs. This was long before supermarkets killed the mom-and-pops that existed then in every neighborhood. When school was over, I went to the store to help out my parents. My first job was opening cases of packaged goods, pricing the packages, and stocking the shelves. Then I packed groceries and delivered them to customers, sometimes after taking their order over the phone and personally filling it. (Yes, that was how many small stores did business back then.) Then I graduated to cutting meat in the fresh meat department. When I was in junior high school, I was working the cash register, opening the store in the morning, and finally, running the store when my parents went on a rare vacation. By the time I was in high school, I had run every aspect of a small business, including setting up and closing out the cash register and doing the bookkeeping at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In today’s business terms, I had worked in Shipping/Receiving, Warehousing and Inventory Control, Production, Sales, Delivery, Billing and Collection, Accounting, and General Management.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Uncommon today? Yes, and yet that kind of diverse background is exactly what’s increasingly demanded of today’s up-and-coming professionals. Not necessarily in delivering groceries, but in many other ways. Managers in companies large and small—including directors, vice presidents, and general managers—are finding their particular specialties aren’t going to carry them to the finish line as they might once have. Today’s report card on performance includes finance, and that has caught many managers by surprise.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>A generation ago, senior managers and company executives were challenged by the arrival of the personal computer and their lack of knowledge of this new tool. No matter how firmly they knew their own particular areas of expertise, the young professionals coming into the <a id="page_3"></a>business often made their bosses look old-fashioned with their mastery of this impressive and intimidating technology. Soon, those young professionals had children, whose computer acumen after being on the planet for only a few years made even their savvy parents sit up and take notice. And so it goes. We need more knowledge of more subjects to succeed. Technology and finance are making demands on us in new ways virtually every year.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Now finance and accounting impact many companies in ways managers outside the financial department never thought about. The accounting scandals at the start of this century (Enron, Worldcom, and others) showed that financial incompetence or carelessness or simply lack of integrity could wipe out the efforts (and jobs) of thousands of loyal, hard-working employees. Then the financial meltdown of 2008–2010 showed that even the financial “experts” didn’t always know what they were doing. Their mistakes (or willful ignorance) contributed to the near-collapse of the financial system, throwing the global economy into the deepest recession since the Great Depression. The report card, it seems, has become more important than it ever was when we were in school. Today’s business “report card” is its financial report.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Today we’re finding that we need to know how to read that report card just to keep our jobs, let alone advance in our careers. Boards of directors now need to delve into a company’s financial reports to a degree never before contemplated. They need to understand—and even challenge—financial terminology and accounting methods they might previously have taken for granted. CEOs now must be completely aware of what their people are doing and the financial ramifications, because saying they didn’t know is no longer an acceptable excuse. Managers within a company, large or small, must understand the basic rules of accounting and finance well enough to avoid getting into trouble while aggressively trying to make their goals. Those who aspire to become managers may not even get a start up the ladder until they can demonstrate this kind of knowledge. So you see, the need for a basic understanding of finance touches everyone.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Financial scandals make headlines, but they aren’t going to make anyone learn more about finance and accounting. What’s the real reason to know this stuff? Consider the new manager who is asked to prepare a budget for his or her department.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Budget</strong> A projection of the detailed income and expenses that are estimated to occur in a specified future period, usually prepared on a month-to-month basis for up to a year. Each item of income and expense is listed, along with the amount each is expected to add to or subtract from the profit for the period.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>How do you begin to pull together a budget? How about sales? Do you start with what you hope you can sell? What you’re sure you can sell? What you sold last year or last month? What management will believe?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>OK, if that’s too confusing, maybe you could start with expenses. What do you need to spend? What you spent last year or last month? What you hope you can get approval to spend? Do you know what everything will cost?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Just knowing where to begin is a challenge. And then how do you decide how much money or staffing you’ll need to reach your goals or that your boss wants you to achieve?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Whew! Why can’t the finance department do this for you?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The truth is, they can’t. Oh, sure, finance can prepare something that looks like a budget, and in many companies that’s what happens. But then it’s not really your budget; it’s theirs. If you miss the target finance sets, well, it’s not really your problem, now, is it? As managers we know that each department understands its unique needs and capabilities better than anyone else. And we know from Management 101 that a goal must be accepted—better yet, owned—by the people who actually will do the work for there to be a strong commitment to achieving it. Simply put, that’s why each department within the organization must do its own budget and, therefore, why its managers must learn to budget effectively. And, yes, you’ll need to be able to answer, at some level, all the questions I’ve raised above. Happily, <a href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</a> in this book will help you do that.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev2"><strong>The Role of the Finance Department</strong></h3>
<h4 class="h4a"><strong>The Two Sides of Finance</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The Finance Department has two distinct jobs to perform in most companies: managing the company’s financial resources (finance) and recording and reporting all its financial transactions (accounting). Today many small and midsized companies don’t establish separate Finance and Accounting departments. A company might instead have a chief financial officer (CFO) who performs or oversees the company’s finance functions and accounting activities. Larger companies are likely to have separate departments for finance and accounting that report to the CFO.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><a id="page_5"></a><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Chief Financial Officer (CFO)</strong> The job title of the executive in charge of all the financial activities in all large companies and most midsized ones. Smaller companies might instead place their financial activities under a vice president for finance or a controller, depending on how they define the responsibilities of these people.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Finance</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The Finance Department may be responsible for an assortment of functions, depending on the company. It might oversee insurance and risk management, contract pricing and administration, internal auditing, investor relations, and more. At a minimum, Finance is likely responsible for treasury activities (cash management, etc.), often under the direction of an executive with the title of treasurer or vice president for finance. His or her role likely includes cash management, bank relations, investments, and everything having to do with making sure the organization has enough cash to pay its employees and its bills, and productively investing excess cash.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">

<p class="image-r"><img src="caution.jpg" alt="Image" width="80" height="104"/></p>
<p class="side-title"><strong>D<small>ON</small>’<small>T</small> J<small>UDGE THE</small> E<small>XECUTIVE</small> B<small>OOK BY</small> I<small>TS</small> C<small>OVER</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">While we’ve tried to give you a general idea of what job titles might do which jobs, these are generalizations that do not apply to every company, and maybe not yours. Some companies are more liberal than others in granting titles. Others might employ less commonly used titles such as director of finance or vice president of administration or even manager of accounting for the head financial executive in their organization. If you need to determine exactly who does what, obtain an organization chart or ask someone in Human Resources or Finance. It could spare you embarrassment or, even worse, getting the wrong information.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_6"></a>Major activities like mergers and acquisitions, attracting investment capital, and internal management of public stock offerings usually fall within the Finance Department’s responsibility, because that’s all about making sure the company has enough cash to carry out its plans. When a company decides to sell its stock in the public marketplace for the first time—in an initial public offering (IPO)—it almost always places the task of coordinating that transition in the hands of the Finance Department.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Accounting</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The accounting job is typically done by the Accounting Department, led by an accounting manager, controller, comptroller, or someone with a similar title. These folks record all the transactions that occur as the company does its business and then prepare reports that help them, company management, and outside constituencies understand the financial impact of those transactions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The accountants maintain the accounting software, process all the paperwork that documents transactions that have occurred, and record them into the company’s general ledger. Most of these transactions are recorded in dollars and cents, or the appropriate foreign currency for operations outside the United States. Some transactions keep track of other units of measure besides currency, such as the number of pieces of inventory in the warehouse, the number of vehicles in the company fleet, and so on.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>General ledger</strong> The principal accounting record to which all company transactions are recorded and summarized. The general ledger is the record from which information for the basic financial reports is drawn. These reports vary greatly in look and wording among organizations. General ledgers were once huge books maintained with carefully handwritten entries, but today nearly all entries are documented with computer software.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Of course, keeping records of financial transactions tucked away in some computer serves no one unless we can get access to the information when we need it. So, from all those transaction records the accountants prepare a variety of reports. Some are for people outside your company, such as government agencies, your bankers, investors, and stockholders. But the reports that are most important to running the company are those the accountants prepare for company managers, for it is these reports that managers use to understand their company’s financial past and present, and make decisions about its financial future.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_7"></a>As you will learn later in this book or as you may already have discovered the hard way, the readability of those reports is a huge factor in their value. To put it another way, you can’t use a report you don’t understand, no matter how valuable the information it contains.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Unfortunately, some managers view the computerized financial reports produced by their company’s accounting programs as technical, irrelevant, and nearly useless in their decision making. (We discuss some of these reports in depth in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="ch04.html#ch04">4</a>.) Managers often have good reason to feel that way, it seems to me, because these basic financial reports were designed for use by outsiders! Their primary purpose is to give a snapshot of a company’s financial condition to people outside the company—bankers, government regulators, stock analysts, investors, and others who have no direct role in running the company. Despite this, these reports provide a summary of the company’s monthly or quarterly operations. They present this information in a standard, consistent, and familiar format, which makes them credible and more useful. They also serve as the basis for more tailored and typically more useful reports, which we discuss later in this book. How do we do that? With a fictitious company that does everything right, of course.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev3"><strong>The Wonder Widget Company Is Our Guide</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Learning is easier and more effective when students can picture the thing being learned in context with something already familiar to them. On the assumption that you are working in a company now—otherwise why would you care about this stuff?—the context that makes the most sense is a simulated company. Our imaginary company uses the tools we discuss, issues the reports we talk about, and is challenged to understand their financial data to run their company more effectively.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Allow me to introduce The Wonder Widget Company, a manufacturer of premium-quality widgets that are sold across the country by a team of strong in-house salespeople. Wonder Widget is privately owned, so we don’t have to deal with its stock price or the public company reporting <a id="page_8"></a>rules published by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which would needlessly complicate our lives as it does for today’s public companies. Although I occasionally bring in a topic that mostly applies to public companies (e.g., stock price or equity financing), my assumption is that you want to learn about finance, not government regulations, stockholder lawsuits, and investor relations. Besides, the vast majority of companies in this country are privately owned, so chances are good that your employer is a privately owned company. Throughout this book, we follow Wonder Widget and learn how its managers deal with the financial issues they must address.</p>

<p class="noindent">Some accounting departments produce reports that they never distribute outside their department simply because no one has ever asked for them. These reports, perhaps produced as part of a standard computerized process or to serve a limited departmental purpose, might contain information that could be useful to you—indeed, it could be the information you’ve been trying to collect on the back of an envelope for months. If your Accounting Department doesn’t know you want a report, it’s unlikely to go looking for you when the report is printed. Tell Accounting what you would like to know and ask what kinds of reports are produced that don’t get distributed. There just may be a gem hidden in the Accounting file cabinet or stored on the company’s computer network.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev4"><strong>The “Rules” of Financial Reporting</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The standard format for recording and reporting financial transactions in the United States is outlined in guidelines, or rules, called <em>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</em> (<em>GAAP</em>). These guidelines are published by the accounting profession (with some gentle prodding from the U.S. government) and have been evolving ever since their origin in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash. They are intended to be the foundation upon which readers of these reports can gauge a company’s progress, compare one company or one accounting period with another, and judge the financial effectiveness of a company’s management efforts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_9"></a>As we’ve seen, it doesn’t always work out that way, but that’s not necessarily because the rules are flawed. The job of creating comparable accounting and reporting standards for widely varied businesses is a daunting task for the folks who set the standards. The objective of each accounting rule is to record a transaction so that it makes economic sense for the company and for readers of the company’s reports. Yet to achieve that objective, accountants in two dissimilar companies might need to record the same transaction differently. And that’s just in the United States. Consider the additional complications of creating comparability for a company that operates in more than one country, or in some cases dozens of countries, each with regulators holding different views of what accounting rules should look like.</p>

<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</strong> A set of rules, conventions, standards, and procedures established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and its predecessors for reporting financial information in a consistent manner to facilitate understanding and comparison.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>That’s been the dilemma for financial reporting since companies started operating globally after the end of World War II. By the late 1900s the recognized need for international standards led to the creation of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), followed by various levels of collaboration between the United States and the European Union to try to agree on a common set of reporting rules. It’s a work in progress, and likely will be for many more years, given the usual political and economic differences between the countries that most influence rule setting. The main reason for discussing it here is to make you aware that some financial reports of companies with multinational operations might employ IASB rules, while other companies reporting in the United States may employ GAAP under the U.S.-based FASB.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Why do you care? For most of us it’s a minor issue because differences are often subtle and esoteric. But for those of you who are serious investors outside your work, comparisons between U.S. and foreign companies often have anomalies you should be aware of.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>OK, let’s get back to understanding the differences among U.S. companies operating under GAAP. Some of these differences are far from trivial.</p>

<p class="noindent">Two companies purchase identical Ford Taurus automobiles. Company A will use its vehicle for occasional corporate visitors, so it’s expected to last about five years. Company B will add its new Ford to its fleet of taxis, so the car is expected to last only about 18 months. Over which of the following periods of time would an accountant in each of these companies depreciate or expense the purchase?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The choice of how quickly to depreciate a car (or other asset) will affect the profits of the company that buys it. The choices companies make must reflect their particular circumstances. Wrong choices could lead to confusion and misstatement. However, setting one absolute rule for all companies would create different problems and perhaps greater confusion. This need for some flexibility is why we have generally accepted accounting <em>principles,</em> rather than <em>rules</em>. These principles have been the basis for reasonable estimates and unreasonable abuses for many years, with the abuses typically getting a lot more press.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Incidentally, the correct answer is the last choice.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>

<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>We devote a fair amount of time in this book to helping you understand how to read and use these primary financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP. We also discuss special-purpose reports that company management may find useful for internal purposes. Our comments in all cases assume the use of GAAP, except where we specifically note exceptions.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev5"><strong>The Relationship of Finance and Accounting to the Other Departments</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Finance Department in every company has, in theory, two primary areas of responsibility:</p>
<p class="num-list-t"><span class="none">  </span>1. Finance must safeguard company assets by properlyx1 accounting for them, instituting internal controls to prevent their misuse or loss, and generally monitoring their proper use. In this role, Finance becomes a policing activity, making sure others don’t damage the company through their actions.</p>
<p class="num-list-b"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_11"></a>2. Finance organizes all the data it collects about company transactions and presents that data in a form everyone in the company can use to most effectively manage their own functions and the company as a whole. In this sense, Finance provides information to help other departments—its customers—do their jobs, and ideally to do them better.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>While these functions should generally carry equal importance for company management, they aren’t always carried out with equal enthusiasm by financial departments. In some companies, financial departments focus more on assertive policing than on serving the users of financial information. Policy constraints and procedural labyrinths seem to be the predominant preoccupation of these accountants, to the frustration of many outside the Finance Department. Yet in other companies, the strong direction of operationally driven management can result in a financial department that’s totally occupied with servicing a continuous flow of requests for ad hoc information, at the expense of the protection function. In these companies, folks outside of Finance get their needs met, but auditors and others outside the company may become concerned about the safety of the company’s assets and the efficient use of its resources.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In a perfect world, then, these functions would be balanced in a way that serves the best interests of the company’s owners. A financial department that implements adequate internal controls and enforces them with appropriate levels of enthusiasm would have time and resources to serve the reasonable information needs of the enterprise as well. However, in reality, finding this balance is one of the most challenging management jobs in the company.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev6"><strong>Manager’s Checklist for <a href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a></strong></h3>
<p class="check-i-1"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Managers need to understand the rules of accounting and the boundaries of proper finance well enough to avoid getting into trouble as they aggressively pursue their goals.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> The Finance Department has two distinct jobs to perform in most companies: managing the company’s financial resources (finance) and recording and reporting all its financial transactions (accounting).</p>
