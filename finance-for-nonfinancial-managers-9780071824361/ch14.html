<h2 class="h2"><strong>Attracting Outside Investors: The Entrepreneur’s Path</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>T</strong></span></span>he United States is without question the entrepreneurial capital of the world. More people start businesses here than anywhere else on the planet, and more of them succeed here than anywhere else. Of course, it’s also likely true that more of them fail here than anywhere else. But entrepreneurs keep trying, because that’s the kind of capitalist system we have. People know that if they try and succeed, they’ll be rewarded, both financially and socially. Even if they try and fail, they know they won’t be ostracized. On the contrary, they might even get another chance.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Some entrepreneurs tell stories of several failures before they finally achieved success, and they tell those stories with understandable pride—pride in their own perseverance and achievement, and pride in a capitalist economy and political system that not only permit but encourage that kind of effort. Some professional investors even give special credit to entrepreneurs who’ve had a failure, feeling that it makes them smarter and less likely to repeat their mistakes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Most major universities have undergraduate education programs designed specifically for would-be entrepreneurs, and many universities provide opportunities for students to form companies while still in school. Icons Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Mark Zuckerberg were high school entrepreneurs. All started their businesses while in college and all left school before graduation to build the companies that would revolutionize <a id="page_222"></a>the personal computing and social media industries.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Entrepreneur</strong> A businessperson who starts a company with the intention from the beginning of (1) growing it to be much larger than would be necessary to simply provide an income to the owner, and (typically) (2) selling it at some point—either to the public through a stock offering or to another company—for a substantial profit.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Many start-up businesses, notably the technology-related companies that popped up so prolifically over the past 15–20 years, have needed financial support from outside investors to get started and get their first products to market. Others needed outside investors to expand their companies. Yet today the game has changed dramatically as a result of the investment bubbles during that same period. Results are expected sooner and more reliably, both in profit and cash flow.</p>
<p class="indentb"><span class="none">  </span>Dave Berkus, the entrepreneur/investor first mentioned in <a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, noted in a blog post that</p>
<p class="indent-P"><span class="none">      </span>The days of being able to trust that there will be an investor or lender on the other end of a call or email whenever needed ended with the 2000 and 2008 bursts of those respective bubbles. <em>It’s entirely possible that Amazon could not be created and funded today with its planned seven years until profitability.</em></p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="none">  </span>Many sources for investment capital are potentially available to the promising or proven entrepreneur. Sometimes the money comes at first from the founder’s own pocket, from savings or borrowing against the house or raiding the kids’ college fund. But often the money comes from others who have heard about the entrepreneur’s dream and want to be a part of it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>This chapter is an overview of investment capital sources for the entrepreneur, from the first dollar invested to the last dollar before the entrepreneur sells what he or she has built. The discussion generally follows the order in which the entrepreneur would tap those sources of capital. Keep in mind that a particular company may not need all these stages to reach profitability and cash self-sufficiency, and some need them all, depending on the enterprise’s complexity and the difficulty in establishing a successful market position.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_223"></a>When an entrepreneur wants to start a company and needs more money than he or she has in the bank or can borrow, here are the places to go knocking with that exciting, well-written business plan in hand. These are the investors.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev99"><strong>The Start-Up Company: Seed Money and Its Sources</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Regardless of how difficult it is, the entrepreneur starting a company from scratch must almost always put up the initial money from his or her own resources, for several reasons:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  There may be no one else who believes the idea can work until the entrepreneur proves it and can attract investments.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The founder wants to keep as much of the stock ownership as possible and believes, or at least hopes, to succeed without outside funding.</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Potential investors have suggested to the entrepreneur that they may invest, but only if the entrepreneur first invests meaningful personal funds. This is referred to as having “skin in the game.” (Don’t ask how the analogy arose. I don’t think either of us wants to know!)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>So, the entrepreneur calls on savings, talks his or her spouse into refinancing the house, or asks the parents, aunts and uncles, and close friends to invest. Such sources are typically, and usually accurately, referred to as <em>friends and family</em>. These people are usually good sources for initial capital (<em>seed money</em>), because they have known the entrepreneur a long time and have faith in him or her or because they feel enough empathy for the entrepreneur’s efforts to be willing to take more risks than more objective investors might.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>This initial injection of money enables two important changes to take place:</p>
<p class="num-list-t"><span class="none">  </span>1. The entrepreneur becomes a founder, president, and CEO who now has the opportunity to begin to prove that his or her idea is good enough to attract investors.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>2. The entrepreneur can move from idea to reality. He or she can set up an office, develop the business, hire employees, and create a business plan to serve as the brochure for the next round in the continuing search for capital.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev100"><a id="page_224"></a><strong>Professional Investors: Angels on a Mission</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Once the start-up company has a little momentum, perhaps with a prototype of an invention or a product, some interested potential buyers, and a few paying customers, the founder may be in a position to tell a compelling story to potential investors. These may be individuals who’ve made some money beyond what they need for their personal and business use and have set aside some of that money to invest in other people’s new ideas. These investors are called <em>angels</em> because they often come to the rescue of the entrepreneur and invest when no one else is willing or able.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>One thing to keep in mind about professional investors that might not have been as true during the wild ride of the early 2000s: The expectation of actual revenue as the real “proof of concept” is more a requirement today than ever before. Investors burned by concepts that never attracted revenue are unwilling to be burned a second time. They’ve learned that the best proof of an idea’s viability is when customers pay for it.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Angel investor</strong> An individual who invests in start-up or emerging companies on his or her own account, rather than as part of a formal organization or company. Usually an individual with some personal wealth and prior management or investing experience. These “angels” may seek investment opportunities on their own or they may join angel groups in an informal “angel network,” similar to an early-stage investment club, to find opportunities that appeal to several group members.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Angels don’t do this because they are foolish, but because they have a greater risk tolerance than other folks and because their background often makes them uniquely able and willing to assist a start-up company with ideas, introductions, and advice in addition to money.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>What Angel Investors Want to See</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">How does an entrepreneur attract the interest of angels? These potential investors typically are attracted by:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  A reasonably well-written business plan outlining the concept and the investment premise;</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  A founder with sufficient business management experience to convince the investor that he or she can carry out the plan’s promise;</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_225"></a><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  A demonstration in some form of the product or service that allows angels to judge the likelihood that the entrepreneur will achieve what the business plan defines as success;</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  An organization with a reasonable management team in place and ready to carry out the plan, and at least a few paying customers to help prove market potential; or</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  As many of the things on the venture capitalists’ list (in the next section) as possible.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Proof of concept</strong> The evidence an entrepreneur accumulates to prove to potential investors that the entrepreneur’s business model is viable, meaning it’s good enough to attract customers, revenue, and profits. That’s harder to do for very early-stage development companies than it is for companies that have progressed sufficiently to have some satisfied customers.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The first professional investor to take a chance on a company is typically able to obtain a substantial ownership percentage in the company in return for the investment. The early-stage investor commands a strong ownership position because he or she is taking a chance very early in the game, when the risk of loss is correspondingly higher and when some parts of the idea are yet unproven.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>A first-round professional investor often takes an active role in helping the company grow. The early investor serves on the board of directors and/or advisory board. He or she may help the founder attract key executives to the management team or, if the need is acute and the company is not ready for high-level employees, strategic management consultants. The investor typically provides guidance; many are seasoned executives or entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>For some companies, these early-stage investors provide all the outside capital needed to reach profitability. A start-up company that does not require huge cash infusions for R&amp;D may be able to build sales momentum early on and use much of its investors’ money to establish market position and put a sales organization in place. This investment strategy hastens the climb to profits and self-sufficiency, and enables the <a id="page_226"></a>investors to earn a good return on their money in a shorter time than might otherwise be possible.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>A successful launch without any additional investment beyond the angels’ contributions is not the normal situation, however, as start-up companies typically take five to seven years or more before their investors can convert their investment back into cash. The more typical start-up that requires investor capital needs several infusions or rounds of capital before it’s self-sufficient in terms of cash flow. Early-round money may be needed to prove the soundness of the business concept, to begin the development of the product or service, and to start building the organization.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Perhaps most important to the founder who will need more money as the company gains momentum, first-round investors may facilitate introductions to later-stage investors willing to invest larger amounts of money based on the company’s results, thus enabling further progress toward profitability and a handsome return for all. Prominent among these next-stage investors are the money managers known as venture capitalists.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev101"><strong>Venture Capitalists: What You Need to Know to Attract Them</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">When more money is needed than angels can provide or when angels want others to invest to support their early stakes, a young company may seek out institutional investors, the folks known as <em>venture capitalists</em> (<em>VCs</em> to those inclined to buzzwords).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>A manager for the institutional investors, usually also a VC, evaluates the investment opportunity, makes the investing decision, and monitors the investment’s performance over time, with the hope of selling the shares at a profit for the investors (and for the VC him- or herself, since these folks usually accumulate shares for their personal accounts along the way, sometimes by direct investment and sometimes in the form of options or warrants for their services). In one outsized success story, Facebook raised over $1.3 billion in venture funding before its momentous $16 billion IPO. Virtually every start-up company in the Internet technology space whose name you’ve heard of raised millions from investors before they were able to support themselves from profitable operations.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Venture capitalist (VC)</strong> A member of a firm that invests in emerging companies, many in start-up mode, typically for others rather than for their own account, often by starting an investment fund and convincing other institutions, corporations, or wealthy individuals to passively invest in the fund, and then finding good investment opportunities. VCs also guide the growth and subsequent funding of their portfolio companies until they are either sold to other companies or to the public in a public offering of shares (see “The Initial Public Offering” below).</p>

<h4 class="h4"><strong>What Venture Capitalists Want to See</strong></h4>

<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  A polished business plan demonstrating solid thinking with regard to all the key success factors, the inhibitors to success, and the advantages of the proposed product or service;</p>

<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The potential to grow to a valuation at least 10 times greater than the valuation at which the investors purchase their shares.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Valuation</strong> The venture’s proposed total market value, which determines the amount of ownership interest any investor will receive. Since this valuation is an estimate of a company that typically has little value in traditional terms (sales and earnings), it’s as much a negotiation between the company, the underwriters, and the venture capitalists as it is a calculation.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><em>Valuation</em> is the term that defines the venture’s proposed total market value, which in turn defines the amount of ownership interest the investors will receive. By way of an example, a venture may <a id="page_228"></a>be valued at $5 million by the founder, who might want to raise $2.5 million. The founder’s calculation might go as shown in <a href="ch14.html#ch14fig1">Figure 14-1</a>:</p>
<div class="group">
<p class="fig-img"><a id="ch14fig1"></a><img src="f0246-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="545" height="232"/></p>
<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 14-1.</strong> The entrepreneur’s calculation</p>
</div>
<p class="indenttb"><span class="none">  </span>The venture capitalist, on the other hand, might look at it as shown in <a href="ch14.html#ch14fig2">Figure 14-2</a>:</p>
<div class="group">
<p class="fig-img"><a id="ch14fig2"></a><img src="f0246-02.jpg" alt="Image" width="554" height="212"/></p>
<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 14-2.</strong> The venture capitalist’s calculation</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The difference between the two views is one of perspective. Since both are estimating future value in their negotiating, neither is right and neither is wrong. The person in the stronger negotiating position usually gets more of what he or she wants. When a company approaches a VC firm for an initial investment, the VC firm is usually in the stronger position. Once the company has proven its ideas, attracted customers, and perhaps even piqued the interest of other VC firms, the founder may be in the stronger negotiating position.</p>

<p class="side-title"><strong>N<small>EGOTIATING</small> <small>WITH</small> C<small>LOUT</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">A company that has attracted the interest of VC firms may be in a strong position to negotiate funding. I once served as the CFO of a start-up technology company that had VC firms aggressively competing for the right to provide the next round of investment capital. The company actually turned away money, effectively rationing the next investment opportunity to those firms the owners felt could be most beneficial to the company’s strategic agenda. Now, <em>that’s</em> negotiating leverage!</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Venture capital firms typically prefer to keep a low profile. Despite that preference, their names are published on lists that are eagerly purchased by entrepreneurs, and they receive hundreds of unsolicited business plans every year, only a small fraction of which are read. It’s generally acknowledged, although seldom stated as an absolute, that a business plan has little chance of receiving serious attention unless it’s been introduced by someone known to the venture capital firm, someone whose opinion they value or at least feel comfortable with. Thus, when it comes to getting attention from these investors, it’s truly a matter of who you know.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Venture capital firms account for only a small portion of all the investment funds poured into new businesses every year. Entrepreneurs who have had VC investors on their boards tell a mixed bag of stories, ranging from masterfully insightful guidance to self-serving decisions designed more to protect the VC investment than to foster the venture’s success. Yet because of their reputation, their ready pools of cash, and their skill in identifying and backing some of the most successful start-ups in memory, nearly every entrepreneur who starts a new venture seeks—or at least covets—the views, the money, and the support of venture capitalists.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>For their part, despite their skill at evaluating new ventures, these investors expect to be wrong most of the time. In fact, traditional wisdom says they will lose money on four of five investments they make, but getting a 10-to-1 return on the fifth makes the efforts worthwhile. If you think about it, would you make your living doing something at which you expect to fail 80 percent of the time? Perhaps that’s why these investors ask for <em>and typically get</em> the valuation leverage they want, even when it seems unfair to the hard-working founder.</p>

<p class="noindentb">Guy Kawasaki, a serial entrepreneur and speaker whose affiliations have included Apple, The Motley Fool, and currently Google, once warned against the following statements that entrepreneurs most commonly use with venture capitalists.</p>
<p class="num-list-t"><span class="none">  </span>1. <strong>Our projections are conservative.</strong> Venture capitalists know that entrepreneurs are optimistic. They won’t take your projections at face value, and they certainly won’t believe “conservative.”</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>2. <strong>ABC [Consulting Firm A] predicts our market will swell to $X by 20XX.</strong> Refrain from giving such numbers. Anybody can predict almost anything.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>3. <strong>XYZ [Huge Company B] is about to sign a sales contract with us.</strong> Entrepreneurs may interpret even a polite rejection as a sign of real interest. VCs know better.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>4. <strong>Key employees will join us as soon as we’re funded.</strong> VCs have telephones and can call those key prospective employees.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>5. <strong>We have first-mover advantage.</strong> Two problems. One, “first-mover advantage” doesn’t matter, not as much as “first to scale.” Two, it’s easy for VCs to check out claims to an advantage.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>6. <strong>Several VCs are already interested.</strong> VCs can check out this claim; if it’s untrue, you lose a lot of credibility.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>7. <strong>MNO [Big Industry Leader C] is too slow to be a threat.</strong> VCs will read in such a statement a lack of market awareness.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>8. <strong>We’re glad the bubble has burst.</strong> OK, so it’s good that investors and entrepreneurs are more rational and realistic, but what sane entrepreneur would be pleased that investment money is harder to obtain?</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>9. <strong>Our patents make our business defensible.</strong> Be realistic: Outside of medical devices and biotechnology, patents mean very little. If an idea is worth money, somebody will copy it.</p>
<p class="num-list-2">10. <strong>All we have to do is get 1 percent of the market.</strong> Leave the worst-case scenario to the VCs. Aim at a figure you consider realistic—and show how you intend to hit it.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev102"><strong>The Initial Public Offering: Heaven or Hell?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">As we’ve already mentioned, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow—the goal of long-term strategies for the entrepreneur who doesn’t want to run a company for the rest of his or her working life—is to sell it for a lot of money and retire to a beach in Tahiti or a golf course in Florida. While there are several ways to do that, selling the company to the investing public through a public offering of stock will typically bring the largest <a id="page_231"></a>return to the sellers. The first time the company sells its shares in the public market is called the <em>initial public offering</em> (<em>IPO</em>). For the classic entrepreneur, the IPO is the ultimate exit strategy.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Initial public offering (IPO)</strong> The first sale of equity in a company to the public, generally in the form of shares of common stock, through an investment banking firm.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Unfortunately for the entrepreneur with beachfront dreams, the IPO isn’t as simple as selling all the shares and walking away, dragging a bag of money. The U.S. government, through the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), long ago decided too many owners were selling a pig in a poke to unwary public investors who found out too late their shares weren’t worth what they paid for them. Today, all the owners, including the professional investors, must remain owners after the IPO, and their fortunes will rise and fall with the public stock price, making everyone interested in the same goal: consistent price appreciation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The SEC aside, the prospect of selling shares over time, along with the likelihood that the company’s continued success will raise the stock price still further, makes the IPO the preferred exit strategy if the company can get it. That’s a big <em>if,</em> because not every company with investor backing makes a big enough splash to interest investment bankers. Remember the 8 in 10 companies that don’t make it? And the 1 in 10 that makes it big? Well, that means that roughly 90 percent of the start-ups that are funded by professional investors are probably not good enough to become IPO stocks—the actual numbers are even more daunting. And of those that do succeed with their IPO, many will deliver less stellar performance than projected in their IPO offering literature. Some of them will sink to market prices below their IPO price, while others will languish with modest returns and sort of disappear into the haze without ever making a significant market impact.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Investment banker</strong> An individual or firm that assists companies in raising money by finding private investors, acquiring companies, or selling a company’s shares in the public market, such as an IPO. All major securities firms (<em>stockbrokers</em> to most of us) also conduct investment banking activities, a situation that has raised charges of conflict of interest in the last few years because they sell stock in companies that they’ve also recommended to their clients. This has led to changes in this segment of the marketplace.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_232"></a>For those reasons, along with the financial crash of 2008, the high cost of an IPO, and the general mood of professional investors since the 2001 tech collapse, IPOs have not been the exit strategy they once were. Today, more successful ventures are sold to a larger company with strategic interests than go public in a splashy debut.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Still, the exhilarating prospect of making it big in the breathtaking IPO game gives company owners hope. Along the way, they are aided by the coaches and advisors, the investors, consultants, accountants, lawyers, and others because everyone wants to play in the big leagues. Every entrepreneur believes it can happen to them—and no one knows for sure, until they take their shot.</p>

<p class="noindent">It would be simple if any company could go public. Unfortunately, it takes more than that—and few succeed. The most likely IPO candidates are companies in industries that are hot—according to the whims of the stock market—and companies that are expected to reach revenues of $100 million or more quickly. As we’ve seen the past few years, those will often be Internet-based companies with truly innovative technology in unfilled niches. Facebook, eBay, Amazon, and Google are all names that come to mind for their dramatic rise and phenomenal valuations. While they all had successful IPOs, each has since purchased numerous smaller companies to broaden their reach, companies owned by entrepreneurs and investors who opted for that type of strategic exit rather than an IPO.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev103"><strong>Strategic Investors: The Path to a Different Party</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s do a little guessing here. There are an awful lot of companies that start up every year. Even if only 5 percent of them stay in business, that’s still a big number. If only 10 percent of these survivors hit it big, that would still be far more than the published statistics of IPO success rates. What happens to all the rest—the companies that succeed but don’t go public?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Well, many of them simply become successful privately owned companies. In fact, many of the most successful U.S. companies are quietly <a id="page_233"></a>owned by private interests. Many privately owned companies had great ideas and grew to be successful but still didn’t get there by using venture capital money. Many of them were started by entrepreneurs who had the same dream of a rich exit, like their IPO counterparts. Do they just give up and go home? Not by a long shot. Many of these companies go the other route—teaming up with an existing company that appreciates the value of their ideas and hopes to improve its own business through the success of the start-up.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Such companies often become <em>strategic investors</em> by investing in promising start-ups in return for both stock ownership and the first opportunity to receive the benefit of the start-ups’ innovations. These strategic investors may want the rights to sell the venture’s products as their own, to incorporate the venture’s products into their own, or to purchase the start-up and merge it into their business. That benefit is mutual, if it’s done right:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The venture gets access to the technical expertise of the larger company to help it solve issues.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The investor gets innovation it likely is not nimble enough to create by itself, except at an exorbitant cost.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The venture gets a partner with more marketing muscle than it would have alone, perhaps even getting its products into the strategic partner’s sales force offerings, producing a built-in distribution channel.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The investor gets to offer new products, perhaps including state-of-the-art technology that it didn’t know how to develop or wasn’t prepared to take the risk of developing.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The investor may be able to purchase this company and its products and innovation for a fraction of the cost of buying a more established company, if it even could find an established company willing to be acquired.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev104"><strong>Acquisition: The Strategic Exit</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Suppose you’re the founder/CEO of a company that didn’t get angel funding, didn’t get VC funding, didn’t get strategic partner funding, but <em>still</em> managed to build a company that’s making it on its own. The company is self-sufficient in terms of cash flow and modestly profitable, but <a id="page_234"></a>lacks sufficient resources to take full advantage of its market position. Let’s further assume that your company isn’t an IPO candidate because it’s not exciting enough to sizzle the pages of a prospectus. Finally, let’s suppose the company was built on some innovative technology that’s likely to be seriously challenged in a few years. This is a fair assumption because technology moves pretty fast these days, particularly if a company has demonstrated there’s a ready, profitable market for it. Or, let’s suppose the owners are in their 50s or early 60s. They managed to survive the bruising recession of 2008–2010 and have firmly decided they don’t want to go through that again. I believe there are thousands of business owners who will exit their companies in the next 5–10 years with exactly that mindset.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Many founders look at the prospect of running such a company for 5–10 more years to make only an adequate living and say, “No more!” Others are ready to go the distance, but fearful of their chances against bigger, well-financed competitors, and they’re worried that they might lose it all. Their options? Fold the tent and go home, hang on and hope for the best, or find a big brother to protect the company from intruders.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In financial circles, finding a big brother doesn’t mean going to some charity event or calling long-lost relatives. It means finding a large company that wants to acquire the young company and is perhaps willing to pay off the owners/managers after a transition period or to offer them jobs running their company from inside the newly acquired big brother.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Without a strategic partner, the management team must find a prospective buyer and convince the company that acquiring the venture would be a good idea. The venture owner(s) might do that by hiring an investment banker or by initiating their own search, but the idea is to find a friendly 800-pound gorilla they know and like before an 800-pounder they don’t know or don’t like knocks on the door. The young company would be looking for:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The possibility of making a friendly deal at a better price for the owners’ stock than might be available later, in more challenging times;</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Jobs for the venture’s employees, including the CEO if desired, which might not be so easy later with an unfriendly buyer, especially if the CEO resisted their overtures; and</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_235"></a><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The ability to pick the time to look for a deal, when the venture looks its best, prospects are looking good, there’s cash in the bank, and the venture isn’t facing an immediate threat.</p>
<p class="indenttb"><span class="none">  </span>By contrast, the potential acquirer has a different list, which might include:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Maintaining or increasing a growth rate that stockholders have come to expect, particularly if the acquisition is in a growth area expected to become “hot” soon;</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Protecting itself from inroads into its market by younger companies with the kind of innovative products it lacks;</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Putting excess plant capacity to work building products for the young company at a favorable incremental cost because it’s already paying for the capacity;</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Putting excess cash to work earning a better long-term return than it can earn sitting in the bank; or</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Developing complementary products (e.g., lawn tools for a lawnmower company or computer printers for a computer company).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>There are some distinct differences in an acquisition under these circumstances and the kind of deal that might be made with a strategic investor. For example, a company that acquires a venture rather than investing in it early on doesn’t bear the added cost <em>or risk</em> of nurturing the young company to self-sufficiency. For coming late to the party, however, it must likely pay more for the company because there’s less risk and a higher certainty of a good ROI. The selling stockholders are generally entitled to a better price because they rode out the rough times and carried all the risk.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Of course, like any acquisition transaction, the outcome is the result of negotiation more than calculation and logic. Each party tries to present his or her case and convince the other to accept it, or something close to it. For this reason, CEOs wishing to buy or sell typically enlist the services of negotiating experts, such as investment bankers, mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) consultants, or lawyers skilled in deal making.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch14lev105"><a id="page_236"></a><strong>Manager’s Checklist for <a href="ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a></strong></h3>
<p class="check-i-1"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Angel investors are often the first step for entrepreneurs to obtain outside financing, after they have exhausted their “friends and family” resources. Angels typically accept the highest risk and make the smaller investments that very early-stage companies need to get started.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Venture capital investors are often the second stage for the entrepreneur. VCs invest larger amounts, but typically ask for larger stakes in the company and expect it to make more progress before they invest. That means greater actual sales, among other things.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Valuation of a company when it’s not yet earning a profit—or even bringing in revenues—is a challenging task that’s crucial to the company wanting investment capital, yet the lack of real data typically reduces the decision to a negotiation rather than a calculation.</p>
<p class="check-i-2"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> While the initial public offering is often the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, few companies realize the dream. Many more are acquired by strategic partners, sold once they have matured, or simply run under private ownership until the owners retire.</p>
