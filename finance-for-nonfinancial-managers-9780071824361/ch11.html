<h2 class="h2"><strong>Business Planning: Creating the Future You Want, Step-by-Step</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>I</strong></span></span>n my consulting business I speak to a lot of managers, from for-profit businesses to nonprofit organizations. They are busier today than ever before, it seems, and we find more frequent use of planning. Yet despite the apparent trend toward greater use of business planning methods, a common refrain from some harried business managers is: “We’re too busy running our company to do formal business planning.” Even start-up CEOs, who are creating a whole new company, are prone to add: “If potential investors want to look at something, we’ll do a plan for them, but we certainly don’t need one ourselves. We’re clear about where we’re going, and we don’t have the interest or the spare time to write it out on paper.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Thus begins still another chapter in the myths of business planning. <a href="ch11.html#ch11fig1">Figure 11-1</a> includes some of my personal favorites.</p>

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 11-1.</strong> Myths of business planning debunked</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev74"><strong>Why Take Time to Plan?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Every organization with a goal in mind develops a plan to get there. Every manager with a job to do develops a plan to get his or her daily work done. Yet, for the most part, these plans are informal. Often people only carry them around in their minds and detail them as needed, improvising and modifying along the way.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Most people don’t think of themselves as planners, yet they plan every day, formally or informally. We plan pretty much for the best reasons: because planning helps us to reach goals, whether the goals relate to getting our daily work done, laying out the family vacation, or financing our retirement. <em>We plan when we don’t know how to get where we want to go.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>People who regularly plan in their personal lives sometimes resist planning when their company announces the annual budget or the quarterly business plan review. And yet the plans serve the same purpose: to reach desired goals. The company version is different, of course. For one thing, it’s usually more formal and more detailed, for several reasons, all related to executing the plan:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Execution requires the coordinated efforts of many people.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_161"></a><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Execution consumes substantial, expensive resources.</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The plan involves multiple, often interlocking and related goals and tasks that must be achieved.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>For much the same reasons, a business plan should be a <em>written</em> plan. Putting a plan in writing enables us to gain several important benefits for our planning efforts:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  <strong>Clarity.</strong> What must be done and the steps to get there are clarified. We’re less likely to forget something or to have to hastily redirect our efforts to include a missing task if we’ve written down the tasks ahead of time. When we carry plans in our heads, funny things sometimes happen. We can change the plan in mid-thought in case it looks more difficult to reach than we originally thought and no one will know. We can rationalize with ourselves that 75 percent is as good as 100 percent, and no one will hold us accountable for our questionable adjustment of the metric. When a plan is written, it’s crystal clear what the goal was—75 percent or 100 percent or whatever—because it’s there on the page in black and white.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  <strong>Roadmap.</strong> If you can remember the last time you tried to find a new street address without a map, you may recall making a few wrong turns, stopping to ask directions, retracing your steps, and generally proceeding more slowly because you weren’t sure where you were going. A plan tells you which turns to take and which ones to avoid, and you know the route ahead of time because you’ve thought it through before the journey began. Fewer wrong turns means less time wasted, less money spent, and better results with the same resources.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  <strong>Communication.</strong> We have a means to communicate consistently and easily the goals we want to achieve to everyone who we believe helps us meet those goals, such as staff, bosses, customers, and suppliers. Clearly communicated goals—without ambiguity or confusion or the distraction of today’s emergencies—are more likely to receive support from all those who can help us get there.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  <strong>Empowerment.</strong> In any challenging endeavor, we face goals that seem difficult if not impossible to reach. They may not be impossible, but the idea of getting that far beyond where we are today can seem that <a id="page_162"></a>way—and when something seems impossible, that can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. By writing down our plans, along with all the critical steps to get there, we effectively break the goals into small steps. We can then look at each step and clearly see the possibility—even the probability—of achieving it. Thus we give ourselves permission to believe the goal is achievable. That permission does powerful things in our minds, shifting what is often the most significant obstacle to success: our own belief systems.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev75"><strong>Strategic Planning versus Operational Planning</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">There are business plans—and then there are business plans. Let’s begin by distinguishing between the two principal types of business plans: strategic plans and operational (or operating) plans. The two look different and are written in a different style, because they are intended for different audiences. Every marketing manager knows that a brochure, to be effective, must be customized to its audience. The same holds true for a business plan, whichever type it is. It should always be written for its intended purpose and directed to its intended reader.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterms.jpg" alt="Image" width="96" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Business plan</strong> The generic name for a plan written for a business. It generally includes a statement of the plan’s objective, the period it covers, and the goals to be achieved by the new business. How those ideas are expressed depends on the type of plan.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Strategic plan</strong> A type of business plan designed to define the vision and mission of a business, its strategy and long-term objectives, and the key details important to the strategic reader. The plan is typically intended to drive the company’s strategy for several years, and serves as the basis for the company’s operating plan.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Operating plan</strong> A detailed description of what the company will do to pursue the objectives of its strategic plan for the next operating period, usually one year. The operating plan contains enough detail that the company’s operating managers can use it to guide their daily and monthly activities.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Financing plan</strong> A special version of a strategic plan written to attract outside financial resources to the company, usually intended for equity investors, but sometimes written for lenders as well. This version emphasizes the amount of money needed, how it will be used, and how the investors will receive a return on their money. The plan may also discuss, or at least touch on, the plans for an exit strategy (more on this in <a href="ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a>).</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_163"></a>A <em>strategic plan</em> is usually more than a statement of goals. It’s a statement of corporate purpose, a request for support, and a call to action. In other words, the plan’s purpose usually includes an emotional appeal of some kind. Therefore, the form as well as the content should be aimed at capturing that support.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The purpose of a strategic plan is to guide the organization’s direction: to define its grand purpose, what it wants to achieve, and the general strategies it will use to get there. The plan might include the definition of the company’s market, its product categories, and the ways in which it will change the buyers’ lives in its intended market. The plan might also define the organization’s long-range goals and provide a segue to the shorter-term and more detailed activities that are laid out in the operational plans.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The strategic plan typically doesn’t contain a lot of details about implementation. Rather, it talks in global terms about the business the company is engaged in, the strategies the company will pursue, the benefits that will be achieved when the implementation is complete and how that will enable the company to move closer to achieving its fundamental purpose.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The <em>operating plan,</em> by contrast, is primarily intended as a short-term playbook (usually one year) for the executive managers and staff who have responsibility for carrying out the plan. It contains details they need to do their work—milestones, action steps, detailed budgets, timetables, and so on. Such a plan would make dull reading for the analyst who’s studying the company’s strategic direction. But its contents are essential to the manager charged with delivering the assigned sales goal, upgrading the computer network to the next software version, or finding out how much money is budgeted to build the new trade show booth or hire the new engineer.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s look at the principal elements of a business plan, and examine how each would be treated in a strategic plan vs. an operating plan.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev76"><a id="page_164"></a><strong>Vision and Mission: The Starting Point</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The vision and mission are intended to express the organization’s grand purpose, the point from which everything else should emerge. There are a thousand definitions for these terms—and at least that many opinions about whether either, or both, or a “purpose statement” instead, should be the foundation for a plan. Rather than add my opinion to the pack, let me tell you what they bring to a plan. Then you decide whether a plan has adequately included them.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Vision of the Future</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Any organization starts with some sort of grand purpose. Typically that arises when the founder looks around and sees that a worthwhile need is going unfilled. Abraham Lincoln had the vision of a great nation undivided by slavery. Henry Ford had the vision of a world in which almost any family could afford to own and drive an automobile. Bill Gates had the vision of a computer in every home. Steve Jobs had a vision of technology products that were both attractive and easy to use. In each case, the vision was of the world as they thought it should be, not as it was then. I suspect their visions seemed beyond the imagination of those around them at the time. But then, their visions <em>were</em> beyond the imagination of normal people of their time. Their fervor—and probably more than a few carefully laid plans—may explain why they were able to convert those visions into reality. So, let’s look at my definition of <em>vision</em> as I’ve just described it: <em>Vision is the world as you define it, rearranged as you would like to see it.</em></p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Mission: The Path to the Holy Grail</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Once you understand the definition of vision, the definition of mission is easier to grasp: <em>Mission is the role of the organization in achieving the vision.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>If the vision is grand enough, it may not be something one organization can achieve by itself (although it may be able to, as the organizations led by the visionaries above did). As a rule, first the vision is defined, then the organization does what it can to get there.</p>

<div class="sidebar-ash">

<p class="image-r"><a id="page_165"></a><img src="forexample.jpg" alt="Image" width="96" height="96"/></p>
<p class="side-title"><strong>V<small>ISION</small> <small>AND</small> M<small>ISSION</small> <small>IN</small> A<small>CTION</small>: A C<small>ASE</small> S<small>TUDY</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">I had a client some years ago who defined his world as the dental industry in Southern California. His company’s vision was for a world (the aforementioned industry) in which hazardous waste materials from dental work would not contribute to environmental pollution. For a variety of reasons, that world didn’t exist when his company was formed. Novocain, mercury, and other byproducts of dental services did not have the regulatory controls and enforcement that more visibly hazardous materials did. It was a worthwhile purpose that was not being effectively addressed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>He went about building a company and a service that brought cost- effective hazardous materials collection and proper disposal within reach of every dentist in his world. Within a few years his company was the dominant provider of this service throughout Southern California. He may not have achieved his mission completely, but he made great progress in that direction and ultimately sold his company to a larger company that wanted to use his methodology to expand its own presence in that market. The buyer, in effect, took over the mission the founder had envisioned. And, yes, he was an excellent planner as well as a visionary entrepreneur. Today he helps other entrepreneurs achieve their visions.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev77"><strong>Strategy: Setting Direction</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Once a company has decided its mission, the questions likely arise: Now what? How do we start? What direction do we move in? In most situations these questions require a deeper look at the organization before management can develop effective answers. That deeper look often takes the form of examining the organization’s internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as the external opportunities and threats that exist in its world or its marketplace. The analysis technique for this exploration is called a <em>SWOT analysis,</em> SWOT being the acronym for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (<a href="ch11.html#ch11fig2">Figure 11-2</a>). By looking at each of these objectively, the company can learn a great deal about its likelihood of success and what it must build on or, alternatively, overcome to enhance that likelihood.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>SWOT analysis</strong> The analytical process of determining the significant internal and external advantages an organization possesses, and the internal and external obstacles it must overcome to develop an effective strategy for achieving its goals.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><em>Strategy</em> is essentially deciding what direction the decision makers take as they begin to pursue their mission, and strategy is decided when the decision makers make an assumption about what it will take to overcome the vision’s most significant obstacles and what assets the organization has at its disposal. Abraham Lincoln had to react to the creation of the Confederate States of America; he decided the best strategy was military force because he felt the Confederate states wouldn’t be convinced to rejoin the United States otherwise. Henry Ford saw how few people could afford the luxury cars that were the only ones being built at the time; he decided he had to find a way to build a car that could be sold for $400 to average income earners. Bill Gates perceived that people’s learning curve and resistance to technology were the prime obstacles to adopting personal computers; his strategy was to develop software that had a consistent look and feel and that would enable people to more easily use those computers. Steve Jobs saw the same obstacles Bill Gates saw, but his strategy went well beyond the Microsoft concept by emphasizing consumer appeal and ease of use while maintaining tight control of the <a id="page_167"></a>hardware platform on which Apple’s software ran. Together Gates and Jobs transformed the global concept of personal computing in a wave of technology enhancement that’s still unfolding today.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In each case, the decision maker assessed the market, identified the obstacles, and crafted a strategy to address those obstacles. That sets the pattern for setting specific goals and objectives, which is a primary purpose of a business plan.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev78"><strong>Long-Term Goals: The Path to the Mission</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentb">The business plan elements we’ve discussed up to now have been global, intangible, and largely nonspecific. Once we move into setting goals, specificity is essential to success. In fact, setting effective goals requires attention to both the goal’s content and structure. This is best demonstrated by an acronym that many of us have heard in one form or another at planning seminars and workshops. The acronym is SMART, and we use it to arrive at SMART goals, the kind that get results. Here are the characteristics of SMART goals:</p>
<p class="list-box-11"><span class="none">      </span><strong>Specific.</strong> The goal is identified clearly, by how much and when. How much of the desired result constitutes success—$50,000 or five offices or 15 new employees? By when will the goal be achieved—a specific date or a specific length of time after beginning? This specificity is needed to ensure everyone knows whether the goal has been achieved. I suggest to workshop audiences that the goal is specific enough if your 16-year-old son or daughter would recognize it.</p>
<p class="list-box-11"><span class="none">      </span><strong>Measurable.</strong> You must be able to measure the success with available data. Setting a goal to capture 20 percent of the market by year-end is specific enough, but if there is no industry data available to measure who has what share of market, it’s a meaningless goal. Set goals for which you can get reasonably reliable information. Bonus: It precludes your staffers dismissing the goal as smoke because they know it can’t be measured.</p>
<p class="list-box-11"><span class="none">      </span><strong>Achievable.</strong> The goal must be challenging but still achievable. More to the point, it must be perceived as achievable. If the staff believes the goal is unattainable, they’ll give up on it from Day 1, and any efforts to reach the goal will be wasted. Goals should be set so they are a <a id="page_168"></a>stretch beyond what exists, so people recognize the need to exert effort to get there. Yet people should have a reasonable belief that if they shoot for it, they can get there.</p>
<p class="list-box-11"><span class="none">      </span><strong>Relevant.</strong> The goal should be relevant to the organization’s vision, mission, and strategy. That’s the whole point, after all: to get to the vision. Occasionally a manager gets excited about an opportunity that doesn’t relate to the mission and devotes resources to achieve what sounds like a great idea. The problem? It takes resources and focus away from the job of the organization—fulfilling the mission.</p>
<p class="list-box-11"><span class="none">      </span><strong>Trackable.</strong> This adds substance to our goal-setting methodology. A goal is trackable if you can establish milestones to track progress toward the goal. This enables you to monitor progress and avoid unpleasant surprises at the 11th hour, when your staff “discovers” they won’t make it by tomorrow, as was committed. A trackable goal might be an annual sales goal of $120,000. Seasonal adjustments aside, you should expect to bring in $10,000 a month and ask questions if any month falls much short of that. Thus you will know how the team is doing well before the fourth quarter, and can take action to redirect resources, if necessary, to ensure that the goal is met.</p>

<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev79"><strong>Short-Term Goals and Milestones: The Operating Plan</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Once the grand design of the strategic plan has been laid out, the company needs a detailed plan for its managers and employees to follow. While the strategic plan typically covers a period of three to five years, its implementation is usually thought of in terms of one-year periods, each of which is guided by an annual operating plan.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The year covered by an operating plan is typically the company’s operating or fiscal year. The plan lays out the company’s goals for the coming year, and the support those tasked with individual goals and action items will need for the company to meet its overall goals. Further, <a id="page_169"></a>for a plan to be effective, it must be trusted, meaning that employees must believe that the plan was drafted with reasonable foresight, knowledge, awareness, and thoroughness. Otherwise it will be second-guessed at every step, with the likely result that every step will cost more in resources than planned, and some more challenging goals won’t be met because people don’t trust they can get to where the plan says they can.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The operating plan and the related budget (discussed in <a href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</a>) constitute the playbook for action during a company’s operating year. The operating plan is usually the joint effort of every department, coordinated by the Finance and/or Planning Department. Each department head will have participated in the planning process by writing the goals his or her department will achieve during the plan year. The operating plan may outline the goals and targets of each major unit within the company, the P&amp;L budget for the year, and a budget of planned capital expenditures. In addition, subsections of the plan may be devoted to individual departments, so that each has its own roadmap to follow. Information included in the departmental subsections, in addition to goals, might include staffing, existing and planned additions, and the department’s budget for the year. A suggested outline for an operating plan appears in <a href="ch11.html#ch11fig3">Figure 11-3</a>. This is the document that goal-driven incentive plans typically use as a measuring stick.</p>
<div class="group">

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 11-3.</strong> Outline of an operating plan for a business (continued on next page)</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The layout of this outline and the order of its contents aren’t as important as having all the bases covered. In other words, the plan should cover all these topic areas in a way that’s logical to everyone in the organization, regardless of where in the plan each topic appears. I have found that organizing the plan by department makes it easier for each department to incorporate its contribution, as well as to refer to its part of the plan during implementation or assessment of progress. The following sections will help you to understand what should be covered in each part of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">It helps to begin by reminding readers of the operating plan’s relationship to the grand design—the overriding purpose of the company—and the direction the company is moving to fulfill that grand design. Knowing <a id="page_171"></a>that Wonder Widget’s stated purpose was to become the dominant provider of high-quality widgets in the western United States puts in perspective the specific goals that the company wants to achieve during the coming year and enables every manager to buy in anew to that strategy as he or she begins work on the current year’s goals. Whether a company decides to recite the entire vision, mission, and strategy at the beginning of the document or simply give a summary, as suggested here, is less important than the effort to reinforce the grand purpose in a way that generates renewed enthusiasm for the long-term plan.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The overview should also contain the company’s key goals for the year and the key challenges and opportunities it faces, to keep everyone focused on the company’s direction and to keep them from getting too wrapped up in their own department’s agenda at the expense of the team objectives.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>The Production Plan: Getting the Product Ready to Sell</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Whether the company makes or buys its products or provides a service, some activities must be initiated and satisfactorily completed to have something to sell. Goals might include reaching monthly production or service levels that support sales forecasts, improving machine output or maintenance downtime or setup times, or moving to just-in-time ordering to lower average inventory levels. The plan should lay out these goals, along with the timetable, staffing, and financial resources needed to achieve them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The plan should also identify the production challenges that must be met to reach the goals, and the steps the organization plans to take to meet those challenges. This information will have been identified during the SWOT analysis mentioned earlier. These challenges might include heavy recent turnover of several skilled supervisors, the age or condition of the machines in the plant, pricing pressures from suppliers who demand price adjustments to provide just-in-time shipping, and so on. If the plan doesn’t specify the challenges and deal with them effectively, it will quickly be seen as irrelevant by employees who find their paths blocked by obstacles they can’t control.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_172"></a><strong>Marketing and Sales Plan: Generating Interest and Making the Sale</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Given the availability of the product or service, the company’s marketing and sales organization (or organizations, if they are separately managed) must determine how it will interest the company’s potential customers and then sell enough products to reach the sales goals. Representative goals here might include hiring and training more salespeople, launching a targeted marketing campaign to raise brand awareness, introducing five new products during the year, opening and staffing three sales offices, or reducing customer complaints about product delivered vs. promised.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Challenges to be addressed might include a large competitor with a similar product, an aging product that hasn’t kept up with changing market demands, strong competition for quality salespeople that keeps compensation high and candidate quality low, or pricing pressures caused by a bad economy. These challenges might be addressed by simply lowering the revenue forecast, but that indirect approach sidesteps the more effective method of approaching each obstacle directly and identifying the steps to mitigate the potential damage.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>R&amp;D/Product Development Plan: Bringing New Ideas to Market</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Some companies provide services that drive their sales, and continuing sales depend on delivering reliable levels of service at reasonable prices. Other companies sell products they buy from others (usually based on the desires of their customers) and don’t create or manufacture any products. But many other companies sell proprietary products, that is, products they have developed and that they make or over which they maintain manufacturing control.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Such products have typically been developed by these companies at some cost in time and money. That cost must be identified and reflected in their planning, along with the expected fruits of that effort in terms of new research advances, technological breakthroughs, new products developed and brought to market, and so on. For these companies, an R&amp;D section of the operating plan is essential to ensure resources are allocated to these activities and to clearly set forth the expected results from use of those resources.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Any bus company at that time had to address these challenges in its operating plan to have any chance of achieving its stated goals for revenue and gross margin. For example, a company might have offered its customers extra services that delivered high value in the customers’ eyes without raising costs too much, thus lowering price resistance from customers. A company might also sharpen its search for better financing and hold buses a few months longer than normal, thus lowering bus replacement cost pressures. Or, a company might shop for insurance coverage more aggressively and raise deductibles to lower insurance premiums. Perhaps the best solution would be a combination of all these options. Clearly industry-wide pressures of this magnitude tend to squeeze out the weaker players, typically those with less able management teams.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>How well did the industry do? While it’s hard to associate outcomes with specific actions or inactions over the years, the American Bus Association reported that the number of motorcoach companies in the United States and Canada shrank by 30 percent between 2007–2010—another difficult economic period.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Plans might identify the new products they intend to bring to market during the coming year, based on projected outcome of development efforts. For a drug company, results might include a key drug moving from basic testing to first clinical trials. While the company is still years from marketing this product, it can still plan for and measure results in <a id="page_174"></a>terms of progress along the development path and through the lengthy regulatory process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>A company engaged in R&amp;D faces numerous and substantial challenges. For one thing, it’s often impossible to know how long it will take to reach a given research goal or how much money it will cost. Unknown events or testing failures or breakthroughs can dramatically affect the process. Most drug company research projects never produce a product that can be marketed and sold profitably, an outcome that cannot be known when the research on a specific product begins. These companies must find a way to allocate resources, manage expectations against results, and be prepared for good news and bad news along the way.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Financial Plan: The Budget</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>financial plan</em> is the financial report card, the section of the plan that shows the financial results of all the work outlined in the plan. It shows the revenues the company expects to achieve if the sales goals are met and the expenses to be incurred to support the sales and other goals, if everything goes according to plan. This key document is covered in depth in <a href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev80"><strong>Manager’s Checklist for <a href="ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</a></strong></h3>
<p class="check-i-1"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> The term <em>business plan</em> is a generic label. It’s important to determine the purpose of the plan, its intended readership, and what’s expected of its readers in order to know the kind and depth of material it should contain.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> We all plan some of our activities, but the more complex the business activities we must manage, the more important it is to have a plan to guide us. A plan needed to manage a business activity should be in writing to ensure it provides clarity, a roadmap to the desired result, consistent communication of what is to be done, and the means to empower those who will carry it out.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Goals must be crafted with care to be effective in driving performance. SMART goals encompass the key characteristics that make them most likely to succeed—or at least most likely to produce a <a id="page_175"></a>clear, organization-wide understanding of what was expected and what was delivered.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Strategic plans are typically long-term (three to five years) and broad in their description of the goals to be achieved. Operating plans are usually short-term (one year) and more detailed in their description of the work. Strategic plans guide the operating plans. Operating plans guide the day-to-day activities that get work done.</p>
<p class="check-i-2"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> A realistic operating plan should define the goals the company wants each department to achieve. The plan should also identify the challenges the company must overcome to reach the goals and how they will be met if the plan is to be both believable and achievable.<a id="page_176"></a></p>
