<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>S</strong></span></span>ince writing the first edition of this book, I brought two more books into circulation. I’ve come to realize that I enjoy writing and that it comes easily to me. Countless newsletters and published articles attest to the fact that I seem to have lots to say on the subject of financial communications. That’s a good thing for an author. But I also learned early in the process that I couldn’t do it alone unless I wanted to self-publish and fill my garage with books, something that doesn’t hold much appeal for me. Thanks to John Woods of CWL Publishing Enterprises and two other publishers along the way, I never had to go that route.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>I’m particularly indebted to Alexander Auerbach, founder of a successful Los Angeles–based public relations and marketing services consultancy, for his talented assistance in editing the final draft of this book and to Daniel Feiman and Ed Story, two of my gifted associates who provided valuable assistance with several key chapters of the first edition. Their generous contributions are reflected in this version as well. Also, a thank you goes out to Dave Berkus, noted entrepreneur and serial investor who gave me carte blanche to quote his proven thinking for entrepreneurs. His wisdom appears in the chapters on cash flow and entrepreneurship. Over the life of the book, I’ve gotten many comments and suggestions from readers, business associates, and instructors who have used the book for classes in entrepreneurial finance. I have considered every comment as I crafted this edition, and I hope I’ve done justice <a id="page_x"></a>to all your input. It is deeply appreciated.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Finally, all those efforts would have been in vain if my beloved partner, Karen Dellosso, hadn’t been willing to let me stretch already-long workdays into even longer workdays as this book came into existence—twice.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Thank you all. I really appreciate you.</p>
