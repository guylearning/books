<h2 class="h2"><strong>The Structure and Interrelationship of Financial Statements</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>E</strong></span></span>very corporation has, from the moment it’s formed, an indefinite life under the law. The corporate laws of every state grant a corporation the right to perpetual existence to enable management to take strategic actions that will have a long-term impact on the company’s survival and growth. These include making long-term contracts and issuing certificates of ownership (stock) that don’t expire.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>But perpetual existence is only a legal concept. In reality, most companies follow a pattern of birth, rapid growth, slowing growth, plateau or no growth, decline, and demise (<a href="ch02.html#ch02fig1">Figure 2-1</a>). That is, unless they’ve learned how to evolve, i.e., adapt, to a changing world.</p>

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 2-1.</strong> The lifecycle of a company</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Companies that react effectively to change can minimize or even avoid decline and demise, but those are natural phases in the lifecycle. There are companies whose names are as familiar to you as they were to your grandparents; these are the ones that learned how to extend their lifecycle.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Unfortunately, most new companies follow the more typical pattern, most eventually closing their doors. If you were even a moderate investor in the dot-com era of the ’90s, you likely are able to rattle off a half-dozen names of once-promising companies that no longer exist (hopefully not because you owned their stock). Outside the technology industry there were also many companies that didn’t have the right stuff to remain independent and have fallen. The list continued to grow as the 21st century got under way. Household names that are rapidly fading into history include TWA, Worldcom, Enron, Arthur Andersen, and more recently, Tower Records, Circuit City, Sharper Image, and Borders Bookstores. The economic upheavals of the last 15 years or so have proven fatal to companies that had been around for decades. That includes a few financial names that seemed long-lived: Lehman Brothers, Countrywide, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, and of course the biggest scam in history, Madoff Investment Securities.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Many more companies that didn’t actually close their doors were acquired at fire sale prices by other companies and lost their separate existence, becoming merely a unit of a larger, more successful company. You can still see names like Texaco, RCA, Merrill Lynch, and Chrysler, but none of these companies exist today as a standalone entity.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Yet good companies continue to grow through successive periods of renewal, rebirth, and resurgence. Multiple examples of these can be found in names we recognize—IBM, Intel, and Apple, to name a few.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>A few excellent companies, by contrast, seem to be forever resurgent. While they may occasionally pause in their progress, they never seem to actually go into decline. Examples include General Electric, Southwest Airlines, Walmart, and Microsoft.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>A major similarity among these companies, perhaps the overriding one, is their ability to react to change. Change impacts a company’s ability to capture and hold its market, grow its business, profitably sell its products, and ultimately, survive and prosper (<a href="ch02.html#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>).</p>

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 2-2.</strong> The lifecycle of a well-managed company</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>My 25-plus years of consulting experience tell me that the tendency of most business activity is to find those processes that seem to work and then repeat them over and over as long as they continue to function. This is considered efficient and is a proven technique for maximizing profitability. However, every company or department manager must learn to differentiate between those business processes that must evolve, like research and development, and those that should remain stable. <em>Financial accounting is one of those processes that needs a high degree of stability</em>. Financial statements are a key source of information managers need to help them decide how to keep their companies evolving, re-inventing themselves, and remaining profitable in a rapidly changing world.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev7"><strong>Tracking a Company’s Lifecycle</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">As we have learned in the past few years, financial accounting needs more stability and less creative accounting than it has experienced to give it adequate credibility in the eyes of the users of financial information. Managers rely on financial reports prepared from accounting data to guide their business decisions. Investors rely on those same reports to guide their investment decisions. Government relies on many of the same reports to collect taxes, enforce our laws, and protect the company’s investors, employees, and customers. Thus the recorders of a company’s financial data carry a heavy responsibility to provide information that is, in a word, ARTistic—<em>Accurate, Relevant,</em> and <em>Timely</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>While accounting rules change to respond to changing business <a id="page_16"></a>models and new types of business transactions, those changes must reflect the responsibility accounting has to all its constituents: to produce information that they can rely on. As you will read, that isn’t always easy, but it’s every bit as important as it sounds. That’s why accounting as a business process should remain fairly <em>stable,</em> evolving only after careful consideration of the implications of reporting transactions differently than they might have been recorded previously. Remember that a major use of financial information is to make comparisons with similar information from earlier periods. If the accounting methods are different, the comparisons and, hence, conclusions may be flawed. As we have learned from the reports of financial shenanigans in recent years, it is too easy to create incorrect conclusions if the rules allow too much flexibility.</p>

<p class="side-title"><strong>ART<small>ISTIC</small> F<small>INANCIAL</small> R<small>EPORTS</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Unlike the “creative” financial reporting adopted by formerly major companies in the news in the past few years, ARTistic reports are the cornerstone of sound reporting; that is, financial information that’s:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  <strong>Accurate</strong>—Prepared with sufficient accuracy to be relied upon, and yet without requiring such a high degree of accuracy as to make them too expensive or too time-consuming to produce. This balance concept in financial reporting is called <em>materiality</em>. Generally, a transaction is considered to be material if the financial report reader would be likely to be influenced by knowing it. Materiality is usually evaluated in terms of the amount of money involved, relative to the whole.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  <strong>Relevant</strong>—Presented in a format that is useful to those who must use the information. A detailed listing of transactions with no totals or explanation might be accurate, but it’s of little use to anyone and, so, likely irrelevant for most business purposes.</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  <strong>Timely</strong>—Produced in time to be useful to those who need it. A totally accurate, relevant report that comes out many months late is of little value because managers likely will have had to make decisions before it was available.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In addition to stability, one of the key characteristics of the accounting process is <em>repeatability</em>. The accounting process achieves the highest degree of accuracy, relevance, and timeliness by use of its repetitive methodologies, enabling accountants to process the most data at the <a id="page_18"></a>least cost. The most common repetitive process in the accounting world is the monthly closing cycle. A company goes through the traditional monthly routine of “closing the books” to see how the company is doing in terms of its financial objectives, including profitability. That accounting cycle, and the information value it produces, is perhaps best demonstrated by <em>not</em> going to a football game.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev8"><strong>Accounting Is Like a Football Game on Your DVR</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Imagine yourself at home on a November Saturday evening. You’re looking forward to watching the football game that was played earlier in the day while you were doing chores. You digitally recorded the entire game and now you want to watch it and enjoy all the nuances of the action. You bring up the recording, settle back into your easy chair, and press Play.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In the very first big play of the game, your team’s quarterback takes the snap, steps back, and deftly throws the ball to a receiver 30 yards down-field. Just as the receiver reaches out to catch the ball, a defender’s hands block him and prevent the catch. You’re out of your seat in an instant, demanding the referee call interference and penalize the defender. Then you realize you can replay the action and see if there was any illegal pushing. You stop the video, go back to the moment of the play, and freeze the action so you can study it in detail. Even though the action didn’t stop, your recorder gives you the ability to pause and review any segment of the play action. Notice on the stopped video that the ball is frozen in mid-air and the players reaching for it are similarly frozen in time, feet high off the ground. You can see exactly where everything was at that moment—the players, the referee, and even the players in the background who were part of the action elsewhere on the field. In a real sense, it’s a snapshot of a game moment, a single instant in the 60 minutes of playing time.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Grudgingly satisfied that there was no interference, you restart the recording. Your team marches down the field, nicely mixing running and passing, until it has a first down on the visitor’s 8-yard line. In a well-executed running play, your team’s running back takes the ball and charges through the pack, only to be tackled at the goal line. Did he get over or not? The referee says no. Once again, you stop the recording, back up a few seconds, and review. This time you’re sure the ref is blind, because <a id="page_19"></a>you’ve made your own analysis of the data and are convinced the score should now be 6–0 in favor of your team.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Keep in mind that the game was played hours earlier, before you got a chance to watch it, and it went on continuously for three hours (counting pileups, commercials, and halftime). Despite your ability to stop the recording whenever you chose, in reality, the game never stopped. Your tools enabled you to look back and analyze the action in as much depth as you wanted, because your DVR had recorded all the details of the game. In picture form, that might look like <a href="ch02.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>.</p>
<div class="group">

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 2-3.</strong> Flow of the action</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>As you can see in <a href="ch02.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>, the action flows throughout the recording, but your periodic Pause commands to your remote resulted in an artificial stop in the action. When you press Play, the action resumes exactly where it left off, as if the Pause had never happened. Each vertical bar on the chart represents the freeze frame actions you took in an otherwise continuous flow of activity.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Now consider the financial transactions that occur every day in your company. Employees arrive, do their work, and get paid. The company buys products and services, pays for them, adds its value to what it buys, and delivers the products or services to its customers. Then it bills those customers and collects what they owe, enabling it to pay its own bills. This flow of activity is continuous every business day, all year long, for as many years as the company is in business. Once a month the Finance Department produces a report that starts on the first day of each month <a id="page_20"></a>and ends on the last day of that month. The accountants have found a way to stop the action for their purposes, even though it never stops in reality, so they could report on the results for each period of “the game.” The accountants succeeded because they, too, “recorded” the action. Think of the accounting books as an Accounting Transaction Recorder, or ATR. Now we might change the labels of <a href="ch02.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a> to those shown in <a href="ch02.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a> and see some similarities between the two recordings.</p>
<div class="group">

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 2-4.</strong> Flow of the financial action</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>As you can see, Record starts when the business starts and the Pause status is captured in the company’s balance sheet at the end of each period. Then there is a continuous flow of action, captured in the company’s income statement and its statement of cash flow. The action never stops, but periodically, usually once a month, the accountants press Pause on their recorders so they can analyze in detail the progress the company has made. They then give you an income statement and statement of cash flow that total the changes that happened during the month-long activity. You also get a balance sheet, which shows where everything was on the last day of the month, when the accountants pressed Pause: how much the company was owed by customers, how much cash it had in the bank, how much it owed to creditors at that moment, and more. Much like the paused play in the football game, the balance sheet is a snapshot of a single instant in the life of the company.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>What’s the big difference here? For the football game, you had to do your own analysis, using only your eyesight and your knowledge of the <a id="page_22"></a>game. Of course, you can get extra value from hearing the announcers, particularly the ex-coach-turned-announcer, because they always describe things that their experience and keen eyes picked up that you didn’t. The better you know the game, of course, the more useful information you can get from what the announcer says, although most will miss the nuances.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In your company, by comparison, the accountants likely have in-depth experience and analytical tools to look at the data from different angles, and they can prepare reports that tell you and others what the analysis reveals. Because you are using the financial Record and Replay devices—the ATR—you can study those reports at your leisure and even ask for clarification without losing a minute of company “game time.” You could read the reports yourself without their help, but you probably couldn’t produce the reports without their help, because you don’t have an ATR.</p>

<p class="noindent">The more you know about the game of football, the more valuable the insights you get from the game commentary, even though most viewers will miss most of the nuances. Not surprising, the analogy carries over to financial reports. The more familiar you are with the concepts of accounting and finance, the more of the “hidden” information you’ll get from your company’s financial reports and the less time it will take you to get it, even though others may miss the point entirely.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev9"><strong>The Chart of Accounts: A Collection of Buckets</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you’ve seen a chart of accounts, you probably wondered why the accountants hold this list in such high regard. You might hear comments like, “It’s not in the chart of accounts. We don’t know where to put it.” Or, “We can’t process your invoice without an account number.” While to many nonfinancial managers, these phrases might seem intended primarily to retard the progress of commerce, that’s really not their purpose—honest!</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The entire recording process of any accounting system requires a basic organization of data; for example, the payment of vendor invoices can be summarized and clearly reported as to what was done, why it was done, and what organization(s) benefited from those expenditures. That basic organization is called a <em>chart of accounts</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Chart of accounts</strong> A systematic listing of all the general ledger account names (and associated numbers) used by a company, arranged in the order in which they normally appear in financial statements—customarily Assets, Liabilities, Owners’ Equity (or Stockholders’ Equity), Revenue, and Expenses. The purpose of the chart of accounts is to enable the classification of transactions into groups of similar transactions to make reporting and analysis easier and more productive.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>You might think of the organizing system for your company’s accounting data as a collection of buckets, or accounts, with each bucket holding a particular kind of data. There is probably a bucket for each asset the company owns and a bucket for each debt the company owes. There is also a bucket for each product or service the company sells and one for each type of expense the company might incur as it sells its products or services. A company might have 200 or more buckets to hold all the transaction data about each asset and liability and each income and expense category. Some companies have many more in order to capture data even more precisely in the interest of greater accuracy.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The chart of accounts is an organized, comprehensive list of all those buckets. Each bucket, in turn, is labeled with its appropriate account number and arranged by the kind of data it holds, so that accountants can quickly find the right bucket to store a new piece of data about a particular asset or liability. These buckets are then arranged and rearranged during the accounting process and their contents are counted and checked—usually monthly—to produce reports that summarize the data they contain.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Take a quick look at the abbreviated chart of accounts in <a href="ch02.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>, to get an idea of what it might look like in a typical company. We discuss and define the major categories in the chart of accounts in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="ch04.html#ch04">4</a>, when we talk about the basic financial statements. You don’t need to memorize what the chart of accounts looks like, as long as you remember its importance in categorizing raw accounting data into useful information.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Notice that accountants use a numbering convention to differentiate assets from liabilities and income from expenses. There are endless variations on account numbering, but all follow some similar kind of arrangement to facilitate transaction coding. Notice that some accounts are indented and numbered to indicate they are subordinate to others. These subaccounts provide a breakdown of the larger categories into smaller categories to save time and readily provide more detail later when users are analyzing the data.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>If you have spending authority in your company, you may be asked to approve invoices from vendors. In some companies, that approval process includes assigning an account number to the invoice to advise the accountants into which bucket the transaction belongs. In other companies, a purchase order must be issued with all the account information that Accounting needs to process vendor invoices. If you are blessed to be in the latter group, you may never need to know anything more about the chart of accounts except that it exists.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev10"><strong>The General Ledger: Balancing the Buckets</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You’ve probably heard the term <em>general ledger</em> and might even have joked that this must be the guy who secretly runs Accounting and issues all those reports no one can read. (Well, maybe not.) As mentioned in <a href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>, the original general ledger was a large book with ruled pages into which all the transactions were carefully recorded by hand. It’s now likely to be a computer file, but it still carries the traditional name, and it’s still the place where all accounting transactions ultimately are recorded. It’s also the data source for most of the basic financial statements that companies produce.</p>
<div class="group">
<p class="fig-img"><a id="ch02fig6"></a><a id="page_25"></a><img src="f0042-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="500" height="316"/></p>
<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 2-6.</strong> The balance sheet balances!</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Think of the general ledger as an old-fashioned weight scale that’s always in balance because its keepers always add or subtract equal and offsetting amounts to each side whenever they weigh something. All the buckets that appear in the chart of accounts are arranged in one or the other of the scales, depending on the account number on the bucket.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>As each transaction occurs and is entered into the accounting system, the accountants refer to the chart of accounts to find the name and location of the correct bucket(s). Then they add to each bucket the appropriate amount that represents the financial effect of that transaction. When they add something to a bucket on the Asset side, such as a new delivery truck, they must finish the job in one of two ways to rebalance the scale. Either they must take away something of equal value from a bucket on the Asset side, such as the cash that was paid for the truck, or they must add something to a bucket on the Liability side, like the bank loan for the money that was borrowed to purchase the truck.</p>

<p class="noindent">One relationship is fundamental to financial accounting: Total assets must <em>always</em> equal the sum of total liabilities and total stockholders’ equity. Thus, if a company is able to conduct its financial affairs in such a way that it can add assets without adding an equal amount of liabilities, it effectively increases the relative weight (i.e., value) of the company’s ownership. Remember: The two sides must always balance, according to the formula that is always true under the rules of accounting:</p>
<p class="center"><strong>Total assets – Total liabilities = Stockholders’ equity</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Now, what this means to you is this: The simplest way to increase Assets without increasing Liabilities by an equal amount is to make a profit.</p>

<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Stockholders’ equity</strong> The amount that would theoretically remain if all the assets were sold and all the liabilities were paid off, at the values shown in the company’s general ledger. Stockholders’ equity typically comprises the total amount invested in the company by its owners plus accumulated profits of the business since inception.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Stockholders’ equity is not a reflection of the dollar amount that would be realized if the company were liquidated, however, because liquidation almost always produces a cash return that differs from the originally recorded amounts. For example, liquidated equipment would probably be sold at a sharp discount, sometimes at a fraction of the amount recorded in the general ledger. Thus, stockholders’ equity is a guide—a reasonable approximation—rather than an accurate measure of the owners’ relative share of the business. Other terms that mean the same include <em>owners’ equity</em> (often used for a sole proprietorship or partnership), <em>net worth, capital accounts, equity,</em> and <em>surplus</em> (not-for-profit organizations).</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The result of these entries is that the scale is still in balance—<em>and the company has a self-checking system to ensure the entire transaction has been recorded.</em> Assuming the accountants have picked the right account buckets, the details of each transaction are correctly captured and available for review at any time. Codes attached to each piece of data enable <a id="page_27"></a>the accountants to connect all the data pieces that were added to the scale as part of that particular entry, should the entire transaction need to be reconstructed in the future. For example, those various codes enable Accounting to know what was bought, from whom, for how much, on what date, and where it will appear in the financial reports.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev11"><strong>Accrual Accounting: Say What?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The accounting rules outlined in GAAP (remember <a href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>?) require most companies to keep their accounting records on what is called the <em>accrual basis</em>. In our everyday financial activities, such as when we balance our checkbook, we operate on a cash basis, meaning a transaction is recorded only when cash changes hands. Because <em>cash basis accounting</em> does not reflect debts that we owe others or others owe us, it’s not considered indicative of economic reality. That’s why most companies use accrual basis accounting. The only exceptions are very small businesses and some not-for-profit organizations.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Here’s an example of accrual basis accounting: When the Sales Department obtains an order from one of your customers and the product is shipped to the customer, a sale has been consummated and it is recorded. This transaction will appear on the income statement even if not a single dollar has passed from the customer to your company, because the customer has an open account with the company. The transaction is recorded on one side by increasing Sales and on the other side by increasing Accounts Receivable, the amount due from your customer.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Later, perhaps the following month, your customer pays the amount owed, and your company receives the cash. That transaction will not appear on the income statement. It was already recorded as income when the sale was made. Under accrual accounting rules, the sale itself is considered the income-producing event. The act of collecting the money is just converting one asset—accounts receivable—into another asset—cash. That’s a new transaction, but not one that produces a profit, since the dollar amount owed by the customer is replaced by an equal dollar amount of cash received from the customer.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>This example demonstrates the essence of accrual basis accounting. Transactions are recorded when an economic event is deemed to have occurred. A sale is an economic event because a binding agreement has been reached: Your customer agreed to accept the merchandise and pay for it in due course, and your company shipped the merchandise based on your customer’s promise to pay. That is an economic event: an offer made, accepted, and fulfilled.</p>

<p class="noindent">In almost any discussion of accounting, you’ll hear talk of <em>debits</em> and <em>credits</em>. Those elusive terms exemplify the technical jargon of accounting and (in my opinion) are not terribly useful for nonaccountants. You don’t really need to know that debits increase Assets and decrease Liabilities, or that credits do the reverse. You only need to know the nature of the transactions that accomplish those things, and that has been well covered in this book. If you understand the idea of accrual accounting and the “buckets” discussed above, you don’t need to worry about the debits and credits (unless you’re applying for a job in Accounting, in which case this is the wrong book to be reading).</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The customer’s payment is another economic event. It’s related to the first, but it’s nevertheless a new event. The customer might have chosen to delay payment or return the merchandise, but instead chose to pay for it. The second economic event doesn’t affect Sales. However, it does affect the balance in the customer’s accounts payable account, and it increases your company’s cash receipts. So when this transaction is recorded, Accounts Receivable and Cash are the affected accounts. This transaction, although not shown on the income statement, is included in the statement of cash flow, which documents cash transactions other than those affecting income and expenses. If this explanation isn’t clear, more information is presented in <a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="ch06.html#ch06">6</a>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Having tossed around the names of financial reports that we haven’t yet defined, let’s take a moment to clarify those terms and add the next piece to this puzzle, called Finance, before we move on to the next chapter.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev12"><strong>The Principal Financial Statements Defined</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Three primary financial statement formats appear in every company’s annual report as well as in most internal monthly financial reports. We mentioned them briefly during the football game analogy, but I want to reintroduce them here, because in the next few chapters we discuss their contents and appearance in considerable detail.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_29"></a><strong>The Balance Sheet</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>balance sheet</em> is the report that shows the company’s financial condition as of a particular date—usually the end of a month, a quarter, or a year. The report shows all the company’s assets, typically valued at the cost to acquire them. In some cases assets are shown at whichever is lower, the actual cost or the current market value, if accounting rules indicate a permanent reduction in value below cost has occurred. Similarly, the company’s liabilities are shown at either the amount(s) borrowed or owed. Some of these numbers are shown as exact amounts, and some may be estimates based on the best available information. The dollar difference between the reported values of the assets and the liabilities belongs to the owners of the company—it’s their stockholders’ equity interest. The balance sheet is discussed in detail in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<p class="noindentb"><strong>Balance sheet</strong> An itemized statement that summarizes a company’s financial condition, with all its assets and liabilities, as of a given date, usually the end of a month, a quarter, or a year.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>The Income Statement</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>income statement</em> recaps all a company’s activities intended to produce a profit. It shows the amount of sales, all the costs incurred in making those sales, and all the overhead costs incurred in running the company so it’s able to deliver on its promises to customers. In this book we call it the income statement, but your company may call it something else. All companies that keep their accounting records on the accrual method produce a statement similar to this. The income statement is discussed in <a href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>.</p>

<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindentb"><strong>Income statement</strong> An accounting of revenue, expenses, and profit for a given accounting period, usually a month, a quarter, or a year. Also known as <em>profit and loss</em> (<em>P&amp;L</em>) <em>statement, statement of income and expenses,</em> and <em>operating statement.</em></p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Statement of Cash Flow</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The income statement shows activities that were recorded using accrual basis accounting. However, companies that keep their books using <a id="page_30"></a>accrual accounting still will have transactions that don’t appear on the income statement, usually involving the exchange of cash. Let’s say your company borrows money from the bank and puts the money into its checking account for later use. No income is created here, and no expense yet—until the loan interest begins to accumulate. So how do you get this on the books? And how do you report it? The answer is the <em>statement of cash flow</em>. This report shows the effect of all transactions that involve or influence cash but don’t appear on the income statement. Going back to our football game analogy, you’ll recall we noted about <a href="ch02.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a> that these two statements together would contain every transaction that occurs in a company between any two balance sheet dates. You learn more about the statement of cash flow in <a href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

<h4 class="h4"><strong>Other Report Formats</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">A wide variety of other reports may accompany the basic statements in a financial report or may be prepared separately for special purposes. These often are more valuable in managing specific areas of the company’s finances than the basic statements. Examples include reports on accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory. We don’t have room in this book to cover all the possibilities, but we mention some of them in later chapters as they relate to the subject.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>It’s sufficient here to recognize that computerized accounting data today is almost universally maintained in database formats that give the Accounting Department the flexibility to produce report data in a wide variety of formats. If you feel a critical need for information that you’re not getting from reports, visit the controller or the company bookkeeper; you might be surprised at how easily a responsive financial analyst can produce exactly what you need.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev13"><a id="page_31"></a><strong>Manager’s Checklist for <a href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a></strong></h3>
<p class="check-i-1"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Financial reports must be reasonably accurate, formatted in a relevant way, and delivered in timely fashion in order to help managers make decisions about the company. For each ARTistic attribute, there is a trade-off between the degree of perfection and the cost of achieving it.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> The chart of accounts is an organized list of all the kinds of transactions that typically occur, so that transaction totals can be meaningfully grouped, summarized, and reported on financial statements.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> The balance sheet is a snapshot of a company’s financial condition at a specific point in time, while the income statement and the statement of cash flow tabulate all the transactions that occurred during a period of time, i.e., between any two balance sheet dates.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Accounting transactions are recorded in a balanced way, with each transaction affecting the scales equally to ensure that the transaction has been recorded completely and correctly. If the scales are always in balance, the balance sheet will always be in balance as well.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Assets always equal the sum of liabilities and stockholders’ equity. Put another way: Assets minus liabilities always equals stockholders’ equity (owners’ equity). As a result, increasing assets without increasing liabilities by a like amount increases equity. This is achieved in its simplest form when the company makes a profit.</p>
<p class="check-i-2"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> The accrual method of accounting is the standard for nearly all companies. Under the accrual method, transactions are recorded when an economic event has occurred, such as when a customer buys a product or the company purchases supplies. The results of these transactions generally are recorded as soon as the commitment to enter into the transaction has been consummated, not when cash is received or paid for the commitment, which might be much later.</p>
