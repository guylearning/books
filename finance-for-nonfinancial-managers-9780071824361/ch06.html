<h2 class="h2"><strong>The Statement of Cash Flow: Tracking the King</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>I</strong></span></span>n the preceding chapters we examined the income statement in some detail. We noted its importance in measuring the organization’s performance and its familiarity as the financial statement most readily recognized and understood by nonfinancial folks. We should also recognize three shortcomings of the income statement as the sole report card of financial operations:</p>
<p class="num-list-t"><span class="none">  </span>1. It doesn’t report on all transactions that occur in a company unless they have an immediate impact on profit or loss. Many transactions without such immediate profit and loss impact can be for big dollars, such as buying equipment for the plant or borrowing money from the bank.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>2. It doesn’t explain why the net profit never appears as an actual improvement to the company’s bank balance.</p>
<p class="num-list-b"><span class="none">  </span>3. It doesn’t give growing companies a tool to manage their scarcest resource: cash to finance growth.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>That’s why we suggested in <a href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a> that you resist voting for the income statement as the most important financial report until you hear from the unheralded, often unseen, frequently unread, but resoundingly relevant <em>Statement of Cash Flow</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Most have heard that adage: Cash is king! Yet for many business professionals, that most often means making sure there’s money in the bank <a id="page_82"></a>or in the cash register or in their pockets. However, if there’s one thing that consulting professionals, lenders, and turnaround experts all agree on, it’s that the cash a company has on hand is a <em>trailing indicator</em> of its financial condition. In other words, by the time the status of a company’s liquidity is reflected in the bank account, the cause of the problem is already history and there’s not much managers can do about it. Company executives often focus on the symptom, fixing the immediate cash shortage, instead of finding and fixing the original cause of the problem—product pricing, operating efficiency, credit granting policy, or a host of other possible causes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>So the trick for every manager is to be continually aware of where the cash is coming from and where it’s going, both for historical evaluation and for future planning. How best to do that? Well, there are two choices: They can pore over their cash journals and bank statements and prepare an exhaustive analysis of their bank account transactions each month <em>or</em> they can prepare an automated <em>financial report</em> that summarizes those transactions and identifies the general causes of increases and decreases. Hmm … Which one should we choose?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s go for the financial report, shall we? And to make our job easier, let’s pick one that shows us all the major reasons net profit didn’t produce an identical amount of cash going into the bank. Huh? There couldn’t possibly be a single report that contains that much information about something as critical as cash, could there? Wouldn’t such a report be on the desk of every manager who has any kind of financial responsibility in his or her company?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce to you the Statement of Cash Flow.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>OK, maybe that’s a bit dramatic. But the reality isn’t too far afield from my playful musing. Most small businesses, for example, don’t routinely prepare a statement of cash flow as part of their monthly financial reporting, even though almost all accounting software systems can produce one on demand. In larger companies with a well-staffed Accounting Department, the report is often produced but infrequently read, except by the accountants and the CFO, whose job it is to act on it (and perhaps tell others what it says).</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev40"><a id="page_83"></a><strong>Beginning Where the Income Statement Ends</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">There are two basic formats for presenting the cash flow statement; in this book we use the indirect presentation method. It’s the same format that appears in all published financial reports of public companies and that’s readily produced by most accounting software. It’s also the format that produces the most useful information with the least paper. And the good news is that it begins where the income statement ends—literally—because its intent is to answer that important question raised earlier: What’s the difference between net profit and net cash flow?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Answering that question gets us into defining the differences and then presenting them in a way that nonfinancial readers can understand. A few words about format are helpful here before we take a look at a report.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Accountants have presented cash flow in two ways traditionally, the direct method and the indirect method.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The direct method is what you’d probably prepare if you were analyzing your checking account to see where the money came from and where it went. It would look something like <a href="ch06.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>.</p>
<div class="group">
<p class="fig-img"><a id="ch06fig1"></a><img src="f0101-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="546" height="378"/></p>
<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 6-1.</strong> Statement of cash receipts and disbursements</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_84"></a>As you can see from <a href="ch06.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>, the report shows cash coming in and cash going out. Well, isn’t that what it’s supposed to show? Yes. But it can and should show much more. Notice that there’s no mention of net income on this report or an attempt to explain the difference between net income and net cash flow—a key difference for anyone managing a company. Nor does the report show inflows and outflows grouped by purpose or cause. There’s more information that can be communicated as well. A variation of the statement of cash receipts and disbursements was once called the statement of sources and applications of funds, but it was only marginally more useful and is rarely seen these days.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>That’s why the indirect method was developed, why it’s the standard report format used in published annual reports, and why it’s the format that nearly all accounting software programs produce when you ask for a cash flow statement. It’s a bit harder to understand initially, but the potential for meaningful analysis is far greater. That’s why we discuss only the indirect method format in this chapter and what each line tells you. If you find you need to read over this section a few times to get the concepts working for you, it’s time well spent.</p>

<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterms.jpg" alt="Image" width="96" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Direct method of presenting cash flow</strong> Shows the major categories of cash receipts and cash payments, summarizing cash inflows and outflows. This method may be more understandable for people without accounting training; however, it lacks analysis value.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Indirect method of presenting cash flow</strong> Begins with net income and adjusts for changes in account balances that affect cash but are not included in the calculation of net income. Each adjustment either increases or decreases the net change in cash, which is the report’s objective. This is today’s standard method because it shows a line-by-line reconciliation between reported net income and net change in cash, and because that valuable information doesn’t appear on other financial reports.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s look at the monthly statement of cash flow from the Wonder Widget Company’s monthly statement of cash flow (<a href="ch06.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>). Notice that the first entry on the page is net income, which tells us that this statement picks up where the income statement left off. The idea is that net income is presumed to equal the net cash flow, except for the adjustments <a id="page_85"></a>that make up the details of this statement. Notice also that the entries are divided into three sections—Operations, Investing, and Financing—the three principal areas of cash activity for virtually all companies.</p>

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 6-2.</strong> Statement of cash flow (indirect method)</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s explore Wonder Widget’s activities and see what we can learn from its cash flow reporting. I’ve slipped in a couple transactions that our early-stage company might not be able to pull off yet, like long-term borrowing, but this gives us more opportunity to explain the kinds of entries we might see on a more fully developed company’s report. I’ve also added a comment to each line on the report to help you understand the nature of the transactions that created the need for the adjustment. We comment on those further in the respective sections that follow.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev41"><a id="page_86"></a><strong>Cash from Operations: Running the Business</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Operations</em> is the process of running the company, with all the related cash flows such as buying and selling goods and services, manufacturing, and paying employees. In the simplest situations involving only the day-to-day operations, this is the conversion of net income from operations into net cash flow from operations. You’ll see how that happens as this chapter unfolds.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Net Income</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The first line is net income because, as we’ve noted, a prime objective of this report is to show the differences between net income and net cash flow. The net income number is the same amount that appears at the bottom of the income statement. Next we list as adjustments to net income all the operating items that increased or decreased cash in ways that were not included in the calculation of net income (e.g., loans).</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Add Back Depreciation</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Do you remember the way equipment and other assets are charged to expense? Depreciation—the gradual charging of an item’s cost to expense over its useful life, as discussed in <a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>—is recorded each month after the asset is put into use. No cash changes hands as a result of those depreciation entries, because the cash was all paid out when the asset was bought. So the monthly charge for depreciation expense must be removed from reported net income, in effect <em>increasing</em> income in <a href="ch06.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a> by the $7,500 that had no effect on cash. (We call these <em>non-cash items</em>.) So depreciation expense is always added back to net income, usually as the first adjustment on this report.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Increase in Accounts Receivable</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Some of the customer balances (accounts receivable) that Wonder Widget had at the beginning of the month were collected during the month and some were not. Similarly, some of the sales made during the month were paid for by their customers, although typically payments for credit sales on 30-day terms would not have come in yet (retail cash businesses aside, of course). At the end of the month the company had some of the opening customer balances still outstanding, as well as some of the new balances.</p>
<p class="indentb"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_87"></a>Look at this another way. If all the customer balances at the beginning of the month and all sales during the month were collected in cash, there would be no ending accounts receivable, and the month’s cash receipts from customers would equal their opening balances plus the month’s sales. However, since there were outstanding balances at the end of the month, the amount of cash Wonder Widget took in must be reduced by those outstanding balances that will hopefully be paid later. Here it is as a formula:</p>
<p class="center">Beginning accounts receivable + Sales – Ending accounts receivable = Cash collections</p>
<p class="indenttb"><span class="none">  </span>But remember that the month’s sales are included in net income. This line item on the report shows how much of the period’s sales must be removed from the cash flow calculation because the cash for them hasn’t yet been received. If we rearrange the formula, it now looks like this:</p>
<p class="center">Sales + (Beginning accounts receivable – Ending accounts receivable) = Cash collections</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="none">  </span>So the difference between sales (100 percent of which are included in net income) and cash collections is the difference between accounts receivable at the beginning of the month and accounts receivable at the end of the month. Since the company sold more to its customers during the month than it collected, this adjustment is a negative amount, showing less cash was collected than what was sold. In other words, Wonder Widget <em>loaned</em> its customers $125,600 in cash by not collecting as much as it sold, so cash was reduced as a result.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Decrease in Prepaid Expenses</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">In our <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a> discussion of Prepaid Expenses we talked about the up-front payment for items that have an extended period of value, such as insurance. We noted that such payments are expensed over the period for which they provide value by periodic charges to net income, <em>charges that do not require additional payment of cash</em>. Each monthly charge to income for a portion of prepaid expense is a noncash charge, just like depreciation, and the company would add it back to net income in the same fashion, getting one step closer to the actual cash flow for the month.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><a id="page_88"></a><img src="caution.jpg" alt="Image" width="80" height="104"/></p>
<p class="side-title"><strong>A N<small>EGATIVE</small> A<small>DJUSTMENT FOR</small> A<small>CCOUNTS</small> R<small>ECEIVABLE</small> I<small>S A</small> R<small>ED</small> F<small>LAG</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">This small gem of information (customer balances outstanding) is hugely important if cash management is important to the company, because the amount the company in effect loaned to customers means that cash has to come from somewhere—it will stay out of the company’s cash balance until those accounts receivable balances are collected. If this increase in customer balances happens every month, the balance sheet could be growing and sales could be growing, but the company could be slowly slipping into insolvency, as Wonder Widget was in <a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Now, having accounts receivable grow, i.e., lending more money to the company’s customers, may be all right if sales grow as much or more, because a growing company that sells on credit—and does reasonable cash flow planning—should normally expect its accounts receivable to grow as its sales grow. But if sales are flat or down from the prior month and the company <em>still</em> loaned more money to its customers than it collected, that would mean its collection effort was inadequate. Its customers are using up the company’s working capital by delaying payment. Remember: Any increase in receivable balances greater than the monthly increase in sales is an additional interest-free loan to your customers. That will sink a company that doesn’t plan ahead.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Of course, the reverse is also true. In the same month the company might also pay an insurance premium for the coming year, thus making a big cash disbursement that would not be charged to expense—the opposite of the amortization adjustment above. In this case the adjustment would be negative, showing cash paid out that was not reported as an expense on the income statement.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>This line on the statement of cash flow is the net of these two types of adjustments. The decrease of $1,500 in <a href="ch06.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a> indicates that the noncash expense for amortization was larger than any amounts paid out for new prepaid items. So we add back the $1,500 as additional cash generated by the month’s activity.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Decrease in Inventory</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">You may be able to visualize this one without too much effort. If Wonder Widget purchased only the merchandise it sold during the month—the way Dell traditionally has done it—it would need to keep essentially no <a id="page_89"></a>inventory of goods on hand. It would buy only what it sold and sell everything it bought. Since that doesn’t work for most companies—and even Dell has some inventory—the change in inventory balances works on the cash account just like accounts receivable.</p>
<p class="indentb"><span class="none">  </span>Remember: The income statement includes the cost of all inventory sold during the month. The inventory adjustment on the statement of cash flow is needed <em>only</em> if the beginning inventory balance changed by the end of the month, indicating the company purchased inventory it didn’t sell during the month or sold inventory it didn’t have to purchase that month. As a formula, it would look like this:</p>
<p class="center">Beginning inventory + Cost of inventory purchased – Cost of inventory sold = Ending inventory</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="none">  </span>Or, if we rearrange the pieces a bit:</p>
<p class="center">(Cost of inventory sold – Cost of inventory purchased) = (Beginning inventory – Ending inventory)</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="none">  </span>And here’s one more look to get us where we want to go:</p>
<p class="center">(Beginning inventory – Ending inventory) = Increase in cash from liquidating inventory</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="none">  </span>The cash flow adjustment would be positive if the inventory balance was reduced during the month, indicating the company sold some goods out of beginning inventories and did not spend cash to replace them. This latter situation is what happened to Wonder Widget in the month shown. Conversely, the cash flow adjustment must <em>deduct</em> the cash cost of any inventory added to beginning inventory balances, meaning that the company bought more than it sold and inventory increased during the month, costing cash.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="caution.jpg" alt="Image" width="80" height="104"/></p>
<p class="side-title"><strong>I<small>NVENTORY</small> U<small>P</small>, S<small>ALES</small> N<small>OT</small>: A<small>NOTHER</small> R<small>ED</small> F<small>LAG FOR</small> C<small>ASH</small>!</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">A company adds inventory when it anticipates growing sales. Toy companies add inventory all year long for their big holiday selling season. But that costs cash—and inventory doesn’t convert to cash for a long time. Inventory must first become sales and accounts receivable before it becomes cash again. If inventory is increasing and sales forecasts aren’t growing accordingly, the company may be investing too much in goods that might never become cash. Liquidating old inventory is a poor way to raise cash—and it almost always results in a loss on the income statement.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_90"></a><strong>Increase in Accounts Payable</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The last operating item in the operating section of the report is accounts payable, amounts owed to creditors of all kinds. Since payment of liabilities requires the use of cash, any change in a company’s accounts payable means it has either used cash to pay some trade obligations (reducing accounts payable) or it increased the amount owed to creditors, thus borrowing money from them for use in the company.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>If a company raises cash by letting its creditor balances build, as Wonder Widget apparently did, thus increasing cash by $28,500, the result is a higher payables balance at the end of the month than at the beginning. The resulting cash flow adjustment is upward, showing cash coming in from creditors.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>However, if the company had ended the month with lower accounts payable than at the beginning, it would have effectively paid more money to its creditors than it borrowed from them through new purchases; in that case the cash flow adjustment would have been a deduction, showing an outflow of cash. Again, the change in accounts payable from the beginning to the end of the month is a quick way to calculate the amount of this adjustment, whether it increased or decreased cash in the company’s bank account.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev42"><strong>Cash for Investing: Building the Business</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Investing in and growing the business involves plowing back some of the cash generated by the business or bringing in capital from outside the business. Growth investment can include buying equipment for expansion, buying or selling investment assets, and other activities that enable the company to increase its resources for doing more business.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Capital Expenditures</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The most common description of capital expenditures is the amount spent for equipment used in the business. Expenditures for such assets require cash, but are not charged to income. (Refer to the discussion of depreciation above and in <a href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>.) Therefore the cash paid out for them is shown here as a reduction in cash. In our example, Wonder Widget paid $45,000 cash for equipment to use in its operations. Since the asset purchase is not an expense—that is, not included in the calculation of net income—its cash cost appears as a capital expenditure in the investing section of the report. Money spent for equipment is always considered an investment in the company, building its physical resources.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><a id="page_91"></a><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Capital expenditures</strong> Amounts spent for all fixed assets (as discussed in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>) that are not charged to expenses when purchased, but are recorded on the company’s balance sheet—that is, they’re <em>capitalized</em>—and then depreciated over the time they are used by the business. Capital expenditures are often identified by the shorthand CapEx.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>But maybe the company borrowed the money to pay for the equipment instead of writing a check. What then? Remember that purchasing equipment and borrowing money are two separate management decisions, so they’re treated separately in the report details. Although the company may have obtained the purchase cash by borrowing it, the purchase is still a commitment of cash. So it appears here as a deduction. Had the company financed the purchase, an offsetting item would appear in the statement’s Financing section, discussed below. Notice there’s no comparable influx of cash in the Financing section, so it’s unlikely that Wonder Widget borrowed money for this purchase. Rather, it used its available cash. Another example of management not paying attention to its cash needs.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Investments Sold</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes a company invests excess cash so that the money works for the company until needed in operations. Such investments are typically short-term commitments, such as bank certificates of deposit or marketable securities, which the company sells when it needs the cash. Emerging companies with successful public offerings of their stock (more on this in <a href="ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a>) often raise a lot of cash before they’re ready to use it; short-term investments are a way to earn income from those otherwise idle cash balances. Since Wonder Widget had only long-term investments on its balance sheet (<a href="ch03.html#ch03fig1a">Figure 3-1</a>), we assume management decided to sell some of them to raise cash.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_92"></a>When an investment is purchased, it appears as a cash expenditure in this section as a reduction in cash. When an investment is sold, as has apparently occurred in our example, the sale’s net proceeds are an additional source of cash. Wonder Widget raised $24,000 in this fashion, perhaps to partially pay for its equipment purchase.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Other Examples of Investment Items</strong></h4>
<p class="noindentb">There are other kinds of transactions that would appear on this statement if the company engaged in them. Notable examples include:</p>
<p class="list-box-1a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Acquiring or selling off other companies, subsidiaries, or business segments;</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Purchasing real estate for future expansion or selling unneeded real estate; and</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Buying or selling long-term investment assets.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev43"><strong>Cash from Financing: Capitalizing the Business</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Financing</em> is an activity intended to raise money to pay for operations and investments when operations alone don’t generate sufficient cash. When a company is expanding and needs more cash than it can raise through profitable operations and it lacks salable investments, outside financing is an option. Selling stock in the company to investors or borrowing money from banks or other lenders are ways to help finance the company that would appear in this section. Conversely, buying back the company’s stock or repaying borrowed money are also financing activities, but they reduce cash by retiring the vehicles by which capital was brought in previously.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Increase in Bank Debt</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Wonder Widget has succeeded in borrowing $10,500 from a bank, perhaps all it could get to help with the equipment purchase. We can’t tell the purpose of the loan by looking only at this report, but we can see that it resulted in an increase in cash during the month.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Of course, if we look further into the company books, we could see if the company actually borrowed more than $10,500 and used some of that cash increase to repay other loans, which would reduce cash. This line <a id="page_93"></a>shows the net result of all such transactions, although the report might just as easily have shown two lines: one for new money borrowed (an increase in cash) and another line for loan repayments (a decrease in cash).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>How do we find out what actually happened? A quick look at the Wonder Widget balance sheet (see <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>) reveals it does have short-term bank loans on the books, so it likely made loan payments, which would appear in this section of the cash flow statement. If we were to prepare a longer form of this report, we might expand it to show both sides of these transactions on separate lines, thus providing additional information to readers.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Net Reduction in Long-Term Debt</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">This item is similar to bank loans in the way it flows through the report; actually, it probably <em>is</em> bank loans. Additional borrowings increase cash; repayments reduce cash. The separate classification and different labels reflect the fact that long-term debt is shown on a different line of the balance sheet because of its different characteristics—long-term vs. short-term. This helps the reader associate the two statements when reading the company’s financial report. In this particular month, Wonder Widget made a $4,000 payment on its long-term debt and apparently borrowed no more money in this category, so the net change is a cash reduction of $4,000. We can’t be certain of this from the short format in our example, but logic tells us that a net change in cash of so modest a payment amount was unlikely to include anything other than a monthly payment. A quick look at the balance sheet in our example and the one from the prior month (if we had it) would likely confirm our notion that no new debt was incurred.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Dividends Paid to Stockholders</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">A profitable company’s board of directors often elects to pay a distribution of profits to its owners. A corporation makes that distribution in the form of a dividend on the shares of stock held by its stockholders, as in our example. Since such distributions are almost always in cash and they are not expenses that would appear on the income statement, this is the only report on which such payments are likely to appear.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><a id="page_94"></a><img src="mistakeproofing.jpg" alt="Image" width="126" height="91"/></p>
<p class="side-title"><strong>D<small>IVIDENDS</small> C<small>OME FROM</small> P<small>ROFITS</small>, N<small>OT</small> L<small>OSSES</small>!</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">While Wonder Widget technically had enough profits to pay a dividend, you’d have to ask yourself why a new company without strong cash flow would do so—and that would be a good question to ask Wonder Widget’s board of directors, in view of its modest cash position. Since the directors are probably also the owners, this could have been a self-serving act that wasn’t in the company’s best interests but in the interests of the owners personally.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Such questionable judgments are sometimes made in privately owned companies run by their owners, for whom personal cash flow problems often impact their companies. As we’ve seen in the past few years, even the largest companies can fall victim to the bad judgment of their top executives/stockholders. While this decision was not necessarily bad, you closely examine the reasons whenever dividends are not clearly coming from excess profits that the company doesn’t need.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>

<h4 class="h4"><strong>Net Cash Flow (Drain)</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Net Cash Flow</em> is the sum of all the entries preceding it. It should always equal the actual change in the cash balance from the beginning to the end of the report. That’s why the final step in this statement is to add this line to the beginning cash balance—which should have appeared on the prior month’s balance sheet—to arrive at a grand total that’s the new ending cash balance. That new balance should also appear on the balance sheet as of the same date, as it does in <a href="ch03.html#ch03fig1a">Figure 3-1</a>. In this fashion the statement of cash flow is tied into the balance sheet just as it was tied into the income statement from the first line. This final step ensures that every transaction has been accounted for on one or the other of these reports.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev44"><strong>Using This Report Effectively</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You’ve seen how each of a company’s major activities can significantly affect cash flow. The statement of cash flow is intended to make those effects apparent, so that readers of a company’s financial reports can identify and address negative impacts on cash and preserve positive impacts on cash. This report can be longer or shorter than the example used here, but it should include an adjustment for every balance sheet item that changed, except for cash itself.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_95"></a>You cannot understand a company’s cash flow activities without this report or, alternatively, a substantial detailed analysis of its cash records. Sometimes this report indicates that even more detailed analysis is needed to answer questions that it raises, but it’s better to raise those questions than to be unaware of them. In <a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a> we look at additional ways this information can be presented to give us an even better understanding of cash flow without the hard work.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev45"><strong>Manager’s Checklist for <a href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a></strong></h3>
<p class="check-i-1"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> The statement of cash flow fills a critical information need: It analyzes all the reasons net income didn’t produce an equal increase in cash in the bank. The statement of cash flow is by far the easiest way to get that information.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Cash is needed to finance customer purchases on credit. If accounts receivable grows faster than sales, it’s a cash drain for the company. Accounts receivable is often the largest cash requirement a growing company faces, and cannot be ignored without risking impairment of essential working capital.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Inventory is often the second-largest consumer of cash, and cash invested in inventory takes the longest time to be converted back into cash. If inventory grows faster than sales and expected future sales don’t increase correspondingly, the company may be wasting its cash—and risking future losses when it’s forced to liquidate old inventories.</p>
<p class="check-i-2"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Investments in the company, purchases of assets, borrowing money, and other activities to finance company operations and growth usually involve significant amounts of cash. They are most easily seen and tracked in the statement of cash flow.<a id="page_96"></a></p>
