<h2 class="h2"><strong>The Balance Sheet: Basic Summary of Value and Ownership</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>I</strong></span></span>n <a href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a> we compared the balance sheet to a snapshot. That was to give you an idea of its purpose, which is to show the financial condition of the business at a single point in time. Now let’s talk about what the balance sheet is and what it looks like.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev14"><strong>Assets and Ownership—They Really Do Balance!</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter we get into the nitty-gritty to help you understand the various line item labels that appear on a balance sheet, what they represent, and what you can learn from them.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Introducing the Wonder Widget Company</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s build our discussion on an example. Throughout this book, we use an imaginary company, the Wonder Widget Company, a manufacturer of a wonderful (and fictional) new product for home and garden. When we need an example, we look at our imaginary company’s financial department to provide it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s call first for a <em>statement of financial condition,</em> more commonly called a <em>balance sheet</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Notice that the two sides of the balance sheet shown in <a href="ch03.html#ch03fig1a">Figure 3-1</a>—Assets on the left and Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity on the right—are in balance, meaning they total the same amount. That’s nice. But what’s actually shown on this magically balanced report?</p>

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 3-1.</strong> Wonder Widget Company balance sheet (Liabilities and Stockholder’s Equity)</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s look at the line items on our balance sheet and discuss what they are and what they tell us about theWonder Widget Company. (On our balance sheet you will see some italicized comments in parentheses, for example, <em>(held by others)</em> next to the Deposits item under the Other Assets heading. These comments are there to help you understand the line item; they would not normally appear on the report.)</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev15"><strong>Current Assets—Liquidity Makes Things Flow</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Simply put, <em>Current Assets</em> are those assets that either are cash or are expected to become cash “currently,” that is, within the next 12 months. These assets produce most of the company’s liquidity, and they are the main sources of the business’ working capital. <a href="ch03.html#ch03fig1a">Figure 3-1</a> shows the most typical examples of current assets.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Cash itself is the most liquid asset of all and always the first item listed on any balance sheet. Cash includes Wonder Widget’s checking accounts, cash reserves, and petty cash fund. <em>Cash Reserves</em> might be in the form of savings accounts, bank certificates, money market accounts, short-term investments, or similar cash-like assets.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><a id="page_35"></a><img src="keyterms.jpg" alt="Image" width="96" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Liquidity</strong> The ability to meet current obligations with cash or other assets that can be quickly conSverted to cash in order to pay bills as they come due. In other words, the company has enough cash or enough assets that will soon become cash so it’s able to pay bills without running out of money.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Insolvency</strong> The opposite of <em>liquidity</em>; not having enough money to pay bills as they come due. Insolvency is often a precursor to a creditor revolt or even a bankruptcy filing.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Companies vary in their policies about listing all the details of their various cash accounts. Some simply show <em>Cash</em> or <em>Cash in Banks,</em> while others combine the details under a caption such as <em>Cash and Short-Term Investments</em> or the more common label used in our example, <em>Cash and Cash Equivalents</em>. The important thing about all the items in this section is that, if needed, they can be spent almost immediately.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Accounts Receivable</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Amounts due from customers and others usually appear next in the Current Assets section of the balance sheet. The largest of these is usually called <em>Accounts Receivable</em>; it typically means amounts due from customers as a result of sales made on credit. It’s expected that customers will pay for those sales within a relatively short time (typically 30–60 days), so they are classified as “current,” even if some customer accounts may actually be past due.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In some industries, business practice permits a much longer collection period, sometimes 6–9 months or more. This practice enables makers of seasonal products to spread out their manufacturing over most of the year and induce their customers to take delivery of goods (but not pay for them) well before they’ll be able to sell them, getting that inventory out of the manufacturers’ warehouses and into their customers’ warehouses.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>During a recession, it’s common for a company’s customers to experience cash flow problems that make it difficult for them to pay promptly. This might result in collections that go beyond one year, although that isn’t usually apparent from a glance at the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><a id="page_36"></a><img src="forexample.jpg" alt="Image" width="96" height="96"/></p>
<p class="side-title"><strong>L<small>ONG</small> C<small>OLLECTION</small> C<small>YCLES BY</small> I<small>NTENT</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">The toy industry is a good example of long collection periods. Toy stores sell most of their merchandise during the last two months of the year. Yet toy makers maintain their manufacturing activities over the entire year and sell to their customers under special arrangements that allow the stores to pay for those purchases <em>after</em> they sell them. That mostly means after the holidays, perhaps many months after the goods were purchased and delivered to the stores. This practice is called <em>dating,</em> not in the “boy meets girl” sense, but rather meaning the due date for payment has been extended. Sellers that engage in this practice must make sure they have enough cash or borrowing capacity to operate while they wait for payment.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>As a manager, you should remember that customers usually pay later than the terms your company originally granted them. The national average is estimated at about 45 days in normal economic times, longer than the customary 30-day terms printed on most suppliers’ invoices. In a recession, that period can stretch to 90 days or more, leaving some suppliers in dire straits for lack of cash. So you can’t always count on customers to pay their balances on time. This is one of the key cash flow planning issues companies must face in managing their resources effectively. If Wonder Widget’s customers don’t pay promptly, the company has less money to pay its suppliers and employees, and to replace goods it has sold.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>A typical balance sheet may show other amounts owed to the company in addition to accounts receivable. They might include loans to employees or officers, tax refunds from the government, and other amounts due that are not the usual accounts with customers. In all cases, by classifying them as Current Assets, management is expressing the expectation that these amounts will be collected within a year.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Allowance for Bad Debts</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Closely related to Accounts Receivable is an account called Allowance for Bad Debts or some similar label, which is not always shown separately on the balance sheet. This is a <em>reserve,</em> an estimated amount the company sets aside for the possibility that some customer balances will never be collected and will have to be written off. Any company that sells on credit has these kinds of issues to deal with—granting credit and managing customer relationships so that collection losses are as small as possible consistent with maximizing sales and with good business practice.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><a id="page_37"></a><img src="keyterms.jpg" alt="Image" width="96" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Write-off</strong> Removing from the balance receivable from customers an amount judged to be uncollectible. Recorded by reducing the customer account receivable balance and reducing by an equal amount the allowance for bad debts. Companies that do not use an allowance for bad debts may instead create a bad debt expense at the time of write off. Also sometimes referred to as a charge off.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Valuation adjustment account</strong> An account created to reduce the value of another account, e.g., accounts receivable, without actually reducing directly the balance of that other account. Thus the full amount of accounts receivable is visible on reports as is the actual amount expected to be collected, which is the net or difference between, in this case, accounts receivable and the allowance for bad debts, its valuation adjustment account. See also accumulated depreciation later in this chapter, another example of a valuation adjustment account.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Because companies cannot tell at first who will pay and who won’t, they often provide a reserve for such losses at the time sales are made, typically calculated as a percentage of all sales made in a given period. Such reserves can then absorb the cost of bad debt losses that may be recognized (written off) in future periods.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Companies build reserves by creating a <em>write-off to expense</em>. They then write off (recognize and record) uncollectible amounts against the reserve once they decide collecting the full amount due is unlikely. At any point in time, the Allowance for Bad Debts is effectively a valuation adjustment account that reduces the total amount of customer accounts receivable on the books to the net amount the company expects to collect.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">

<p class="image-b"><img src="tricksoftrade.jpg" alt="Image" width="103" height="97"/></p>
<p class="side-title"><strong>A<small>VOIDING A</small> C<small>ASH</small> M<small>ANAGEMENT</small> P<small>OTHOLE</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Every company has to manage its accounts carefully to ensure it gets paid in full and there are no significant bad debt losses. However, because periodic fluctuations in collections are a normal risk of doing business, smart managers with responsibility for the company’s cash accounts will arrange for credit lines with their banks so they can be sure they can meet their obligations to their creditors. A <em>credit line</em> is a commitment by the bank to lend a company a certain amount of money to tide it over until its customers pay their bills. The company borrows what it needs (within the credit limits) whenever it needs cash and repays the bank when it collects from its customers. Interest is charged only for the time the borrowed funds are in the company’s hands. (The bank may also charge a service fee for making the credit line available.)</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_38"></a><strong>Inventory</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The next item on our balance sheet is <em>Inventory,</em> a term used for production materials, products purchased, or products manufactured and held by the company until sold.</p>
<p class="indentb"><span class="none">  </span>A company that manufactures its products might show several categories of inventory, like those on Wonder Widget’s balance sheet:</p>
<p class="list-box-1a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  <strong>Raw Materials</strong>—Whatever the company uses in the manufacturing process, before it begins to change them into something else. It might be whole logs for a sawmill or it might be electric motors for washing machines. The amount on the balance sheet is the cost of these materials, the amount the company paid to its suppliers to purchase them.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="caution.jpg" alt="Image" width="80" height="104"/></p>
<p class="side-title"><strong>F<small>AILING TO</small> C<small>ONTROL</small> I<small>NVENTORY</small> L<small>OSSES</small> C<small>AN</small> C<small>OST A</small> B<small>UNDLE</small>!</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Companies maintain inventories of their products so they can promptly satisfy customer demand for those products. The risk for any company is that it will keep inventory on hand that never sells or that sells only at a deep discount, for a variety of reasons, including the following:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  It has more inventory than its customers wanted (such as new cars at the end of the model year).</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  It stocked items that its customers didn’t want to buy (such as marked-down fashion clothing at the end of the season).</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  The inventory became useless before anyone bought it (such as perishable food in the supermarket or a technology product that became obsolete as a result of a competitor’s innovations).</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  Inventory was lost or damaged or disappeared from theft or other causes and was not available to sell.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>When there are losses, inventory is revalued at a new, net realizable amount, and the difference becomes an expense on the company’s books. If not properly controlled, such expense can become a large and unpleasant shock to a company’s profit expectations. Companies typically examine and count their inventory periodically—at least annually, and sometimes as often as monthly—to avoid unexpected losses in value.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_39"></a><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  <strong>Work in Process</strong>—Products in the midst of the manufacturing process that no longer are raw materials but are not yet finished goods. The balance sheet includes raw material costs as well as some labor and related costs applied to these materials during the manufacturing process. We discuss this further when we talk about cost accounting in <a href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  <strong>Finished Goods</strong>—Fully manufactured products ready for sale to customers. The balance sheet shows all the costs needed to make the products, including labor and related overhead costs, such as factory rent, supervision, and product inspection.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>By contrast, retailers, distributors, and trading companies usually purchase fully manufactured products, which they resell without processing them further. Their balance sheet most likely shows only a single line called Inventory.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Prepaid Expenses</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Prepaid Expenses, an unusual asset among Current Assets, will never, except in rare cases, be turned into cash, in spite of our statement above that such conversion is a typical characteristic of current assets. <em>Prepaid expenses</em> are exactly that—expenses that have been paid in advance and therefore won’t have to be paid again. Thus, in a sneaky way they increase available cash in future months by enabling the company to avoid paying out that amount during the next 12 months. OK, so that’s a stretch, but that’s how it works—honest.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let me give you an example. Every company buys insurance of various kinds, and nearly every type of insurance has a premium that must be prepaid, typically a year in advance. Since insurance can be a costly item, companies allocate the cost of that protection over the period the company is protected. The company writes a check for 12 months of insurance protection and expenses the amount over the 12 months of protection, usually by charging 1/12 of the total to Expenses each month. The balance of the advance premium payment is considered an asset, and it rests in a prepaid expense account until it has been entirely written off to Expenses. Other examples of prepaid expenses are property taxes, income tax installments, or even marketing materials.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Prepaid expenses</strong> Amounts paid in advance to a vendor or creditor for goods and services. Because the purpose of the payments is to obtain benefits for the organization over time, the cost of these assets is charged against profits throughout the period, usually on a monthly basis. Prepaid expenses is a current asset because the company has paid for something and either someone is obligated to provide the company with services or it has purchased a supply of consumable goods, e.g., office supplies, that will be consumed and charged as an expense over an extended period.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev16"><a id="page_40"></a><strong>Fixed Assets—Property and Possessions</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Every company acquires physical assets that it uses to conduct its business—computers, manufacturing equipment, buildings, land, trucks, and so forth. Those assets are used for extended periods of time, usually years, and are thus not current assets in the sense of the items discussed above. These are usually called <em>Fixed Assets</em> or <em>Property, Plant, and Equipment</em> or—if no real estate or vehicles are owned—<em>Equipment and Furnishings</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Because such assets are used for a number of years and are not held for resale to customers, they are not considered sources of liquidity or cash flow. They are, well, “fixed” in place until they are no longer useful. At that point, they are either sold or discarded, and then replaced.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="smart.jpg" alt="Image" width="80" height="104"/></p>
<p class="side-title"><strong>A<small>VOID</small> G<small>ETTING</small> C<small>AUGHT WITH</small> Y<small>OUR</small> A<small>SSETS</small> D<small>OWN</small>!</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">In evaluating a company, look carefully at the relationship of the Fixed Assets to the Accumulated Depreciation shown on the balance sheet. If accumulated depreciation is a large percentage of total fixed assets and little remains to be written off, it may be a sign that the company is facing potentially heavy expenditures in the near future to replace aging or obsolete equipment. In an industry influenced by technology, such as automobile manufacturing, this may be even more of a concern. If instead the company decides to keep old equipment in place, it may incur higher maintenance and repair costs. Either way, these lines on the balance sheet could be a clue to future drains on cash flow or the need to borrow money for replacement purchases.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The smart strategy: Keep up maintenance programs on equipment with long service lives to avoid unnecessarily shortening their useful lives. When equipment must be replaced, use return on investment (ROI) calculations (see <a href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a>) to find the best way to finance the replacement.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_41"></a>Fixed assets may not move around much, but during their period of use their value declines substantially, often to zero by the end of their useful life. (The sole exception is land. It generally does not decline in value, and in fact is more likely to increase in value.) To recognize that reduction in value, a company will <em>depreciate,</em> or systematically write down, the cost of each fixed asset (except land) over the period that it’s used in the business.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>This reduction in value is charged to expense when recognized, under the label of Depreciation Expense on the income statement (see <a href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>). On the balance sheet, the total amount written off to expense since a fixed asset was purchased appears under Accumulated Depreciation. This account is shown immediately after the original cost of the fixed assets as a deduction from the original cost, so that the net value of the fixed assets is readily apparent to anyone who reads the statement. Think of this as a valuation adjustment account similar to the Allowance for Bad Debts discussed earlier.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev17"><strong>Other Assets—The “Everything Else” Category</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">At the bottom of the Assets side on most balance sheets is a catchall category called, cleverly, <em>Other Assets</em>. These are company holdings that are neither current nor fixed. Assets in this category are not expected to become cash in the next 12 months, and they are not real estate, machines, or equipment used in the company’s business operations. They may not even be directly related to the company’s business.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>For example, a deposit paid to a landlord from whom the company leases its offices would appear under other assets, since most such leases are multiyear commitments. (A lease deposit is not really a current expense to the company, because it can be either applied against final rent under the lease or returned to the tenant when the property is vacated. So a rent deposit may be disbursed at the beginning of the lease but not become expense until the end of the lease, if at all.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>An investment in another company would be listed here as well. Wonder Widget apparently has made at least one such investment. Putting this item in the noncurrent category indicates the company intends to hold this investment for an extended period. In other words, it’s not a <a id="page_42"></a>readily marketable security that’s going to be sold as soon as the price goes up a few points.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev18"><strong>Current Liabilities—Repayment Is Key</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Liabilities side of the balance sheet also begins with the most current liabilities. Here, too, liquidity is the measure of the label “current,” but in the case of liabilities it is <em>negative</em> liquidity—cash going <em>out</em> the door. Current liabilities are all the debts the company expects to pay within the next 12 months, the same period in which the current assets are expected to become cash.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The relationship between assets and liabilities is evident if you think about it for a moment. Current assets will become cash to pay off current liabilities. That’s the principal of working capital in any company. If you look at Wonder Widget’s balance sheet (<a href="ch03.html#ch03fig1a">Figure 3-1</a>), you’ll notice that current assets are about twice current liabilities. That’s usually thought of as a good ratio to ensure that the cash is available when needed. You’ll read more about that relationship in <a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, when we discuss key performance indicators.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Working capital</strong> A common but theoretical way to measure the amount of a company’s ready liquidity. To calculate it, deduct current liabilities from current assets. Also called <em>Networking Capital</em>. For example, Wonder Widget’s current assets total $1,667,000, and its current liabilities total $819,000. Thus it has working capital of $848,000.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Accounts Payable</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">This account includes all the unpaid bills from all the company’s suppliers and service providers. This is usually the largest item among a company’s current liabilities. Accounts Payable is usually the first item listed under Current Liabilities.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Amounts in this category should be paid in accordance with trade terms printed on the invoices. Typically that’s 30 days, or whatever other payment period is granted by the supplier. Sometimes companies take longer to pay their bills than the official period, as noted above for accounts receivable. In such cases, customers are, in essence, borrowing money from their trade creditors to help increase the financial resources at work in their company. This is called <em>leverage,</em> and we bring this up again in <a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a> and in discussing ratios in <a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>. When Wonder Widget extends its payment period by delaying payments to its creditors, it benefits from the use of leverage. When Wonder Widget’s customers do the same thing, its accounts receivable take longer to collect and it’s on the wrong side of that leverage.</p>

<p class="image-b"><a id="page_43"></a><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>

<p class="side-title"><strong>D<small>ELAY</small> C<small>AN</small> P<small>AY</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">If a company can earn 12 percent annually by buying and reselling merchandise, it can earn almost 0.25 percent on every dollar that it can delay paying its creditors by a week. If this company has an average balance of $50,000 in accounts payable, it could earn about $125 a week, or over $6,000 a year. Of course, it may not be worth it if the company incurs additional charges or jeopardizes its standing with creditors.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Often a company shows other amounts it owes under separate labels to make sure readers of the report know there are amounts due for these “special” liabilities. Wonder Widget’s balance sheet shows income taxes payable as such a category.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">

<p class="noindent">Keep this in mind: Despite all the headlines around bank lending practices, venture capital investing, public offerings of stock, etc., the largest single source of operating capital for most businesses is the money they borrow from their creditors, that is, accounts payable. Almost every entrepreneur has a few stories about the struggles he or she went through to squeeze more working capital out of the balance sheet. This usually means increasing available cash by delaying payment to creditors, while at the same time trying to make sure their customers don’t do the same to them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Sometimes the squeeze play goes against you; the company can’t collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis, and its creditors won’t let it slow down its payments. The result can be a disastrous cash flow crunch. Companies in the construction industry often face this. Their customers hold up payment for unfinished loose ends on a project, while their subcontractors must be paid to prevent them from filing mechanic’s liens on the property.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_44"></a><strong>Accrued Payroll</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Next on Wonder Widget’s statement of financial condition (an alternative name for balance sheet) is the <em>Accrued Payroll</em> account, which represents the amount earned by employees but not yet paid to them. Since employees are typically paid for time already worked, not in advance, almost every company has some amount of compensation earned by its employees but not yet paid to them. When a company keeps its accounting records on the accrual basis (refer to <a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a> for a discussion of accounting methods), such liabilities are recorded when they become owed, even though they don’t actually have to be paid until later. An exception would be companies that pay employees on the last day of their workweek. In this case, at the end of a payday they would not owe any money to their employees—until the following day.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Other Accrued Liabilities</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Just as Wonder Widget records its payroll earned but not yet paid, a company usually has other such liabilities. These may be expenses the company has incurred but for which it has not yet received an invoice to record. To ensure the expense is recorded in the right accounting period, the company’s accountants accrue the liability rather than wait for an invoice to arrive or a check to be issued. Examples might include large purchases for which the supplier has not yet invoiced the company or interest expense on a loan that doesn’t get invoiced but for which the bank will automatically charge the company.</p>

<p class="noindentb"><strong>Loan covenant</strong> Clauses in a loan agreement that require the borrower to do certain things (<em>affirmative covenants</em>) or not do others (<em>negative covenants</em>) during the term of the loan agreement. Some typical covenants include the following:</p>
<p class="list-box-1a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  The company must maintain adequate insurance.</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  The company must furnish the lender with financial statements quarterly and annually.</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  The company cannot allow other liens on company assets.</p>
<p class="list-boxa"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  The company cannot merge with another company or acquire another company.</p>
<p class="list-box-2a"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  The company must make enough profit to cover loan payments.</p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="none">  </span>Banks often monitor compliance with loan covenants quarterly, based on the financial statements, and sometimes require that a corporate officer or independent accountant issue a compliance certificate as evidence that no covenant violation has occurred.</p>

<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_45"></a><strong>Notes Payable and Other Bank Debt</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Loans from banks and other lenders that represent borrowed money, and not simply trade accounts with suppliers, are always shown separately. This is because loans and repayments typically have special terms. When you see Notes Payable to anyone, particularly banking institutions, you can be pretty sure the company has agreed to some limitations on its range of activity, called <em>covenants,</em> required by the lender as a way of trying to ensure the loan repayment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>While borrowing to finance the business is discussed in <a href="ch10.html#ch10">Chapter 10</a>, keep in mind that when such loans appear on the balance sheet, you can expect to see other kinds of guarantees provided to the lender. These might include pledging assets as collateral, a personal guarantee of repayment by the owners of the company, or perhaps even a contingent claim on company ownership.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Current Portion of Long-Term Debt</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Refer to the discussion below of long-term debt. The “current” label represents the portion of that debt that must be repaid within the next 12 months.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev19"><strong>Long-Term Liabilities—Borrowed Capital</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You might see a wide variety of long-term borrowings on a company’s balance sheet, including the line items seen in <a href="ch03.html#ch03fig1a">Figure 3-1</a>. Rather than describe all the items you might find listed under Long-Term Liabilities, let’s look for a moment at the types seen on our sample balance sheet.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Lease Contracts</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>Lease Contracts</em> label shows commitments made by a company in order to lease equipment or other assets at favorable payment terms, usually followed by a modest buyout option at the end of the contract. According to current U.S. accounting rules, when a lease contract is designed primarily to finance the intended purchase of the asset, the asset and the liability are recorded on the lessee’s books and accounted for as if the asset had actually been purchased with a loan agreement instead of a <a id="page_46"></a>lease contract. A lease can also be a long-term rental agreement in which there is no actual transfer of ownership, and therefore no recording of the asset and liability on the company’s books. However, some leases are written more like purchase agreements, which is why they often appear on balance sheets, as in our example. There is some discussion among accounting rule makers to require even long-term rental agreements to be shown on the balance sheet, to alert readers that assets are being used, and liabilities incurred, even though no formal purchase agreement exists. A draft accounting rule was published in late 2013 which may ultimately make this change a requirement in public financial reports.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Long-Term Debt</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">A company with financing needs that extend for years might opt to borrow money with a payment term that stretches out as far as possible, enabling the company to put the borrowed money to use and earn enough to more easily repay the loan. In such cases the loan’s entire amount is reported as a Long-Term Debt, and the portion of that loan due to be paid within the next 12 months—meaning “currently due”—is shown under Current Liabilities. This is what Wonder Widget has done in our example.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Loans from Stockholders</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">This is another special category of loan, most often seen on the balance sheets of privately owned companies operated by the owners. For some privately owned companies, this is how owners put money into the company when it needs cash and take it out when it’s not needed. All too frequently, however, business conditions do not improve soon, so Loans from Stockholders may stay on the balance sheet for years. In fact, banks and other outside lenders may require that such loans remain unpaid as long as the company has outside loans. Thus, these amounts can end up looking more like owners’ equity than loans to the company. This is often a frustrating reality for entrepreneurs and small business owners who had hoped to be repaid sooner.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev20"><strong>Ownership Comes in Various Forms</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Owners’ Equity or Stockholders’ Equity (for a corporation) or Capital (for a proprietorship or partnership) is the owners’ stake in the business. It <a id="page_47"></a>includes what they have invested to launch, to finance, or to refinance the company, plus what the company has earned in profits since it was founded.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>As already noted, it can also include amounts the owners have loaned to the business that they cannot get back due to some subsequent loan agreement with a bank or other lending source. Such loans are always shown in under Liabilities on the balance sheet, and never under Equity because they are not legally investment capital until and unless ultimate repayment is formally relinquished. Labels that may appear in this section include the following.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Capital Stock and Contributed Capital</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Capital Stock</em> is the amount paid into the company by investors to purchase stock, at some nominal amount per share. It’s usually a small part of what the investors actually paid, for legal reasons too complicated to discuss here. Let’s just say that investors usually pay more for a share of stock than the amount shown under this label; the balance of the proceeds is reported under a heading such as Contributed Capital or a similar description. When combined, these two amounts represent the total amount formally contributed by owners and investors to finance the company.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterms.jpg" alt="Image" width="96" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Capital stock</strong> The amount paid into the company by investors to purchase stock at some nominal amount per share; the par value printed on each share of stock. <em>Par value</em> is an arbitrary dollar amount assigned to shares of stock for accounting purposes during the incorporation process, usually set as low as possible to minimize legal restrictions on the amount classified as par value. Many incorporations today assign no par value to their shares to avoid this problem entirely.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Additional contributed capital</strong> or <strong>additional paid-in capital</strong> The amount paid into the company by investors to purchase stock, above its par value. Also sometimes a general label that includes both capital stock and additional paid-in capital, especially when capital stock has been issued at no par value.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev21"><strong>Capital Stock Comes In Several Flavors</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Occasionally a company has reasons to issue several kinds of capital stock, usually for the purpose of raising capital or restricting ownership rights of some stockholders compared to others. This occurs when <a id="page_48"></a>established, publicly traded companies or emerging companies raiser money from outside investors. In these cases we have to distinguish between common stock and preferred stock.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Common Stock</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Common stock</em> is generally owned by the <em>residual owners</em>—those who own whatever value in the company is not committed to others. There are occasions when a company issues two or more classes of common stock. Some may have different voting rights without surrendering their residual profit-sharing rights. Other common stock might contain different participation in profits or voting. A good example is the stock of Berkshire Hathaway (remember Warren Buffett?). That company has Class A common shares with full voting rights, and Class B shares that participate in profits differently and have limited voting rights.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Preferred Stock</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Preferred shares,</em> by contrast, are typically issued to investors who want a fixed return on their investment and are less interested in voting rights. Preferred shares typically have a fixed rate dividend that they will earn each year—4 or 5 or 6.25 percent, etc., and limited or no voting rights. And talk about variety: A large company may issue a number of classes or series of preferred shares at various times to raise money at different dividend, or <em>coupon,</em> rates to meet investor demands. Some types of preferred shares may even be convertible to common shares at the owner’s option, and some may be subject to buyback at the issuer’s option. Bank of America, for example, had 20 different issues of preferred stock outstanding at the end of 2012, each with different terms and different dividend rates.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Retained Earnings</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Every company, from its inception, develops a history of profits and losses. Profits add to retained earnings and losses reduce Retained Earnings. If a company operates with overall profitability, it accumulates a substantial amount of earnings over time. If it’s a <em>proprietorship</em> (unincorporated, one owner) or a <em>partnership</em> (unincorporated, two or more owners), these earnings are usually taxable to the owner(s) immediately, so the earnings are typically paid out to the owner(s) each year as dividends or distributions of profits.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindentb"><strong>Retained earnings</strong> Profits of a business that have not been paid out to the owners or stockholders (as dividends) as of the balance sheet date. These earnings are reinvested in the business.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_49"></a>However, if the company is a corporation, its owners are generally not taxed on the company’s accumulated profits until the company chooses to distribute those earnings to its owners in the form of cash dividends. In the interim, the accumulated earnings not distributed to its owners are shown on the balance sheet as retained earnings.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Earnings are retained in the business for reasons other than to avoid paying taxes on them. These include enabling the business to retain cash for expansion or to purchase land, buildings, or equipment (fixed assets) to facilitate its operations. The company may also be building a “war chest” to enable it to buy other companies, protect itself against a possible catastrophe, or repurchase its own stock when prices are low.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Wonder Widget is a relatively new company, so its retained earnings are still low. Some companies actually have negative retained earnings, because they’ve lost more money than they’ve made over their existence. (This is the situation for many airlines, for example.) You can recognize this by the label Deficit in Retained Earnings. This is often an indication that you might not want to buy their stock now, as they may not yet have figured out how to make money in their business. (This was a story heard frequently in the aftermath of the 2000–2001 dot-com collapse.)</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev22"><strong>Using This Report Effectively</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The balance sheet is the status report of the company’s financial health. It shows where the company is strong, such as good cash balances and low amounts of debt, and where it is weak, such as large amounts of debt classified as current, minimal retained earnings, etc.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Often the answers the balance sheet provides are your cue to ask, “Why?” It’s a good idea to be familiar enough with the balance sheet to know which questions to ask.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Pay particular attention to the ratios and analysis tools that we discuss in <a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="ch09.html#ch09">9</a>. They are excellent ways to get more information in less time when looking at a balance sheet.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev23"><a id="page_50"></a><strong>Manager’s Checklist for <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a></strong></h3>
<p class="check-i-1"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> The balance sheet is the report of the company’s financial condition at a specific moment. It provides valuable information about the success of the company’s cash management practices, its history of profitability, and the adequacy of its invested capital. Often the most valuable information it provides is simply suggesting the right questions to ask.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Current assets and current liabilities are closely related. Current assets are liquid and should be convertible to cash within a 12-month period. Current liabilities, in turn, must be repaid within that same 12-month period, usually from the cash raised by converting current assets. The difference between the two is called <em>working capital</em> or <em>net working capital</em>.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> A large amount of accounts receivable may look good on the balance sheet, but their collectability is the most important issue, and that’s not always apparent by looking at the total. Look at the allowance for bad debts and customer-by-customer details to better understand the true quality of this line item.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Inventory represents a constant management challenge and can be a high-risk area for losses unless inventory management practices are solid. Inventory can cost a company money in many ways including deterioration, obsolescence, and breakage.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Accounts payable is the largest source of day-to-day financing for most companies. Delaying payment can provide temporary relief for cash-strapped companies, while causing accounts receivable collection problems for the creditors.</p>
<p class="check-i-2"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> All company assets have been paid for with capital that was provided either by creditors (liabilities) or investors (stockholders’ equity).<a id="page_51"></a></p>
