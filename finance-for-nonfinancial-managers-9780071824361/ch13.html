<h2 class="h2"><strong>Financing the Business: Understanding the Debt versus Equity Options</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>T</strong></span></span>hroughout this book we’ve referred to the investment in a business that provides the cash to begin operations. We’ve also looked at a balance sheet that shows debt owed by the business—money borrowed for some corporate purpose. But we’ve yet to talk about how that money is raised and how the debt or equity gets onto the books.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>While there are many books on this subject, we only need to preview this important area. In these final chapters, we look at both debt and equity financing: what they are, how they work, and why an owner or CEO might choose one or the other or both to meet the company’s financing needs.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch13lev92"><strong>The Strategy of Borrowing Money</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Recall from earlier chapters the concept of leverage, using borrowed money to increase the amount of capital available to a business. As discussed in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, leverage is useful to virtually every company, in part because much of it—trade credit—is interest-free. The part that isn’t free is money borrowed through formal agreements such as bank loans. This chapter covers long-term and short-term borrowing, plus various forms of equity. But first a few comments on the nature of interest rates may be useful.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>To begin, a word about competition: Lending is a competitive business, particularly among commercial banks. Large and small banks compete <a id="page_200"></a>for your business, just like the TV ads proclaim. Every bank offers a range of borrowing options. Even though banks pay similar rates for the money they receive in deposits and federal loans, they often have different goals in terms of the kinds of loans they want on their books. Bank A may have only 40 percent home mortgage loans when its target is 50 percent, so it will likely offer favorable rates to attract more home mortgage borrowers. Bank B may have reached its goal with mortgage loans but is behind target on construction loans, so it will offer favorable financing to builders to bring in that kind of business. Thus their respective home mortgage rates may be quite different, even though they both pay the same rate for their money. It pays to shop around, whether you’re an individual, a small business, or a mega corporation. Then there’s the interest rate “market” itself that affects banks, and by extension every borrower from a bank. During the recovery from the financial markets crash of 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) chose to keep interest rates at near-historic lows, and as this book was written, rates were still closer to zero than to historical averages. What does that do for borrowers? It gives us an opportunity to convert all our credit needs to low-cost loans. So it’s good for borrowers. For banks, not so much. Here’s why:</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Banks only make money when they put their money to work, and that means making loans. Their profit comes from the <em>spread,</em> the difference between the rates they pay—primarily to the Fed—and the rates they charge to borrowers. Low rates mean their spreads are smaller. That’s the equivalent of a gross margin squeeze in business, and we all know that’s bad for profits. So if you’re a bank and your margins are being squeezed, your best solution is to sell more stuff or lend more money. And that’s what creates competition among banks.</p>

<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterms.jpg" alt="Image" width="96" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Spread</strong> A banking industry term that refers to the difference between the rate a bank pays for its money and the rate at which it can lend that money. If a bank borrows from the Fed at 2 percent and lends out that money for 4.5 percent, the spread is 2.5 percent, or 250 basis points.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Basis point</strong> A banking industry term that means 1/100 of a percentage point. Thus, 100 basis points is another way of saying 1 percent, and because many transactions are set in fractions of a percent, the use of basis points became common shorthand.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_201"></a>Then there’s the <em>yield curve,</em> the difference over time between long-term and short-term rates. We can learn a lot from the yield curve at any point in time, and the savvy business owner can save money by observing what it says about interest rate trends. Interest rates as this is written are near historic lows because central banks around the world—led largely by the Fed—use low rates as a way to help their economies grow. It’s expected that rates will rise over time to more normal levels. But what does “normal” look like? And why do we care?</p>
<p class="none"> </p>

<p class="image-r"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Yield curve</strong> A line on a chart that plots, at given points in time, the interest rates of bonds of equal credit quality but differing maturity dates. The most frequently reported yield curve—that of U.S. government debt—compares the rates on 3-month, 2-year, 5-year, and 30-year U.S. Treasury debt. This yield curve is used as a benchmark for other debt in the market, such as mortgage rates or bank lending rates. The curve is also used to predict changes in economic output and growth. Yield to a lender is what the interest rate is to a borrower.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a href="ch13.html#ch13fig1">Figure 13-1</a> shows a normal yield curve in which short-term rates are lower than long-term rates because of the greater risk perceived by lenders when committing funds for a longer term. In a normal economy, short-term lending rates are lower because lenders don’t have to wait so <a id="page_202"></a>long to get repaid, thus those loans are assumed to bear less risk. Sometimes, however, this curve becomes inverted, with current rates higher than longer maturities’ rates.</p>
<div class="group">

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 13-1.</strong> Normal yield curve</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>This is often the case when the market sees economic downward pressure in the future, as would be the case if a recession were anticipated. This was true in 2007, for example, when long-term rates were actually lower than short-term rates. As we now know, a major global recession followed a year later. By 2013 the yield curve had reversed and again was in the normal pattern, with long-term rates higher than short-term rates. Now to the “Why do we care?” part.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>First, because of the historical reliability of the yield curve, having an advance warning that an economic downturn may be in the offing should give you good reason to line up any financing you’ll need over the next few years, preferably at long-term rates, because it may be harder to borrow in a downturn when banks themselves are trying to preserve capital. It could be a good time to convert your short-term credit line into a long-term loan, for example. Second, the yield curve is a ready reference for where to look for the most favorable interest rates for a company’s normal borrowing needs. All of that, of course, is subject to the bank competition discussed above.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch13lev93"><strong>How a Business Gets Financed: In the Beginning and Over Time</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">A company obtains working capital either by selling a portion of the company to investors (which we discuss in <a href="ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a>) or by getting a loan from a bank or other lending source. There are seemingly endless variations of debt, from basic forms of borrowing that we discuss in this chapter, to more exotic borrowing options that are beyond the scope of this book. The principal common attribute of all these forms of debt is that they require repayment at some point, unlike equity financing, which involves the permanent sale of a share of ownership. That seems simple enough, but there are exceptions: Convertible debt may, under certain circumstances, be exchanged for equity and not repaid, and sometimes equity ownership in an emerging company carries a condition that the company may repurchase it, again under certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_203"></a>That said, let’s look at the principal kinds of debt you’re most likely to encounter and not concern ourselves with the exceptions.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Convertible debt</strong> Money loaned under an agreement that gives the lender the right under certain conditions to forego payment of part or all of the debt in return for some other asset, typically ownership—shares of common stock—in the borrower company. These agreements may have other conditions, such as the conversion rate, the length of time that conversion is permitted, etc.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch13lev94"><strong>Short-Term Debt: Balancing Working Capital Needs</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Every company has short-term debt of one kind or another, obligations that it must repay some time in the next 12 months. Its purpose is to extend the company’s working capital resources and to put more money to work earning for the company, so the owners don’t need to put more of their own cash into the company’s bank account. Short-term debt includes both short-term bank loans and traditional trade credit.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The most common kind of trade credit is accounts payable to suppliers, typically extended for 30 days at a time and without formal loan agreements. However, many companies also have formal arrangements to obtain additional short-term debt in the form of loans from banks or other lenders. Here are some examples of working capital needs that may be relieved by short-term borrowing:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Increasing accounts receivable balances, perhaps to finance rapidly growing sales on credit or a slowdown in receiving payment of open customer balances;</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Building inventory due to a planned new product introduction, preparing for a heavy selling season, or avoiding an upcoming supplier price increase;</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Covering a temporary cash shortage caused by operating losses the company has incurred but expects to recover from soon, provided it can rebuild its working capital in the meantime; or</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Preparing for a business cycle that inherently includes alternating periods of negative cash flow (incurring costs to manufacture products for sale) and positive cash flow (to sell what was manufactured).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_204"></a>The following examples show the variety of short-term borrowing that’s possible.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="tricksoftrade.jpg" alt="Image" width="103" height="97"/></p>
<p class="side-Head"><strong>U<small>SE</small> S<small>HORT</small>-T<small>ERM</small> D<small>EBT</small> O<small>NLY</small> <small>FOR</small> S<small>HORT</small>-T<small>ERM</small> N<small>EEDS</small></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Business owners squeezed for cash to expand sometimes make a big mistake. Because short-term financing is often easier to get than long-term financing, they borrow short-term money, then renew or stretch out their repayments, using the money to satisfy long-term needs such as multiyear marketing programs, new product development and introduction, and so on. If the long-term plans take longer to bear fruit than management expected, the businesses may be strapped for cash to repay short-term debt that can no longer be delayed, and working capital can be negatively affected.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The key: Use short-term debt for working capital that will generate the funds to repay the loan when it comes due, and use long-term debt to finance long lead-time projects for which the timing of a return is either long term or uncertain.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Revolving Credit Line</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">A <em>revolving credit line</em> is a promise by a bank (typically) or other lender to provide cash on demand up to a certain maximum, the <em>credit limit</em>. The borrower obtains a revolving credit line based on the projected need for short-term cash and the available collateral. The company then borrows—or draws against the line—as it needs the cash, and repays it when the need is past. Thus, actual borrowing fluctuates over time, and the cash advanced by the bank revolves; in other words, money is borrowed, repaid, and reborrowed as the borrower’s cash needs change. The lender typically charges a variable rate for the amount outstanding and may charge other credit line fees as well.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Revolving credit line</strong> An agreement by a bank or other lender to provide cash on demand up to a specified limit and then, as the borrower pays back all or part of the loan, to allow the borrower to borrow up to that limit again, as often as needed. Also known as a <em>revolver</em>.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Revolving credit lines may be collateralized by liens on the company’s assets, such as accounts receivable, inventories, equipment, or property. Typically a lender extends credit up to 70–90 percent of eligible receivables and perhaps 50–70 percent of eligible <a id="page_205"></a>inventories. These credit lines may be unsecured for the lender’s financially strongest customers. Most companies with short-term credit needs try to satisfy their needs by using revolving credit lines, either secured or unsecured, because these lines enable them to obtain cash when they need it and to limit their interest expense when they don’t.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Collateral</strong> Assets pledged by a borrower to protect the lender’s interests by guaranteeing the loan repayment. A loan is <em>collateralized</em> or <em>secured</em> by the assets pledged. The lender almost always wants the collateral to exceed the loan amount, to ensure that in the event of default there is some cushion in disposing of the collateral and getting full repayment.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Revolving credit lines are widely used to meet temporary working capital needs. Such lines provide easy and flexible borrowing, and allow a company to control borrowing costs. Loans are for working capital purposes and can be used for any business purpose, as long as the lenders are protected (usually) by adequate collateral.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Accounts Receivable Loans: Collecting Before You Collect</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Companies that don’t have the cash to finance their operations while waiting for their customers to pay them and companies that have the cash but want to use it for other purposes may borrow from a bank or other lender, pledging their accounts receivable as loan collateral. This is a variation of the revolving credit line, in that the lender advances a certain percentage of eligible receivables in the expectation that the company will repay the line when it collects the accounts. Terms and conditions vary widely, including limitations on which receivables are eligible, what constitutes a good credit risk, how quickly advances must be repaid, and so on. Advances against receivables enable the company to retain control of its collection activities and its credit risk (unlike factoring, discussed below, in which both control and risk often—but not always—pass to the lender).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Accounts receivable lending works much like the revolver (the loan, not the gun), except that accounts receivable are the only assets used to calculate how much may be borrowed. Advances are usually limited to 70–90 percent of the value of the eligible collateral. Depending on the <a id="page_206"></a>lender, there may be monthly or quarterly statistical reporting and quarterly or annual audits by bank accountants to satisfy the lender that the company is properly handling its paperwork and collection activities. Borrowing cost for such loans is best characterized as medium—not the lowest rates and not the highest. Actual rates depend on the lender’s credit policies and the borrower’s creditworthiness. Even though these are considered collateral loans, the lender’s willingness to lend and its flexibility on terms and conditions are also influenced by the overall relationship between borrower and lender.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Factoring: Selling Accounts Receivable and Passing Along the Risk (Sometimes)</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">For companies whose credit rating is not strong enough to warrant other forms of borrowing, there’s the option of <em>factoring,</em> which is selling the company’s accounts receivable balances for immediate cash. This is a widely used but relatively high-cost option—typically from 15–30 percent APR—so companies generally don’t choose factoring if another option is available.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Here’s how it works. A factoring company, or factor, purchases the customer invoices individually, following a detailed review to identify accounts and invoices that qualify. The factor pays the company for each invoice, after deducting a discount, usually 3–5 percent of the invoice amount. The discount compensates the factor for two things: (1) interest on the money from the time it’s paid to the borrower until the customer pays the invoice, and (2) a premium for assuming the collection risk of the customer. The company typically notifies its customers that its invoices should be paid to the factor rather than the company. When the customer pays in due course, the factor receives 100 percent of the balance due and thus gets its money back plus fees. The factor periodically pays the remaining balance from what it has collected (after fees) back to the borrower. This process involves a lot of paperwork in selling the individual invoices and in documents flowing back and forth, often daily—from the borrower to support amounts sold and from the factor to document amounts collected, advanced, charged back under recourse agreements, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Besides their fees and account-by-account scrutiny, the factor may build in additional safeguards against loss. It may, for example, purchase <a id="page_207"></a>invoices “with recourse,” meaning it has the right to sell the invoices back to the borrower if it has not collected from the customer within a certain time, thus protecting the factor from a loss of principal. There may be other fees and restrictions that effectively increase the cost of the loan.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Factoring</strong> The selling of a company’s accounts receivable at a discount to a business (a factor) that assumes the credit risk of the accounts and receives cash as the customers pay their invoices.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Certain kinds of companies use factoring as a normal business tool, perhaps because they are not sufficiently well financed from the beginning or because margins are so thin that they are unable to earn enough profits to build a working capital base. The U.S. garment industry, populated by many small, creatively driven businesses, is an example.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>

<p class="noindent">Factoring is a good example of borrowing that’s so costly that it can adversely affect profitability if not used with care, especially by companies with marginal profits. For example, a cash-strapped company with a hot product may feel it makes sense to pay a factor to get early access to cash so it can continue to expand sales. But factoring charges add up fast.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Let’s suppose a company factors $1.2 million of sales under a plan that charges 4 percent per invoice (a midrange price), and customer balances are outstanding for two months on average. That means the company borrows, repays, and reborrows $200,000 six times a year, paying $8,000 in fees each time ($200,000 × 4%). In a year, the company pays $48,000 in factoring fees ($8,000 × 6)—but has the use of <em>only $200,000</em> of the factor’s money at any one time. That’s an <em>effective interest rate of 24 percent!</em> If the company nets 10 percent pretax profit from sales, its pretax profit of $120,000 has been cut by <em>40 percent</em> to gain access to that cash.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Factoring may be a good decision, but only in special circumstances. Managers should do their homework before choosing this option. Any decision to use factoring for financing should be reviewed with your financial advisor and should be accompanied by a plan to systematically remove the need in the future.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_208"></a><strong>Honorable Mention of Some Other Short-Term Borrowing Techniques</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Flooring.</strong> <em>Flooring</em> is buying inventory without paying for it until it’s sold. This is a little like consignment buying, commonly used years ago to induce retailers to carry products they didn’t want to pay for until they were sold. The difference? Flooring is a financing method for high-ticket items like cars and boats. Dealers cannot typically afford to pay for a showroom full of inventory, so they borrow against the inventory, item by item, and pay off the loan when they sell the item. They pay the lender—such as GE Capital, a bank, or a finance company—interest (the <em>flooring charge</em>) based on how long they held the item on their premises. Financing plans can include only inventory, or a combination of inventory and receivables.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Inventory financing.</strong> <em>Inventory financing</em> is another way to use inventory as collateral. It’s possible to obtain financing using the company’s inventory as collateral, but it isn’t easy. It must be possible to sell the inventory readily if necessary, which means that only certain kinds of raw materials and finished goods qualify. Even then, the loan amount is limited to 50 percent or so of the inventory value, and the lender often wants additional collateral. Inventory can be hard to liquidate if the borrower defaults, so the lender has a greater risk of loss, so the lender protects itself against potential losses by setting a conservative inventory lending limit. This kind of lending is less common today than it used to be.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Purchase order financing.</strong> <em>Purchase order financing</em> goes one step beyond factoring. A company that wins a large customer order it doesn’t have the cash to fulfill can borrow money on the strength of the purchase order to enable it to manufacture the products to fill the order. This is very high-risk lending, because the lender is betting the borrower will be able to make the product and successfully deliver it. As a result, the requirements for this kind of borrowing are even stricter than for factoring: strong customer, firm purchase order, borrower with a good track record of completing its work, and so on. Only the smallest companies with the weakest working capital position or those with unusually large, one-time orders typically seek this kind of financing.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch13lev95"><a id="page_209"></a><strong>Long-Term Debt: Semipermanent Capital or Asset Acquisition Financing</strong></h3>
<h4 class="h4a"><strong>Term Loans the Old-Fashioned Way</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">A <em>term loan</em> is the kind of loan you and I use to purchase real estate or to finance a college education. We borrow the money, use it for its intended purpose, and repay it in installments over several years.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>How does it work? To get such a loan, a company applies to a bank or other lender. Upon approval, the company signs documents promising to repay the loan over some number of years in monthly installments, including principal and interest, and the bank advances the money. The bank usually requires a pledge of collateral to make the loan. This might be a specific asset or it might be all assets of the company not already encumbered with debt. If the loan is for real estate, the real estate is always pledged as the loan collateral. If the company is privately held, collateral might also include a personal guarantee by the owners. Interest costs for such a loan are typically moderate, as a company must be in reasonably sound financial condition to be approved. Such borrowers are in demand, and banks often compete for the business of solid business borrowers.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Who uses a term loan? A company might do so to finance the acquisition of another company, to develop or improve products for its market, or to obtain funds to buy or build a factory. The idea is to put a large amount of money to work immediately and repay it over time as the company receives the benefits of the front-end investment. The company expects the additional earnings or other benefits to more than cover the cost of servicing the debt, including principal and interest, for the life of the loan and hopefully beyond. The challenge for many companies is, before they take on the long-term debt obligation, to do a thorough enough analysis that the return is reasonably assured. The risk is that a company won’t be able to repay the loan, which means a painful series of meetings and negotiations with the lenders as everyone tries to work out a win-win solution to the dilemma. This is the stuff of which corporate turnarounds are made.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Equipment Purchasing or Leasing: Two Paths to One Goal</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Equipment purchasing is what you do when you buy a new car. You pick <a id="page_210"></a>the car, negotiate the loan, and buy the car; the lender pays the seller; and you make installment payments to the lender until you’ve paid off the loan and you finally own the car. In the same manner, a company buys manufacturing equipment or computers or, for that matter, new cars.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The business purpose of an <em>equipment purchase loan</em> is to extend the cash outlay for the equipment over a period of time that relates more closely to the length of time the purchase provides a benefit to the company. Such loans are typically paid off in three to five years, well before the equipment is worn out, so the benefit continues after the loan is repaid, and the strain on the company’s cash balance is minimized. This is particularly valuable to rapidly growing companies that, as we’ve noted earlier, have a constant need for cash to finance their growth. The cost of such loans is typically related to the borrower’s creditworthiness and the expected value of the collateral over the life of the loan. The interest rates charged vary, but are higher than loans secured by stable collateral and lower than loans with greater risk, like accounts receivable financing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Payments are structured to provide a level payment of principal and interest each month. That means, of course, that earlier payments are mostly interest with little principal reduction. (Have you ever looked at your home loan statements a year or so after buying or refinancing? You’re not paying down much principal, are you?) The level payment makes repayment manageable for the borrower, but the downside is the low rate of principal reduction until late in the life of the loan. One option: shorten the life of the loan. Principal reduction increases in shorter-term loans, and total interest cost correspondingly decreases.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>A variation on the equipment purchase loan is the equipment lease. The cash management objective is the same, but the money is often easier to find because the lender/lessor has a stronger hold on the collateral until the company has paid the full amount of the loan. In an equipment purchase, the lender has a lien on the equipment, but the borrower actually owns the equipment. Thus, legal action in the event of default can be involved. Under an agreement for an <em>equipment lease,</em> by contrast, the equipment lessor, not the borrower, owns the equipment. The lessor remains the legal owner until the lease obligation has been satisfied in full, at which point the lessee either purchases the asset or returns it to <a id="page_211"></a>the lessor. Collection action is simpler in event of default. Because the risk is less, a lease is often easier to obtain than a purchase loan.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The cost of equipment leasing is typically higher than the cost of an equipment purchase loan, if for no other reason than there’s usually an intermediary (the lessor) between the buyer and the seller. This cost comparison rule-of-thumb is not always valid, because there are other considerations that affect cost. Tax benefits can accrue to a lessor who continues to own the equipment which might be partially passed through to the lessee/borrower, resulting in lower net lease rates. But companies looking into leasing should meet with their financial advisor and do their homework before they sign on the dotted line.</p>

<p class="noindent">Don’t believe that an equipment lease conveys unique tax benefits. It’s not true!</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>We often hear radio ads touting the tax advantages of leasing over buying—cars, for example. They tell us we can deduct the lease payments, a unique advantage over buying. Well, guess what? It’s not true.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The cost of a car—or any other asset—is tax-deductible if the asset is used for a tax-deductible purpose, regardless of how you pay for it. Any difference? In a lease you deduct the lease payments, and in a purchase you deduct the depreciation and interest. In the end, the difference to you is which one costs you more money after taxes—and that’s usually the one that cost you more money <em>before</em> taxes.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>One more variation is worth mentioning here: a <em>sale and lease-back arrangement</em>. A company that owns its equipment and property outright, but needs to raise money, can sell its equipment to a financing source and then lease it back from the source, without anything changing physically. The company sells ownership of the property and then leases it for a period of years, just as if it were an original equipment lease as we’ve already described. Since the equipment is used, the interest cost is usually higher, but the transaction effectively frees up cash invested in plant and equipment to be used for another purpose.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Small Business Administration Will Guarantee Your Loan</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">A source long known to entrepreneurs and seasoned business owners is <a id="page_212"></a>the Small Business Administration (SBA), a federal agency that exists to support the growth of small business in this country. One way the SBA does that is by helping small businesses obtain loans by guaranteeing a portion of those loans made by commercial lenders, principally banks. For the lender, this means making a loan with less risk, because the SBA guarantees a large part of it if the borrower defaults. For the borrower, this is an excellent way to get long-term, relatively inexpensive access to growth capital.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The SBA guarantees a variety of loan types for business purposes. While details of these programs are available at <em><a href="http://www.sba.gov/content/sba-loans">www.sba.gov/content/sba-loans</a>,</em> the most common among them are:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  A term loan called the <em>7(a) program,</em> which can be used for a wide variety of business start-up or expansion purposes, including the purchase of equipment, the purchase or construction of business real estate, or acquisition of a business, with negotiated fixed or variable rates and loan amounts up to a maximum of $5 million.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The <em>CDC 504 loan program,</em> available for the purchase of land, the construction or renovation of buildings, and related purposes, with fixed rates, terms up to 20 years, and a loan limit generally up to $5 million.</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The <em>Microloan program,</em> providing loans up to $50,000 for small start-ups and available through local nonprofit SBA intermediaries for terms up to six years.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>A company owner wanting to obtain long-term, lower-cost financing for an approved purpose can file an application with the SBA or, more commonly, any of the hundreds of banks designated “Preferred SBA Lender.” A small business owner has a good chance of obtaining such a loan provided the company meets the bank’s own lending standards, such as having collateral for the loan, an apparent ability to repay the loan in accordance with its terms, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Because the SBA guarantees the repayment of up to 90 percent of the loan, minimizing the bank’s risk, loan rates should be lower than those for loans lacking an SBA guarantee. Over time that has not always been the case, however, and business owners should always shop around. Most authorized banks will assist business owners with their application or <a id="page_213"></a>refer them to independent “loan packagers,” who—for a fee—will complete the lengthy application paperwork and help the borrower <em>who has not read this book</em> understand things like cash forecasts and balance sheets.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch13lev96"><strong>Convertible Debt: The Transition from Debt to Equity</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">When a company needs to raise cash, an initial choice must be made: do we borrow or do we sell stock in the company? Borrowing costs money in the form of interest payments, but selling equity dilutes the ownership interests of the present stockholders. A company in financial difficulties might have to sell a substantial piece of ownership to raise the needed funds while adequately compensating investors for taking the risk. Yet management doesn’t want to be saddled with interest payments for a long time, particularly since a downtime for a company usually means the interest rate it must pay to attract lenders is also high. What to do? (For a brief comparison of borrowing methods see, <a href="ch13.html#ch13fig2">Figure 13-2</a>.)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The answer for some companies is to sell debt that is convertible to equity at some future time when it’s beneficial to both the company and the lenders. This financing tool is called <em>convertible debt</em> or <em>convertible debentures</em>. By any name, the instrument is a convertible bond that pays the lender interest only for some period of time, thus conserving the company’s cash and enabling management to make the most of its cash resources. The lender may later choose to convert the debt into shares of stock at a predetermined conversion ratio. Result: The company stops paying high interest and surrenders a reasonable amount of ownership.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Bond</strong> A negotiable instrument that’s typically sold by public companies, which pays interest quarterly and is usually publicly traded during its life (like company stock). Bonds are not collateralized, but are often issued with insurance (purchased by the issuing company) that guarantees payment of principal and interest by an insurance company in the event the issuer defaults. This provision typically gives such bonds the highest investment grade rating because it removes essentially all ownership risk except interest rate fluctuation.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Debenture</strong> A bond that may be sold publicly or privately, but that has no collateral to back it up except the strength of the issuing company. These instruments are similar to bonds and are often enhanced by being convertible into the issuing company’s common stock under certain circumstances. Typically only the largest companies can successfully sell debentures.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_214"></a>Here’s how it works. A borrowing company issues a convertible debenture with provisions that call for interest to be paid periodically, usually quarterly, but no principal. At some future time, the bond is <em>callable,</em> meaning the company can buy it back (usually at a premium over its face value) and retire it, in effect paying off the loan. In the interim the bond can be converted into stock at any time, at a conversion rate advantageous to the borrowing company.</p>

<p class="noindent">A convertible bond is issued with a conversion price of $25, meaning that a $1,000 bond can be converted into 40 shares of stock. But when the bond is issued, the market price of the stock is only $15. The lender (the bond buyer) won’t consider converting, because buying shares on the open market would cost less than converting the bond. So the lender waits and collects interest on the loan, in this case 10 percent per year.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Over time the company prospers. The stock price rises to $30. Now the lender has a choice: collect $100 interest per year and in the future be repaid the $1,000, or convert the bond into 40 shares of stock and then sell the shares for $1,200 (40 × $30). The lender’s decision will depend on his or her individual financial objectives, but there’s a good chance the lender will convert. If so, the company ceases paying interest and does not have to repay the loan. However, it must issue 40 shares of stock to satisfy the conversion request and accept a slight dilution in its earnings per share. The lender gets a return greater than 10 percent on the money loaned. Everybody wins.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch13lev97"><strong>Capital Stock: Types and Uses</strong></h3>
<h4 class="h4a"><strong>Common Stock: Fundamental Ownership of the Corporation</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Common stock</em> is the basic form of corporation ownership. In the classic scenario, a company’s management issues stock to investors in return for their cash, then uses the cash to start and operate the business. A share of stock represents a unit of ownership in a company, but the size of that unit depends on the number of stock shares issued. A small company owned by a handful of people might only have a few hundred shares outstanding, that is, owned by its stockholders. Microsoft, by contrast, has over 5 <em>billion</em> shares outstanding. So percentage of ownership is not only about how many shares you own; it’s about how many shares everybody owns. Thus we arrive at a key observation of stock ownership: The more shares there are, the less your shares are worth. This is called dilution, as we discussed in <a href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Common stock</strong> Equity ownership in a corporation that entitles the stockholders to dividends and/or capital appreciation and the right to vote. In the event of liquidation, common stockholders have rights to corporate assets only after bondholders, other debt holders, and preferred stockholders are paid. In other words, common stockholder liquidation rights come last, after every other claim on the company’s assets. As a result, most liquidations leave common stockholders with nothing or nearly nothing.</p>

<p class="noindent">Issuing stock to raise cash helps the company, but it can hurt the shareholders.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Consider the example of Wonder Widget, our rapidly growing company. It’s publicly owned now, under the understated symbol WOWI. The company is profitable, earning $1 million in net income last year. You own 1,000 shares, out of 500,000 outstanding. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) were $2 ($1,000,000 ÷ 500,000). The market thinks WOWI’s shares are worth 20 times earnings (price/earnings ratio), meaning the company is valued at $20 million. Your shares would bring $40,000 (1,000 × $2 × 20) if you sold them today.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>But Wonder Widget is still growing, so the next year it sells more stock in a “secondary” stock offering: It sells 100,000 shares at $20 to raise $2 million in cash. WOWI is better off now, but how about you?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>You still have your 1,000 shares, and the company earns $1,050,000 that year, a 5 percent increase over the prior year. But since there are now 600,000 shares outstanding, EPS is down to $1.75 ($1,050,000 ÷ 600,000). The market still thinks the company is worth 20 times earnings, so valuation is up to $21 million (20 × $1,050,000). Your shares, however, are now worth only $35,000 (1,000 × $1.75 × 20).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The company has more cash and is making more money. You did nothing different—and lost $5,000 in market value. That, dear reader, is <em>dilution</em>.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Common stock is the basic ownership unit, as noted before. The common stockholder is the <em>residual owner</em> of the company’s assets. That means the common stockholder gets the remaining value when all the debts are settled, which may be a great deal or may be nothing. It’s this <a id="page_217"></a>risk/reward relationship that has enabled public stock ownership to become the best investment for growth in the long term—and a risky investment in the short term.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Preferred Stock: Ownership with Perks ... and Limitations</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">There’s a way for the investor to mitigate the risk without entirely losing the potential for appreciation. If a company needs additional equity capital and wants to avoid diluting the value of its common stock, it could elect to issue a separate class of shares such as preferred stock. <em>Preferred stock</em> typically carries a stated dividend rate, in terms of percent of face value or dollars per share.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-r"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Preferred stock</strong> Equity ownership in a corporation that entitles the stockholders to a specified dividend before any dividends are paid on common stock. In the event of liquidation, preferred stockholders have rights to corporate assets after bondholders and other debt holders, but before common stockholders.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Preferred shares are a separate class of stock, with privileges and restrictions different from common stock. And they’re called preferred shares for good reason. When the board of directors declares a dividend to the shareholders, the preferred shareholders must get their entire dividend, based on the stated dividend rate, before any dividends can be paid to the common shareholders. In some cases, the preferred shares are also <em>cumulative,</em> meaning that dividends not paid in one year accumulate as obligations of the company and must be paid in full before common stock dividends can be paid. For some companies, that can mean years of paying preferred dividends in full while giving common stockholders little or nothing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>For example, following the 2008 financial crisis and the federal government’s bailout of large banks, these banks were only allowed to pay common stock dividends of $0.01 per share for years. One of these, Bank of America, had 16 classes of preferred stock outstanding during this period, and the preferred stockholders got their full dividend every quarter.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In the event of a company’s dissolution, with both preferred and common shares outstanding, the cash raised from liquidating the assets <a id="page_218"></a>is first used to repay creditors. What’s left goes to the stockholders, with the preferred stockholders coming first. If there’s enough money to satisfy 100 percent of the preferred stockholders’ claims, then the balance goes to the common stockholders. If there’s insufficient cash to satisfy both groups of owners, there’s no pro-rata sharing between them. The preferred shareholders get all of theirs, and the common shareholders get what’s left, which may be nothing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>That, simply, is the meaning of the word “preferred.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Why doesn’t every investor buy only preferred stock? The downside of preferred stock ownership is the limitation on participation in the extreme good fortune of the company. If a company does very well, it can declare a handsome dividend for its common stockholders or give them additional shares (<em>stock dividends</em>) or both. Generally, however, such extras need not be paid to the preferred shareholders. The tradeoff for the preference is the restriction on enjoying the fruits of success. These restrictions have the effect of also restricting the market price appreciation of preferred shares, since they cannot participate in a company’s dynamic growth as much as common stockholders.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>One feature is sometimes added to preferred shares to offset this limitation: A company can issue <em>convertible</em> preferred stock. These shares act like preferred shares until their owners decide to convert them, under provisions similar to those built into the convertible debt discussed earlier. Once the holders convert their shares, the preference ends and they participate like other common stockholders, for better or worse. Typically, as with convertible debt, strong success is the best inducement for preferred shareholders to convert their shares. Once the preferred shares are converted, the company no longer has to reserve earnings for preferred dividends. It can pay out those dollars as common stock dividends or retain them for expansion, debt repayment, or other corporate purpose.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch13lev98"><strong>Manager’s Checklist for <a href="ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</a></strong></h3>
<p class="check-i-1"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Borrowing rule No. 1: Lending is a competitive business. Always shop for a loan, even if your favorite banker has made you an offer you think you can’t refuse, unless saving money is not an important objective.</p>
<p class="check-i"><a id="page_219"></a><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Borrowing rule No. 2: Borrow short-term money only for short-term needs. Don᾿t get caught with an overdue loan because the long-term project it was financing has taken longer than expected to pay off.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Perhaps the most expensive form of short-term borrowing is factoring, the sale of accounts receivable to a lender. Rates can go as high as 5 percent a month, and paperwork requirements are substantial.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Leasing equipment and buying equipment on installment are two ways to finance equipment acquisition. Leasing and buying differ mostly in the strength of the lien held by the lender, the size of the monthly payments, and the net borrowing cost. Again, shop around.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Dilution lowers the value of your investment even when things are going well. Pay attention to the potential dilutive effects of the actions of any company in which you hold stock. The most common examples are stock options and new stock sales.</p>
<p class="check-i-2"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Preferred stock differs from common stock in that preferred stock owners are paid dividends before common stockholders and receive similar preference in the event of liquidation. Conversely, those preferences limit preferred stock market price appreciation when the issuer’s business is successful.<a id="page_220"></a></p>
