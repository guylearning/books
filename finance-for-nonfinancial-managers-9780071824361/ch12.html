<h2 class="h2"><strong>The Annual Budget: Financing Your Plans</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><span class="ash"><strong>O</strong></span></span>nce management has decided on a business plan that sets company goals for the next year, they need to determine (a) if they can afford to achieve those goals, (b) if the plan will make a profit for the company, and (c) if the plan will meet the goals set by management. Those questions are best answered by converting the operating plan’s goals and actions into dollars and cents, then breaking down the plans into chunks that can be evaluated and managed during daily operations. That’s the purpose of the annual budget. The <em>annual budget</em> is the estimate of the financial resources that will be needed and the anticipated financial outcome of all the actions the managers will take during the budget period. The budget is also the <em>financial benchmark,</em> the report card against which their success in managing their financial resources will be measured.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The format of a typical annual budget includes a detailed, department-by-department, line-by-line, month-by-month estimate of the income and expenses that will occur if the operating plan is carried out as intended. The budget contains sufficient detail to enable department managers to allocate and manage the resources assigned to them: employees, production equipment, advertising dollars, office supplies, and so forth.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>A well-prepared budget is as detailed as necessary to track all material sources of revenue, all significant planned expenses, and the cash <a id="page_178"></a>flow effects of that activity. The budget should also include expected changes in the balance sheet as a result of the flow of money, because balance sheets are the basis for many performance measurements (as you learned in <a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>) and because they are also the tools lenders use to measure compliance with loan covenants. The annual budget is the focus of this chapter because it’s the most useful and most used of the financial estimating tools. However, it’s not the only technique for estimating the company’s financial future.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev81"><strong>Tools for Telling the Future: Budgets, Forecasts, Projections, and Tea Leaves</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">There are lots of labels you may hear for financial plans. Some folks will tell you this or that is the “correct” name for the plan. But it matters less what you call it and more what you intend to do with it. Whether you call your plan a budget, a forecast, or a projection—it doesn’t matter to the company owners as long as you hit it on the money. (Of course, if you call your plan “tea leaves,” you may have a credibility problem, even if you achieve great results.) Most of these words differ principally in the level of detail they contain, the depth of work that went into their preparation, and the period of time they cover. Still, it’s worthwhile to know the most common usage, if for no other reason than because they are the definitions we use in this book.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Financial plan</strong> The generic label for any kind of future estimate in financial terms. Budgets, forecasts, and projections are all financial plans. Aside from the generic usage, <em>financial plan</em> is most often used for a long-term business plan that identifies the financial effects of all the plan’s activities. In <a href="ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</a> we referred to the dollars-and-cents representation of our long-range plan as a financial plan. The resulting definition: an integrated, multiyear plan of income, expenses, cash flow, and balance sheet changes.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Projection</strong> An estimate that’s less detailed than a financial plan and usually covers a shorter period. Typically a projection is prepared to demonstrate expected financial results over a few months or a year, perhaps for a special purpose such as a bank loan or to test the continuing validity of a budget or long-range plan. A projection may not include an integrated balance sheet, but it almost always includes a P&amp;L projection or a cash flow projection, depending on the focus.</p>
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Forecast</strong> Typically a short-term view of the next few weeks or months, perhaps to test the validity of the operating budget under a set of conditions that might not have existed when the annual budget was created. Short-term cash forecasts are typically not very detailed. A forecast might also be used as the starting point in budgeting, such as producing a sales forecast that forms the basis for the sales budget.</p>

<p class="noindent">Forecasts are often prepared by companies that don’t use annual budgets, often employed when management finds they need a tool to help them see into the immediate future. This might be the case in a company with short-term cash flow problems. Small businesses may use forecasting when executives don’t appreciate the value of a formal planning system (a risky situation), yet recognize from time to time that they can’t mentally assimilate all the factors that will influence their immediate financial future.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev82"><strong>How to Budget for Revenues: The “Unpredictable” Starting Point</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">For valid reasons, every budget preparation cycle should begin with a revenue forecast. Revenue typically drives the business and determines the level of growth and the degree of success that the business may anticipate. The level of revenue determines the magnitude of investment that management can make in the business, as well as the resources they may need to purchase to run the business.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>For many managers, preparing a budget is a frustrating activity. Not only must they take the time to prepare a budget, but they have to start with the one thing they can neither control nor accurately predict: the amount of products and services their customers will buy from them during the budget period. Still, that’s how it’s done, except in the smallest of companies or companies with aging owners who have become highly risk-averse or some professional service firms where the primary focus is on covering fixed costs. Such narrowly focused thinking is inconsistent with building a successful, forward-looking company, but for owners these limited approaches represent protecting what they have, a primary concern.</p>

<p class="side-title"><strong>T<small>HE</small> S<small>ALESPEOPLE</small> K<small>NOW</small> B<small>EST</small>!</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Whatever the company’s structure, the sales forecast should come from the people directly responsible for bringing in the sales, the company’s sales force. Salespeople typically know the market better than anyone else. While senior management may feel it’s important to announce their sales desires, hopes, and expectations, building those goals into the company budget without validation from the people who sell the goods or services is risky. They know what customers want and don’t want, even if they don’t always communicate it effectively to management. Besides, the salespeople must buy into the sales budget, just as any employees should take personal responsibility for any goal assigned to them. Otherwise, they may well consider it “management’s budget” and not theirs, with the likely result being failure to achieve the plan.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>This approach does have some risks, however. Salespeople may want to set less aggressive sales goals because they don’t want to be evaluated against a target they’re not sure they can hit or because they want to be assigned a target they are certain they can meet or exceed. Also, if your salespeople are primarily outside sales representatives rather than employees, their sense of your market and their commitment to the company may influence the care with which they prepare their estimates. However, these risks don’t lessen the importance of having the salespeople adopt the sales forecast as their own.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>If we accept the value of beginning with a sales forecast, the next question is usually: How do we do it? How to budget for revenues depends in large measure on the nature of the business, its history, and customer buying patterns. <a href="ch12.html#ch12fig1">Figure 12-1</a> shows some ideas and the kinds of businesses for which they might make sense.</p>

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 12-1.</strong> Estimating revenues</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The completed sales estimate is then presented to management, who evaluates its viability in terms of:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  A reasonable balance between aggressiveness and conservatism. Did the sales manager push for more than was easily attainable without creating expectations that no one can reasonably meet?</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The likely acceptance of the estimate by the salespeople, balanced against the company’s ability to make an acceptable profit if the estimate is adopted and met.</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The abilities and resources available to the production side of the company to deliver the goods and services outlined in the estimate.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>If the sales estimate is deemed acceptable, it becomes the company’s sales budget. All other budgets will then have to take into account the resources they’ll need to support the sales budget. If the sales budget is not yet acceptable, it likely means a back-and-forth process of questions, additional research, and negotiations between management and the <a id="page_182"></a>sales organization until an acceptable revenue budget is adopted. If this process is normal, it should be considered in developing the timetable for budget preparation.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev83"><strong>Budgeting Costs: Understanding Relationships That Affect Costs</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Budgeting,</em> in its simplest form, is an attempt to estimate what will happen to a company’s financial condition if it sells a certain quantity of goods and services and runs its business in support of that sales result. Managers want to know what they will have to spend in the coming year to sell the quantities they have budgeted and exactly what they will spend it for. This sounds simple enough—except for this principle, perhaps an obscure extension of Parkinson’s Law: There is always a good reason to spend money. (Parkinson’s Law [Wikipedia]: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>As Parkinson might have said it, the need for money expands to consume all available funds. In other words, there’s always a logical reason to approve a given expenditure. Every department needs more resources to do its job—or at least that case can always be made and apparently supported. Most companies today try to get by with lower costs than previously, as a hedge against the possibility that sales or profits will be lower than planned. Whether an expenditure will deliver the expected benefit is a big question, of course, but a manager can’t know the answer with certainty until he or she makes the expenditure, so it’s hard to disapprove an expenditure in advance unless it violates some predetermined standard, like the budget.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Given that premise, managers can choose to accept every rationale put forward by an employee that seems logical, or they can spend time and resources to audit the validity of every request to spend money, or they can simply make arbitrary choices until they run out of money. Since none of those options is wise in today’s business environment, senior managers must find a way to relate the need to spend money to what’s really needed to support their sales goals, their R&amp;D goals, their expansion goals, or whatever their operating plan calls for as the measure of success for the coming year.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_183"></a>Enter the budget: a planning and analysis tool that enables management to estimate the expenditures needed to support a given level of sales and to set spending limits based on those estimates. Remember that some expenses are variable with sales, some are fixed, and some are somewhere between variable and fixed (semi-fixed). You can begin to see the possibility that we can create a budget that documents those relationships, thus setting limits on reasonable spending for potentially every item in the company’s chart of accounts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>We already know that variable costs grow or shrink in direct relation to sales levels. If you think about it, though, many other cost items in a budget have identifiable relationships to other cost items, not only to sales. Those relationships enable a company to base its spending decisions on its own operating history.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>For example, assume that last year’s group medical insurance cost the company 2 percent of wages paid, and the insurer has announced a 10 percent rate increase for the coming year. It makes sense to build a budget that includes health insurance at 2.2 percent of budgeted labor costs for next year (10 percent more than last year’s 2 percent), comfortable in the knowledge that the relationship will hold at almost any labor level. Now the company doesn’t have to reconsider healthcare costs with every budget revision. It can allow budgeted health insurance costs to follow budgeted wages, which are controllable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a href="ch12.html#ch12fig2">Figure 12-2</a> shows a few relationships that may help a company develop a budget with built-in cost controls that might otherwise be difficult to estimate, based on their relationship to other, more visible costs.</p>
<div class="group">
<p class="fig-img"><a id="ch12fig2"></a><a id="page_184"></a><img src="f0202-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="546" height="694"/></p>
<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 12-2.</strong> Cost relationships that facilitate sound budgeting</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>You can probably think of more of these relationships that would apply to your company’s budget, but this gives you an idea of the possibilities. Keep in mind that a budgeted line item based on a percent of sales—when the activity bears no direct relation to sales—is a waste of time as a control tool. That becomes a calculation without accuracy and without value, other than to fill a space in the budget file. Look for the relationships that have meaning, even if the basis for a predominantly fixed cost is only last year’s actual expense plus an inflation factor (as it might be, for example, when budgeting for building rent).</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev84"><strong>The Budgeting Process: Trial and Error</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You’ve exerted diligent effort, honestly given your department’s budget your best sense of accuracy, and provided for every cost you think might be incurred to meet the goals you’ve been assigned. You feel confident as you send your budget to your boss. (You’re the first of her direct reports to get yours in—another feather in your cap.) You wait for the feedback after all the other departments submit their budgets and all the departments, divisions, and cost center budgets are combined into a total company draft plan.</p>

<p class="noindent">For many years companies have used spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel®, to build their budgets, manipulate the numbers for presentation, develop alternative versions, and insert the countless changes that come out of the negotiations inherent in the process. Two problems that users face with these traditional tools are the lack of flexibility of such models and the high risk of error caused by the need to make multiple entries for each change, requiring the data entry person to remember everywhere in the model a given change has impact. Since most such models are built by the company’s Finance Department staff, the strength of the design to overcome these challenges varies widely. While large companies could purchase high-powered software with built-in safeguards, until recently few affordable options were available for small and midsized companies.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In the past few years a range of software products has arisen to fill that gap. The Excel spreadsheet format is quickly being replaced by more sophisticated interfaces that are better able to make real-time use of external databases and general ledger information, the mainstays of today’s midlevel and enterprise organizations. In addition, the move to Software as a Service and other cloud-based platforms means updates to these products can be made continuously, collaboration and error-checking are easier, and security is substantially enhanced. Small and midsized companies can usually get solid recommendations from their CPA or a number of Web-based review sites for such products.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Imagine how you’d feel if the next thing you heard was your manager telling you that you need to cut 10 percent from your budget, without any reduction in the goals for which you will be held accountable. If you’ve been in the corporate world for any time, you know this is common. But why? If everyone else did his or her part as diligently as you, this wouldn’t happen, would it?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Well, actually, it might.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The process of producing a companywide budget involves various departments estimating the resources they feel they will need to meet their goals—sales targets, customer service response rates, launch of new <a id="page_186"></a>products or services, Marketing Department development of new collateral materials for trade shows, etc. No one knows what the total of all those cost budgets will be until they’re merged. Only then can management get the first sense of whether their sales and profit goals are likely to be met by the combined budget submissions. If they do, approval is all that’s necessary to make the draft the new, official budget. But more often they don’t, at least not at first.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In fulfilling their responsibilities to the owners or stockholders, management must ask everyone to take another look at his or her proposal and find ways to raise revenues (again) or reduce expenses (again) to improve the budgeted bottom line. This is exactly the back-and-forth process that occurred earlier with the revenue budget. The objective is to achieve a happy medium in which management is satisfied with the sales and profit commitments of the organization, and managers with budget responsibility are comfortable that they can achieve the assigned goals with the budgeted resources.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>During such reassessment, managers might look to ideas such as these to reevaluate their cost requests:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Operate with the minimum number of employees that can handle the work.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Train workers better to improve productivity and reduce turnover.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Reduce operating costs, such as by using automation to save on labor costs.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Perform a lease vs. buy analysis before acquiring new equipment (note that this also has cash flow implications, another consideration for growing companies).</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Negotiate better prices and terms with suppliers and develop alternate suppliers.</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Plan more use of overtime to reduce the need to hire more permanent workers (although the cost in terms of overtime premium somewhat reduces the savings from this option).</p>

<p class="noindent">Senior management, by mandating a cut of a certain percentage across all departments, may do more than create a furor; they can also cause serious, lasting damage. What does a savvy manager do who anticipates an order to reduce by 5 percent across the board? He or she raises all figures by 5 percent. So management gains nothing—unless it orders a 10 percent reduction. And a savvy manager who is unsure about the percentage to be applied would likely pad the budget for a worst-case scenario.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The result is that the managers are playing cat-and-mouse “negotiation” games with the figures, wasting a lot of time and effort simply because senior management prefers making budget cuts the easy way. Good managers make hard, individual budget decisions for the good of the company.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In a company where budget decisions are controlled by senior management, the negotiation process may be simply an edict to every department to “cut 10 percent.” In 1967, when Ronald Reagan became governor of California, he created a furor when he did exactly that in trying to balance the state’s budget. He soon had to relent and find a more nuanced way to reduce costs. But the lesson Reagan learned was lost on many corporate managers, perhaps because an across-the-board cut avoids making hard, individual decisions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In a more empowering management environment, senior management asks subordinates to remove more money from less critical functions and less from the more critical departments. This process takes longer and involves more back-and-forth, trial-and-error manipulation of the numbers. But it usually results in a more credible budget that’s easier for subordinates to buy into, rather than the alternative—acceptance of the edict from above, all the while holding the quiet belief that “it will take a lot of luck to make these numbers.”</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev85"><strong>Flexible Budgets: Whatever Happens, We’ve Got a Budget for It</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the most useful tools in the manufacturing environment, and in many other kinds of companies as well, is the <em>flexible budget</em>. This tool is an extension of the classic budgeting methodology that is most valuable when these two statements are both true:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_188"></a><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  The company expects or may experience wide variations in activity levels within some area of the company, such as sales.</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Many significant costs vary directly with those levels of activity, e.g., they are direct costs tied to sales, and the budget controls for these costs would be nearly useless if activity levels were significantly different from those in the budget.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>In this situation, it’s wise to develop a flexible budget, in which directly related costs are budgeted for various activity levels, and the budget used for comparison with actual results is the budget that’s based on the actual activity levels achieved.</p>
<p class="none"> </p>
<div class="sidebar-ash">
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
<p class="image-b"><img src="keyterm.jpg" alt="Image" width="93" height="80"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Flexible budget</strong> A set of revenue and expense projections at various production or sales levels. Because the projections are based on different levels of activity, a flexible budget is useful in specifying the resources needed for various production levels (e.g., to manufacture product to respond to an unexpected 20 percent favorable variance in sales) without having to revise the budget or incur needed budget variances to support the new sales level. A series of budgets can be readily developed to fit any activity level.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>How does a flexible budget work? Let’s assume the Wonder Widget Company projects sales and production of its WW-1000 at 500 units a month. With a strong sales effort on the one hand, or inefficiency or production problems on the other, volume could be anywhere from 300–600 units, a big variation for which to plan. Such fluctuations could significantly impair budget analysis.</p>

Unhappy customers might be inclined to cancel their unfilled orders, resulting in lost sales and unhappiness all around. By contrast, if the company sold only 400 units when the plant was budgeted to make 500, production could be inefficient yet not exceed the budget, with a negative impact on profits even though expenditures could still be under budget.</p>

<p class="noindent">If you look closely at <a href="ch12.html#ch12fig4">Figure 12-4</a>, and in particular the unit costs for budgeted vs. actual production, you’ll notice that the budgeted unit labor cost was $65 per unit ($32,500 ÷ 500) but the actual labor cost came out to $71.25 per unit ($28,500 ÷ 400). How can that be when the costs vary with production quantities? The answer is that labor is inefficient when it doesn’t function at the levels for which the workforce was designed. The labor force in this case didn’t use its time efficiently, but still got paid for the time spent. The result: The actual direct labor cost incurred was more per unit than budgeted.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Looking at the variable overhead, a similar situation exists. Budgeted overhead per unit was $150, but actual overhead was $160. Since overhead allocation typically follows labor cost, this increase resulted from allocating overhead to the inefficient labor that was charged but produced nothing.</p>
<div class="none"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The combination of the underproduction and the use of a flexible budget convey a very different and more informative picture.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>As you can see, the Production Department’s efficiency is better measured with the flexible budget, which shows it actually exceeded the budget by $6,500 for the level of results it delivered. That information would have been lost if a static budget had been used. That’s why flexible budgets are smart when management wants to create a budget that doesn’t reward the underspending that typically accompanies underproduction.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>While flexible (or “flex”) budgeting is more effort to prepare, it’s more effective in the right circumstances. Of course, the reverse is also true. If conditions don’t vary greatly, such as in an administrative department with largely fixed costs, a flex budget would simply be a lot more work for little benefit.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev86"><a id="page_191"></a><strong>How to Live Within Your Budget</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">As noted earlier, when lacking a budget, there’s always a good reason to spend money. However, once you have a budget, that argument is invalid and your spending level is always within the budget—not! Having a budget is the first step. Managing to it is the second and more critical step. This concept is right up there with the idea that a plan is worthless unless you actually use it. Later in this chapter we cover what to do when spending differs from the budget, but here I want to offer some thoughts about avoiding that discussion entirely. Here are five proven ideas for living within that budget so you don’t have to explain later why you didn’t.</p>
<p class="num-list-t"><span class="none">  </span>1. “Oops!” is not a good explanation for overspending. The easiest way to live within your budget is to look at it before you reach for your credit card or purchase order. The objective is to see how much money is actually planned for whatever you want to buy and in which time period the purchase was planned. If you know you’ve budgeted $500 for office supplies in May, you should think twice before spending $1,000 for office supplies that month. You may still decide to proceed, but you’ll have a reason for doing so other than “Oh, I didn’t know that.”</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>2. If you must spend money for something that’s not in the budget, remove or postpone a like amount of money from something else in the budget. In other words, make a trade-off with something you planned for that can be postponed, so your bottom line comes out even. Spend more here, spend less there, because almost never does every dollar have to be spent when you planned it.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>3. Negotiate a price with vendors whenever their current price is more than you budgeted. A perfectly reasonable defense in negotiation is the truthful statement “That’s all I have in my budget this month.” That strategy is neither unfair nor illegal; it’s a negotiating strategy. A supplier who wants the business may be flexible on price to get the order, and if not and you must have it now—and you’re authorized to exceed budget if necessary—you have a reason to go ahead with the purchase.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_192"></a>4. If company revenue doesn’t develop as planned, compensate by underspending accordingly. The budget is ultimately about the bottom line. If revenue is less than planned, you likely don’t need as much expense to support it. So find what was planned to support the revenue that didn’t come in and don’t spend it.</p>
<p class="num-list"><span class="none">  </span>5. Timing is not trivial. Don’t spend ahead of schedule. It can wreak havoc with the cash flow budget that may have been carefully laid out to avoid a cash squeeze. If you must spend before you planned to, postpone something else in the same time period until you can catch up. This is another trade-off that keeps the bottom line on track and you out of the penalty box.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev87"><strong>Variance Reporting and Taking Action</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a> we explored variances from standard manufacturing cost and how they help us identify and correct production inefficiencies. When standard costing methodology is used in the manufacturing environment, standard cost is, in effect, the budget for making a single unit of product. Nonmanufacturing companies and the other departments in a manufacturing company don’t use standard costs per se, but they all use budgets, and for them, variance analysis serves the same purpose.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Variance reporting is a variant of the traditional management concept of <em>management by exception</em> (see <a href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>). Variance reporting enables managers to more rapidly and efficiently locate and correct problems by creating reports that focus primarily on the problems, or exceptions. The report is formatted to calculate and highlight differences between actual and budgeted costs. <a href="ch12.html#ch12fig6">Figure 12-6</a> shows an example of such a report for Wonder Widget’s Sales &amp; Marketing Department.</p>

<p class="fig-cap"><strong>Figure 12-6.</strong> Wonder Widget departmental budget variance report</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>Unfavorable numbers in variance columns appear in parentheses. The format facilitates quick review and recognition of the numbers that are out of bounds or over budget. Some reports might also include columns for variance percent, to show each variance as a percentage of the budget for that line item. Again, the idea is to easily identify the significant differences, so management can move immediately to take corrective action. A report such as this should be prepared monthly for every department and for the company as a whole to help everyone manage to the profit goals.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev88"><strong>The Capital Expenditure Budget</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">While not exactly the same kind of budget this chapter has focused on so far, capital expenditure is another area that needs an approved budget but that doesn’t appear in the operating budget we’ve been discussing. That’s because capital expenditures aren’t income or expense items. As noted in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="ch06.html#ch06">6</a>, capital assets aren’t expensed when purchased; rather, they’re capitalized and depreciated over time. While that depreciation is normally included in the operating budget, the amounts intended to be spent on new capital assets during the year are not.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>For proper management control of planned expenditures, the capital assets the company plans to buy must be built into a separate, capital asset budget that indicates the kind of asset, its estimated cost, and when during the year it will be purchased. This enables the company to fully control its cash expenditure plans, both expense and capital, through the budget process. In this way, cash (or borrowing capacity) is available when needed and management has the opportunity to review and approve capital asset purchases just as it does the budget for income and expenses.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev89"><a id="page_194"></a><strong>The Cash Flow Budget</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The point has been made often in this book that everything ultimately boils down to cash. If you have more cash coming to you than you had when you started—and you don’t have less of something else offsetting the cash gain—you’ve won the game, so to speak. But our budget at this point has been about budgeting income and expenses using the accrual method of accounting, not the cash method. In other words, our income and expense budget shows income when it’s earned (not when customers pay for their purchases) and expenses when they are incurred (not when they’re paid for). Careful readers will recognize that the profit or loss Wonder Widget’s income and expense budget produces won’t manifest itself in its bank account due to the differences between cash and accrual accounting discussed in <a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>If “cash is king,” our budget isn’t complete without including a plan for cash flow as well as income and expenses. The cash flow budget should include all the elements in the income and expense budget, all the capital transactions outlined in the capital expenditures budget, and all other transactions not appearing in either budget, such as borrowing or loan repayments, dividend payments to stockholders, etc. The cash flow budget should incorporate those elements into a cohesive plan for cash that covers the entire period of the budget.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>The most useful format for a cash budget is the format of the cash flow statement described in <a href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>. Referring to <a href="ch06.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>, recall that the cash flow statement begins where the income statement ends, at the net income line. Following the logic of the cash flow statement, each element of the overall plan that increases or decreases cash should appear in the cash flow budget, concluding at the bottom of the budget with two key numbers: the budgeted change in cash and the resulting budgeted ending cash balance.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>It’s easy to see why these are critical numbers to calculate and react to. A budget that shows any month-end with a negative cash balance presents an immediate call to action for management. Because the company can’t operate without cash, something has to change to eliminate negative cash balances or cash balances that are too low to sustain normal operations before the critical moment arrives. The income and <a id="page_195"></a>expense budget may produce acceptable results, but if the overall plan results in an unacceptable cash balance during the year, management can’t approve that budget until the cash shortfall has been resolved. Resolution can come in the form of:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Revising the income and expense budget to lower or adjust the timing of expenses, or perhaps changing the timing of a sales campaign to bring in revenue sooner;</p>
<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Adjusting the timing or payment source of capital expenditures, e.g., borrowing instead of paying cash; or</p>
<p class="list-box-2"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Ensuring adequate borrowing capacity to provide a source of cash to carry the company through the low point until cash is restored to an appropriate level.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>When the net income projection and the cash projection are acceptable, the budget is ready for management approval. Well, almost. The next and final step is integrating the budgets with the balance sheet.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev90"><strong>Integrating the Entire Operating Budget</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Referring to <a href="ch02.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>, recall the interrelationship of the income statement, the cash flow statement, and the balance sheet. It’s not too much of a reach to see that same relationship in the annual budget as well. In fact that’s the final step in building the operating plan: integrating all the elements we’ve now completed into the balance sheet so we can see their impact on the overall value of the business.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span>You might ask why we would care. We have our income and expense budget, our cash flow budget, and our capital expenditure budget. Isn’t that all we need to move the company toward its operating plan objectives for the year? If you’re asking that, take another look at <a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, “Key Performance Indicators.” In the first few pages of that chapter, I discussed the reasons for KPIs and all the constituencies who are interested in them. If you review that chapter, you’ll note that many of the metrics outlined there come from the balance sheet and others come from merging data from the income statement and the balance sheet. So if we don’t have an integrated budget balance sheet, how will we know if our budget is going to produce positive or not-so-positive KPIs? The answer, of course, is we won’t.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="none">  </span><a id="page_196"></a>The beauty of this requirement to calculate KPIs for your budget is that you’ve already developed virtually all the pieces needed for this last step. If your company is using either an integrated Excel budgeting model, as our smaller clients do, or any of the more sophisticated budget-building applications, the design of the model does this last step automatically.</p>

<p class="noindent">A department manager should look at his or her variance report each month and ask these questions:</p>
<p class="list-box-1"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  Why did this variance occur?

<p class="list-box"><span class="none">  </span><span><img src="box.jpg" alt="Image" width="8" height="8"/></span>  What action must I take now, immediately, to keep a negative variance from continuing or to keep a positive variance from skipping away?</p>

<p class="num-list-b"><span class="none">  </span>2. The manager’s boss is likely to ask the same questions, one way or another, and it’s useful to have the answers in advance, if the manager is career-minded—or just interested in surviving.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev91"><strong>Manager’s Checklist for <a href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapter 12</a></strong></h3>
<p class="check-i-1"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Every budget development cycle should begin with an estimate of the revenues the company expects to earn. While this may first be announced as a management goal, it’s critical for the Sales Department to accept as its own whatever sales budget is adopted. That usually occurs when it’s directly involved in the revenue budget development process.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> There’s always a seemingly good reason to spend money. Budget developers and approvers must always keep in mind the company’s operating goals for the period under review and not allow a “good reason” to permit a budgeted expenditure that’s not in the best interests of meeting those goals.</p>
<p class="check-i"><a id="page_197"></a><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Budget preparation is a trial-and-error process, because we’re bringing together information from diverse sources to work toward a company goal. The chances of hitting that target on the first try are slim, so managers should expect to rework the budget at least once and accept the frustration of repeating their efforts because a good budget is worth the work.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Flexible budgets are an excellent tool for organizations, with outcomes and costs that can vary widely. Management uses a flex budget when it wants to create a budget that doesn’t reward the underspending that typically accompanies underproduction. A flex budget enables adjustment of cost budgets to align with various levels of productivity, thus letting management measure efficiency at the actual level of activity.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Capital assets to be purchased during the budget period should be budgeted as to type, amount, and timing, just as with any other demand on the company’s resources.</p>
<p class="check-i"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Every operating budget should include a cash flow plan to ensure that all intended activities for the year produce and maintain an acceptable cash level so the company can conduct its business without either running low on cash or having excess cash balances that aren’t being put to work.</p>
<p class="check-i-2"><img src="tickmark.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="23"/> Remember these magic questions for getting the most benefit from budget variance reports:</p>
<p class="list-box-i"><span class="none">      </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  Why did it happen?</p>
<p class="list-box-i"><span class="none">      </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  What immediate action should we take?</p>
<p class="list-box-i"><span class="none">      </span><span><img src="square.jpg" alt="Image" width="9" height="9"/></span>  What are we learning that will make the next budget a better management tool?<a id="page_198"></a></p>
