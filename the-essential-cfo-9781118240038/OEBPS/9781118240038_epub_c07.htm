<p class="chaptertitle">Identifying Acquisition Candidates</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT determinant of success in an acquisition program is identifying attractive candidates in the first place. If a potential transaction does not make strategic and business sense, it's highly unlikely to create shareholder value—no matter what price is paid or how well it's executed.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c07-1">RATIONALE FOR ACQUISITIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A threshold question is <span class="italic">Why pursue mergers and acquisitions?</span> Do they make any sense as a business strategy? CFOs should ponder this question carefully before embarking on an acquisition program. The skeptics abound, and CFOs will need to have a firm grasp of their rationale for pursuing them.</p>
<p class="para">At the outset, they should acknowledge that many academic and market commentators have argued that acquisitions have a high failure rate, often destroying shareholder value. Indeed, the empirical evidence indicates that while acquisitions generally create net value, the benefits obtained by the acquirer often are outweighed by the premium it has paid to the target's shareholders. Also, the skeptics rightly point out that their execution is fraught with risks that range from failing to identify potential liabilities, to underestimating the degree of difficulty in melding two disparate cultures, to creating conflicts in distribution channels and customer relationships.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, CFOs should recognize that while strategic transactions admittedly are difficult to execute, this is likewise true with alternative growth strategies—such as investing in research and development or launching new products—and that very few companies have achieved long-term success without using acquisitions to advance their strategic objectives. The fact is that acquisitions often represent a <span class="italic">faster, cheaper, and less risky</span> alternative to organic expansion.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, although CFOs are wise to view acquisitions with caution, they should focus their efforts on maximizing the probability of success, rather than eschewing acquisitions altogether. In particular, CFOs can mitigate the risks by following <span class="italic">rigorous business practices</span> in their review of potential transactions and applying <span class="italic">consistent procedures</span> in their execution.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, they can implement proven strategies for identifying potential targets, including sticking to adjacent spaces, taking a portfolio approach, requiring a business sponsor, and exercising patience and flexibility.<a id="c07-not-0001-1" href="#c07-not-0001"><span class="superscript">1</span></a></p>
<p class="h1" id="c07-2">ADJACENT SPACES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The odds of success are much greater when the acquirer pursues adjacencies—<span class="italic">logical extensions</span> of a company's current business mix that can be taken on incrementally. In contrast, diversifying into a new area often does not create value; these types of transactions are inherently more difficult to execute, and they typically lack sufficient synergies to justify the premium paid to the acquired company. Furthermore, shareholders usually can more efficiently obtain most of the benefits from diversification through the construction of their own investment portfolios—and can achieve this diversification without paying a premium.</p>
<p class="para">Adjacent acquisitions take advantage of a company's <span class="italic">intrinsic strengths</span>—management knowhow, customer insights, and cultural orientation—and also have the advantage of being <span class="italic">brand consistent.</span> Furthermore, a company can more easily communicate the strategic rationale for an adjacent acquisition than one that takes the company far afield from its current business mix. When a deal does not require a stretch of the imagination, it is easier to gain buy-in from investors, customers, and employees—which can make a real difference in the transaction's ultimate success.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c07-3">PORTFOLIO APPROACH</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A company is more likely to be a successful acquirer if it has <span class="italic">accumulated experience</span> in making deals. This argues for several smaller transactions versus a bet-the-company deal, especially if the company's acquisition program is in its nascent stages or if the acquirer is expanding into unfamiliar territory.</p>
<p class="para">Moreover, doing several transactions can produce <span class="italic">more predictable financial results</span> over time. Diversification offsets the probability that a few of the transactions will go awry and can give acquirers offsetting exposures to acquisition targets that are in differing phases of their growth cycles—with some acquisitions providing immediately attractive returns on investment and others requiring a longer period of gestation to realize their ultimately favorable levels of profitability.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, the counterargument to a portfolio approach is that it is just as hard—if not harder—to execute a small deal as a large one; thus, an acquirer should focus its resources on transactions that have greater upside potential. Certainly this argument has some validity, and doing too many small deals can be a recipe for chaos, especially if the acquirer doesn't enforce stringent guidelines for their integration.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should seek to find the golden mean, where a company can learn through the process of executing several transactions, but not to become so diffused and unfocused as to negate the discipline that's required for long-term success.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c07-4">BUSINESS SPONSOR</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">While CFOs undoubtedly should expect to play a strong leadership role in executing a company's acquisition program, they should not be the driving force for a transaction. Instead, it should be axiomatic that the CEO or a business leader takes <span class="italic">ownership</span> for the acquisition—including accountability for delivering the business results and projected synergies. This leadership is absolutely imperative and should be one of the key criteria that CFOs use to evaluate whether potential transactions are likely to create rather than destroy shareholder value.</p>
<p class="para">Likewise, although bankers or consultants can be fertile sources of transaction ideas and market intelligence, CFOs should never rely on these outsiders to determine the desirability of a potential transaction or the price to be paid. Instead, the transaction should be proposed and driven by a business sponsor who is fully committed to the strategic and business objectives to be attained and <span class="italic">personally accountable</span> for the transaction—from start to finish.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, in addition to being accountable, the business sponsor ideally should be <span class="italic">passionate</span> about the transaction. Doing acquisitions is tough work—especially after the deal closes and the integration begins. Therefore, CFOs should take comfort when a transaction has a sponsor whose passion can overcome the inevitable ebbs and flows of a combination. Conversely, a lack of passion should be a warning flag that however appealing a transaction may look on paper, the execution and follow-through may not go as planned.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c07-5">PATIENCE AND FLEXIBILITY</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Of all the reasons why companies undertake transactions that destroy shareholder value, the most common is that they are <span class="italic">too anxious</span> to do the deal. Similar to shopping for groceries when you are hungry, you can end up buying too much of the wrong things. For example, if a company is having difficulty with a particular business unit, trying to fix it through an acquisition is seldom the right course of action. The company usually will be much better off to divest the business, or to fix it first before considering an acquisition. Too often, adding an acquisition to a troubled business simply makes it a larger problem.</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, if a company is <span class="italic">too fixated</span> on pursuing a strategic objective or too narrow in its consideration of potential alternatives, it can end up buying the wrong company or paying too much. Patience is indeed a virtue in considering acquisitions, as is the flexibility to say no. That's why CFOs will often describe their acquisition strategy as “opportunistic,” which is a way to signal to investors that the company will be patient in contemplating acquisitions and will not undertake transactions unless all the stars are aligned.</p>
<p class="para">Investment bankers have an expression for this patient and flexible approach to acquisitions: “<span class="italic">Wait for another bus.</span>” CFOs are wise to heed this advice.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c07-6">STRATEGIC PURPOSE</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Although CFOs are ultimately responsible for analyzing the financial valuation of the acquisition candidate and whether it's likely to add shareholder value, they can make an even bigger contribution by ensuring that the transaction makes sense from a non-financial viewpoint. Somewhat paradoxically, CFOs should be obsessed from the outset on the strategic purpose rather than on the financials—making sure that the transaction is driven by business and strategic objectives and not as an exercise in financial engineering.</p>
<p class="para">To this end, rather than focusing initially on the financial attributes of a potential acquisition, the CFO should seek to clarify the strategic rationale—to articulate clearly and persuasively the reasons that the transaction has business logic. To this end, CFOs should be able to answer two overarching questions: <span class="italic">Why are we the most logical acquirer</span>? and <span class="italic">How will this transaction advance our strategic objectives?</span></p>
<p class="para">Only after CFOs can answer these threshold questions convincingly, should they turn to the projected financial impacts of the proposed transaction—to confirm that it makes economic as well as strategic and business sense. This requires stepping back from the specifics of the transaction and focusing on the basic objectives being pursued—in other words, clarifying the underlying strategic rationale for the transaction.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c07-7">TYPES OF ACQUISITIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">It usually helps to consider the rationale within the broad categories that describe the types of acquisitions that can be pursued: consolidations, bolt-ons, platforms, and transformations.</p>
<p class="h2">Consolidation Transactions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">“Consolidations” usually reflect a recurring business pattern whereby an industry matures and then the industry participants seek increased market share and efficiencies through combinations with each other. The consolidations can occur through mergers between major companies (such as the recent experience in the banking and telecom industries) or through a roll-up of smaller companies in a fragmented industry (such as the consolidation trends in the printing and other service industries). Consolidations may reflect cross-border synergies on a global scale, or they may be contained within a specific country or geographical region.</p>
<p class="para">Although consolidations generally have ample potential to produce efficiencies through greater economies of scale, they also can be difficult to execute due to the incompatibility of cultures, information technology systems, or compensation and benefits programs; and they often are accompanied by revenue dis-synergies as customers choose to maintain a diversity of choices among their suppliers. Also, to obtain regulatory approvals, the acquirer may be required to divest some of the operations, thereby losing a portion of the projected benefits from the transaction.</p>
<p class="para">Most important, consolidation transactions often involve excessive premiums that are paid by the acquirer; this may compel the acquirer to make overly aggressive assumptions for the projected benefits in order to justify the price paid to the target's shareholders—making it more likely that the deal won't live up to expectations.</p>
<p class="para">To facilitate consolidations that make economic sense, an acquirer may attempt to accomplish a “<span class="italic">merger of equals</span>” whereby a relatively low premium is paid to the acquired company's shareholders, typically in a stock-for-stock transaction. However, negotiating these types of transactions can be problematic due to “social” issues: Who is the CEO? Where is the headquarters? What is the company's name? Who are the board members? What are the brand names? Moreover, agreeing to a relatively low premium may induce interlopers to make a competitive offer at a higher price. Furthermore, a merger of equals can create ambiguities in the integration of the companies, causing delays in execution and a failure to realize all of the projected synergies from the combination.</p>
<p class="para">If a company is going to pursue a consolidation transaction, it should have a vision concerning the future dynamics of the industry. And if it believes that industry consolidation is inevitable, it can consider four primary alternatives:</p><div class="list"><div class="item1">1. <span class="bold">Do not participate in consolidation transactions:</span> This allows the company to maintain focus on increasing its standalone value, but may make it more difficult to compete effectively as the industry consolidates.
</div>
<div class="item1">2. <span class="bold">Agree to be acquired at a premium price for shareholders:</span> This alternative usually maximizes the short-term valuation, but may not be the best long-term alternative for creating shareholder value.
</div>
<div class="item1">3. <span class="bold">Acquire other industry participants:</span> This allows the company to strengthen its competitive position, giving it more economies of scale and market clout. This alternative may work out well in the end, but it also may cause some short-term pain for shareholders due to the premiums paid in the acquisitions and the difficulties in realizing projected synergies.
</div>
<div class="item1">4. <span class="bold">Be a consolidator now and an acquired company later:</span> This strategy maintains flexibility concerning the ultimate industry configuration and balances some short-term pain with an expectation for an eventual payoff. However, it's a difficult strategy to communicate and execute, and may be considered more of a fallback approach if the company's acquisitions don't create value.
</div>

</div>

<p class="para">CFOs can help a company sort through the strategic alternatives in an industry consolidation, helping to quantify and sensitize the potential scenarios. In addition, CFOs can provide constructive input concerning the types of transactions to be pursued, while reinforcing the need for discipline in crafting the terms.</p>
<p class="h2">Bolt-on Transactions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">“Bolt-ons” (also called “tuck-ins”) represent the most frequent type of acquisition, usually involving the full and relatively rapid integration of the acquired company within an existing business of the acquirer. Bolt-ons can be motivated by a desire to add the target's customer base, geographic reach, technologies, knowhow, product lines, brand names, or other valuable assets. In most cases, a bolt-on will produce attractive near-term financial returns for the acquirer—provided that a reasonable price is paid for the target.</p>
<p class="para">Although not typically as difficult to integrate as consolidation transactions, a series of bolt-ons can result in unexpected complexities and incremental costs, especially if they lead to a proliferation of disparate information technology systems, varying compensation and benefit programs, conflicting distribution channels, or ambiguous brand identities.</p>
<p class="para">The most successful acquirers in bolt-on transactions tend to employ <span class="italic">consistent and extremely disciplined processes</span> for integrating the acquired companies and they usually are manifestly ruthless in their identification and realization of cost synergies. For example, they normally impose standardized information technology systems and achieve immediate and total conformity among back office functions such as payroll; benefits; accounts payable; procurement; and email, voice mail, and other communication tools.</p>
<p class="para">Because bolt-ons tend to be motivated primarily by cost synergies, they usually can produce relatively rapid returns on investment—typically being accretive to earnings immediately or within a year or two, and earning a positive accounting return on investment within the near future. They also can be relatively low risk, especially if part of a series of similar transactions.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should be particularly sensitive to the prices paid for bolt-ons, ensuring that their projected returns are achievable and worth the effort involved in their execution and integration. They usually only make sense if the price is right.</p>
<p class="h2">Platform Transactions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">“Platforms” refer to transactions that allow the acquiring company to enter a new business or market, typically an adjacency to one of its existing businesses. As discussed earlier, this focus on adjacencies is usually critical to a platform's ultimate success, in contrast with diversifications into totally unrelated businesses, which are much more problematic.</p>
<p class="para">Often platforms are pursued where industries or technologies are converging, creating either a necessity or an opportunity to expand the acquired company's business or product lines. In this case, the acquirer typically makes the judgment that entering the new space through an acquisition is preferable to a purely organic alternative.</p>
<p class="para">For example, the acquirer may be seeking a new technology, an infrastructure, a management team, a customer base, or a brand identity. In the ideal case, a platform acquisition is encouraged by the acquirer's customers, or at least is readily accepted by the customers as a logical and desirable extension of the acquirer's existing product offerings and brand image.</p>
<p class="para">A platform transaction typically has fewer near-term cost synergies and therefore tends to have a longer financial payback than either a consolidation or a bolt-on transaction. It also can entail more risk exposure due to the acquirer's unfamiliarity with the business space or its greater reliance on the target's management team, who may not be committed to remaining after the non-compete agreements have expired. In particular, if the platform transaction involves a small, entrepreneurial business being acquired by a larger, more mature company, the acquirer should reasonably expect that not all of the management will thrive in their new environment and should plan on some turnover.</p>
<p class="para">A platform can involve a company that operates relatively independently from the acquirer's other businesses—perhaps with “<span class="italic">earnout</span>” incentives whereby the earnings are shared with the acquired company's management for a defined period. Also, a focus on rapid integration may be less of a priority for a platform than a bolt-on, so as not to impair the acquisition's culture or customer relationships. Usually the primary evaluation metric is revenue growth—at least over the near term—with the acquisition's return on investment not reaching fruition until its growth strategies have achieved their stated aims.</p>
<p class="para">A platform may involve an aggressive plan to consolidate a fragmented industry, usually involving several smaller transactions. This “<span class="italic">roll up</span>” strategy can generate attractive returns, but requires strong discipline in the prices paid for the transactions and rigorous conformity of systems and processes as these smaller entities come into the fold. It also requires the development of strong management processes; an experienced management team is usually a prerequisite to executing a roll up strategy successfully.</p>
<p class="h2">Transformative Transactions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Without question, transformations are the most controversial and the most difficult to pull off. The acquirer is attempting to shift its <span class="italic">center of gravity,</span> usually to lessen vulnerability to a stagnant or declining business. The existing business often is managed to generate cash flow—which is used to finance the acquisition and expand the new business—or is jettisoned through a divestiture or spinoff.</p>
<p class="para">Pursuing a transformative transaction is like asking the dealer for four cards in a hand of straight poker. It may work out, but it certainly would have been preferable to start with a pair of aces, let alone a full house. To succeed, it takes a highly qualified and courageous CEO, an attractive acquisition or merger opportunity, a reasonable price that is paid, and a lot of luck.</p>
<p class="para">It also requires a supportive shareholder base; investors understandably may be concerned about the potential risk and reward tradeoffs as the company embarks on this high risk alternative. While some transformations have succeeded—such as Westinghouse's conversion into CBS—the business landscape is littered with the carcasses of companies that have not survived the transition.</p>
<p class="para">If considering a transformation, CFOs will be challenged by investors to articulate a compelling rationale—especially a credible answer to the question: Why should the cash flows or divestiture proceeds from an existing business be reinvested in a new business rather than returned to shareholders? In addition, they will need to convince investors that management has the capabilities for executing this high wire strategy and realizing the financial advantages that are contemplated from the transaction.</p>
