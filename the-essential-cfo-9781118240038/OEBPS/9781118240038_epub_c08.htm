<p class="chaptertitle">Chapter Eight</p>
<p class="chaptertitle">Evaluating Acquisition Candidates</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">THE CFO SHOULD WORK CLOSELY with the business sponsor and the deal team in evaluating the candidates for a merger or acquisition. Even if an investment bank or other external financial advisor is engaged, the CFO remains directly responsible for determining the assumptions and projections that will establish the target's valuation. The CFO should ensure objective assessments of the target and apply consistent methodologies in the financial analyses.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c08-1">VALUATION METHODOLOGIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should use a combination of methodologies to determine an estimated valuation for the target. The valuation techniques usually include discounted cash flows, comparable companies, precedent transactions, and a leveraged buyout analysis. If the target is a public company, the valuation will also include a premiums paid analysis.</p>
<p class="h2">Discounted Cash Flows</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Discounted cash flow analyses are used to compute the net present value of the target, as well as internal rates of return using different assumed prices. CFOs prepare standalone projections for the target, and then overlay the projected net synergies, as well as the estimated costs of execution and integration.</p>
<p class="para">The standalone projections can be based on models prepared by security analysts or other third parties, on internal forecasts provided by the target company (perhaps with adjustments by the acquirer, usually to make them less optimistic), or on estimates prepared by the acquirer using assumptions developed through due diligence (the best alternative). The synergy projections are normally developed by the acquirer, although ideally the target's management will provide some input.</p>
<p class="h2">Comparable Companies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A comparable company analysis arrays valuation measures for the target against companies that are deemed similar. The comparison reflects current market valuations and includes performance measures and ratios that are typically used to value companies in that industry (such as multiples of net income, earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization [EBITDA], free cash flow, revenue, or book value). If an acquisition candidate is in diverse businesses, the valuation can be based on a weighted-average composite of values.</p>
<p class="para">In performing this analysis, CFOs should ensure that the current performance data are representative of normalized financial statements. If not, they can adjust the data to eliminate unusual items that may be distorting the comparisons or incorporate alternative time periods; in addition, they can focus on forward looking estimates, such as the forecast for next year's earnings per share.</p>
<p class="h2">Precedent Transactions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">An analysis of precedent transactions looks at the relevant multiples paid in arms-length acquisitions of companies that are similar to the target. These multiples are normally based on the trailing twelve months prior to the announcement of the transaction.</p>
<p class="para">In addition to analyzing the financial multiples—such as price paid relative to net income or EBITDA—CFOs can also consider non-financial measures such as the price paid per customer, the price paid per barrel of oil, or other performance measures that are relevant for the target's industry.</p>
<p class="h2">Leveraged Buyout</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Depending on the target's industry—and whether it generates relatively stable earnings and cash flow—a leveraged buyout (LBO) analysis can provide a further data point in valuing the target. An LBO analysis essentially considers the price range that likely could be realized through a private equity transaction.</p>
<p class="para">An LBO analysis normally establishes a floor valuation for the target, but there are also circumstances where a private equity transaction can exceed the price to be paid by a strategic acquirer. The key variables in this analysis are the amount and cost of debt financing that is currently available in the market (usually measured by the multiple of debt to EBITDA) and whether the target's industry is currently out of favor in the stock market (usually evidenced by a low valuation multiple to EBITDA).</p>
<p class="h2">Premiums Paid</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">If the target is a public company, the valuation should include an analysis of premiums paid over the market value in other public transactions. Because it is often unclear when the potential transaction began to affect the target's stock price, it is advisable to perform this analysis using alternative reference dates.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, if the acquirer is paying stock for part or all of the consideration, the CFO should analyze the historical exchange ratios between the two stocks—showing the market premium that is being paid based on average stock prices over both shorter and longer time periods.</p>
<p class="h2">Limitations of Methodologies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should be mindful of the inherent limitations in each of the methodologies. In particular, they should recognize that discounted cash flow valuations are extremely sensitive to the terminal values that are assumed—usually based on an assumed terminal multiple of free cash flow or EBITDA, or on an assumed perpetuity growth rate. For this reason, it can be useful for CFOs to calculate the amount of the target's valuation that is coming from discounted cash flows over a foreseeable time period (say, the next five years) versus the value that is derived from the longer-term assumptions, especially the terminal value.</p>
<p class="para">At the same time, CFOs should be aware that the comparable company and precedent transaction analyses reflect historical and near-term financial results, which may not be indicative of long-term trends. This can cause an acquirer to overpay for a target whose business is likely to decline, possibly due to an unproductive research and development program or a failure to invest in marketing and advertising.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c08-2">STANDALONE AND SYNERGY VALUES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should seek to distinguish between the target's standalone value versus the value created through the transaction. This is an important distinction that can highlight the dynamics of the proposed acquisition and provide a benchmark for negotiating the deal terms.</p>
<p class="h2">Market versus Intrinsic Value</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The standalone valuation uses projections for the target that exclude synergies and the costs of executing and integrating the acquisition. It is an estimate of the target's intrinsic value on a “<span class="italic">fully distributed</span>” basis—which assumes that the target's common stock is held by public shareholders who do not have a controlling interest and that its market value does not include an acquisition premium.</p>
<p class="para">If the target is a public company, the CFO should either validate or challenge the presumption that its current stock price is a fair representation of its intrinsic value. This recognizes that while the financial markets may be efficient on average over the long run, there definitely are times and  circumstances where a given stock may not be appropriately valued by the  market.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should be particularly vigilant in detecting a potential discrepancy between the target's intrinsic and market values when the possibility of a transaction may be baked into the stock price—often due to speculation that the target is in play. In other words, CFOs should make sure that the standalone valuation of the target does not include an acquisition premium—which would be tantamount to double counting the value that the acquirer is bringing to the party.</p>
<p class="h2">Value of Synergies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">After valuing the target on a standalone basis, CFOs should add the value of the net synergies to be derived from the combination, less the costs of executing and integrating the transaction. The value of the synergies can be estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis or by assuming a market multiple on the annualized contribution from the synergies.</p>
<p class="para">For example, if the annual synergies are estimated to be $40 million of incremental EBITDA and companies in the industry trade at a multiple of five times EBITDA, then the value of the synergies can be estimated at $200 million.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should then compare the value of the synergies with the estimated premium over standalone value that is being paid to the target's shareholders. For example, if the synergies are estimated to have a net present value of $200 million and the premium over the target's standalone value is estimated to be $100 million, the comparison indicates that half of the net value creation is being paid to the target's shareholders and half is being retained by the acquirer:</p>
<p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/c08eq1.jpg" alt="" width="364" height="91"/></p>
<p class="para">If the acquirer is paying common stock rather than cash to the target's shareholders, then additional value is transferred through their continuing ownership interest in the value of synergies retained by the acquirer. For example, if the target's shareholders receive 10 percent of the acquirer's shares outstanding, the calculations are revised as follows:</p>
<p class="equation"><img src="../OEBPS/images/c08eq2.jpg" alt="" width="452" height="150"/></p>
<p class="para">CFOs should be mindful of this ratio throughout the deal negotiations and remain vigilant against the all-too-frequent temptation to offer a price that compensates the target's shareholders for most, if not all, of the value of synergies. Otherwise, even though the transaction creates value, it can be a losing proposition for the acquirer's shareholders.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c08-3">PRO FORMA ANALYSES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In addition to the valuation analyses, CFOs also will prepare pro forma analyses of the potential acquisition, taking into account not only the standalone projections for the target, but also the estimated net synergies and transaction costs.</p>
<p class="h2">Earnings per Share</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The most common pro forma analysis is to compute the incremental impact on earnings per share due to the acquisition. This analysis can assume either the financing actually being used for the transaction or, alternatively, it can assume a financing mix that reflects the acquirer's assumptions for its long-run capital structure.</p>
<p class="para">For example, the acquirer may be financing the transaction with debt that has an after-tax cost of 5 percent, while its weighted-average cost of capital is estimated to be 10 percent. In this case, if the acquisition will earn an after-tax return on investment of 8 percent, it will be accretive when using the cost of debt, but dilutive when using the weighted-average cost of capital. The latter is a better theoretical exercise, but using the actual financing shows the financial impact that the stock market will see.</p>
<p class="para">Probably the best solution is to show the pro forma impact both ways. This allows the CFO to make apples-to-apples comparisons among transactions, but also to show the actual impact due to the specific terms of the transaction. This favors paying cash rather than stock—which doesn't make sense from a corporate finance perspective—but reflects the way that the market reacts to transactions.</p>
<p class="para">When analyzing the accretion or dilution, CFOs should focus on two key points. First, they should consider the year-over-year trends; dilution is more tolerable if it is forecast to improve each year and to become accretive in the near future. Second, they should consider the magnitude of the accretion or dilution; a percentage change of greater than 5 percent is a good rule for when the accretion or dilution can be viewed as material.</p>
<p class="h2">Return on Investment</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The pro forma accounting return on investment can be computed using the acquirer's cost of capital, showing the economic value added (EVA) from the transaction. However, CFOs should recognize that it usually is very difficult for an acquisition to produce positive EVA during the first few years if a premium is paid over the target's book value. The premium causes an increase in the target's invested capital and the write-up of intangibles causes a decrease in the target's earnings due to the amortization charges. Therefore, CFOs may want to exclude the amortization of intangibles in their pro forma EVA analysis.</p>
<p class="para">Moreover, in comparison to a discounted cash flow analysis, an accounting-based EVA analysis does not give as much value to the projected growth in future earnings. If a high growth company is being acquired, it likely will be several years before a conventional EVA analysis will show a positive return on investment. This may create a bias toward acquisition targets that have lower growth rates and quicker realization of synergies.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, if an acquisition is projected never to earn a positive EVA over a foreseeable time horizon, that should be a red flag for CFOs in analyzing the likelihood that the transaction can add shareholder value. In particular, it means that the acquirer is betting on substantial future growth, which should be scrutinized carefully for its reasonableness.</p>
<p class="h2">Return on Equity</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another common analysis is to consider the impact on the company's return on equity (net income as a percent of book equity). Normally, this analysis is computed using the actual financing for the transaction—which means that there is no capital charge for an all-cash transaction. It can be a useful analysis if the acquirer will be paying with excess cash or unused debt capacity and will not need to raise additional equity in the future, thus indicating the incremental accounting return on shareholders' invested capital.</p>
<p class="h2">Other Pro Forma Analyses</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Depending on the type of acquisition, additional pro forma measures may be especially pertinent. For example, if acquiring a high-growth business, the CFO should analyze the pro forma impact on the acquirer's revenue growth rate. In contrast, if acquiring a low growth business, the contribution to the acquirer's EBITDA or free cash flow may be more relevant.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs should perform pro forma analyses that relate to the strategic objectives for the transaction. For example, they might focus on non-financial measurements, such as the impact on customers or market shares, or show how the transaction will affect the company's business profile, such as the percentage of its revenue in emerging markets.</p>
<p class="h2">Stock Price Impact</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The pro forma analyses are especially important in cases where the acquirer is issuing stock to the target: They can indicate the potential near-term impact on the acquirer's stock price, which can affect the value of the consideration to be received by the target company's shareholders (as well as the purchase accounting adjustments).</p>
<p class="h1" id="c08-4">ACQUIRER'S STOCK VALUATION</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">If the acquirer is issuing stock as part of the consideration, the CFO will want to assess whether its stock price prior to the announcement reflects its intrinsic value. If the stock is judged to be overvalued, this will effectively reduce the consideration paid to the target; if the stock is considered to be undervalued, this will effectively raise the premium being paid, perhaps making the transaction not economically viable.</p>
<p class="para">For example, if the CFO believes that the acquirer's stock price is undervalued by 10 percent, this raises the implicit premium by 10 percent in an all-stock transaction and by 5 percent if half the consideration is being paid in stock.</p>
<p class="para">However, CFOs should recognize that while targets will perform due diligence on the acquirer's stock price, they are highly unlikely to accept a lower premium as a result of their analysis. Instead, they tend to fear an overvalued stock—which can be a good reason not to proceed with the deal—and to consider an undervalued stock as potential upside, but not a reason to accept a lower price.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c08-5">RISK CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In evaluating potential transactions, CFOs should explicitly address their implications for enterprise risks—analyzing both positive and negative effects. They should analyze the financial implications under different scenarios and consider the strategic implications in light of the company's business objectives.</p>
<p class="h2">Financial Implications</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Acquisition analyses typically focus on one or a very limited number of scenarios. A few CFOs have tried to employ Monte Carlo analyses and other sophisticated methodologies, but their greater complexity tends to overwhelm the benefits: It is hard to maintain transparency when the assumptions are varied, to distinguish the relative effects caused by each of the variables, and to apply the standard valuation techniques that are largely based on accumulated experience and heuristics.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, CFOs should consider alternative scenarios in their acquisition analyses, especially when analyzing major transactions. In particular, they should include a downside scenario where several things are assumed to go wrong at the same time. This recognizes that a number of key variables may be correlated and that no matter how well an acquisition is executed, its value can be eroded due to factors outside of the acquirer's control.</p>
<p class="para">At the same time, sensitivity analyses can also reveal positive effects on the acquirer; for example, the company may become less vulnerable to economic or political uncertainties as a result of the combination, or the company may be less reliant on major customers or products. In other words, although diversification should not be the primary motivation for the transaction, it can be one of the benefits that is realized.</p>
<p class="h2">Strategic Implications</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should also consider the acquisition's risks from a strategic perspective. For example, the potential benefits from a transaction simply may not be worth the increased risk exposure due to excessive strain on the company's technology infrastructure or the likelihood of too much channel conflict. However, in making this assessment, CFOs should be careful to distinguish between those risks that can be resolved by investors' diversification versus those risks that investors would not want the company to retain.</p>
<p class="para">Conversely, the benefits to the company's risk position—for example, due to the greater diversification of technologies, customer demographics, or brand names—may make the transaction more compelling, perhaps overcoming a relatively modest return on investment. In other words, reducing risk can be one of the strategic motivations to proceed with a transaction in the first place, assuming that the financials can be made to work satisfactorily.</p>
