<p class="chaptertitle">Establishing Capital Structure Objectives</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">THE CFO'S SKILL IN MANAGING the capital structure can have a material impact on a company's cost of capital and can make the difference between financing strategies that are appropriate for a company versus those that cross the line of prudence. As became abundantly evident in the recent financial crisis, the effectiveness of the CFO's management of the capital structure literally can determine a company's life or death as a going concern—obviously a responsibility that should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p class="para">The capital structure is also fundamental to accomplishing the company's strategic and financial objectives: The financing decisions must be in sync with the investment decisions.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c12-1">LEVERAGE TARGETS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">One of the most important decisions is the establishment of debt leverage targets, which provide the underpinnings for the company's financing strategies. CFOs usually express their debt leverage targets in three different ways: a cost of capital assumption, company-specific leverage ratios, and a debt ratings objective.</p>
<p class="h2">Cost of Capital Assumption</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The most fundamental of the leverage targets is the ratio between the market value of a company's equity securities and its total market capitalization. This is the ratio that is used in the capital asset pricing model to determine the company's weighted average cost of capital; it represents the target capital structure for financing the company over the planning horizon (say, the next five to 10 years).</p>
<p class="para">For example, the CFO may assume that the target ratio is 30 percent debt and 70 percent equity. This implies that if the company needs additional financing, the incremental funding will be raised in that proportion of debt and equity. Likewise, if the company generates surplus cash, it implies that 70 percent will be returned to shareholders and 30 percent will be used to pay down debt.</p>
<p class="para">This is a theoretical assumption; the company's actual capital structure at any point in time may differ considerably from this assumed financing mix, especially during periods of volatile stock prices or interest rates. Nevertheless, it is the purest definition of the target that the CFO intends to use in meeting the company's funding requirements.</p>
<p class="h2">Company-Specific Ratios</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs also express their objectives in terms of leverage ratios that are used by analysts in their industry or that are contained in their debt covenants. For example, they might communicate their debt leverage targets using one or more of the following ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="italic">Debt to book capitalization,</span> which is equal to net debt (total debt less cash) as a percent of net debt plus book equity.</li><li><span class="italic">Debt to EBITDA,</span> which is equal to total debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).</li><li><span class="italic">Debt to cash flow,</span> which is equal to total debt divided by cash flow from operations.</li><li><span class="italic">Interest coverage,</span> which is equal to EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) divided by interest expense.</li><li><span class="italic">Fixed charge coverage,</span> which is equal to EBIT divided by interest expense, preferred dividends, and an interest component for operating leases.</li></ul>

<p class="para">Highly leveraged companies tend to use debt to EBITDA as their primary ratio, while less leveraged companies tend to use debt to book capitalization.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, companies in regulated industries—such as banks—will express their leverage targets as defined by their regulatory requirements (e.g., Tier 1 capital as a percent of assets).</p>
<p class="h2">Debt Ratings Objective</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Most important, CFOs will also express their leverage targets in terms of their desired debt ratings from the rating agencies. This is normally the way that CFOs communicate their capital structure objectives to both debt and equity investors; the ratings objective is easily understood and preserves some leeway with respect to the company's targets for its cost of capital and company-specific leverage ratios.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c12-2">LEVERAGE CRITERIA</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">While the establishment of leverage targets can seem deceptively simple, the manner of their development is actually quite complex, involving a number of factors that can influence the targeted mix between equity and debt in a company's capital structure.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, the primary motivation to use debt is the lower cost of capital. However, this motivation can be countered by other considerations, including the company's strategic plan objectives, its size and maturity, its business profile, its risk tolerance, and its need for financial flexibility. The leverage targets can also be influenced by long-term conditions and trends in the financial markets.</p>
<p class="h2">Strategic Plan</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The leverage targets normally are highly dependent on the company's business and financial objectives. CFOs should establish targets that provide the financial wherewithal to accomplish the company's strategies, which may imply greater or lesser use of debt.</p>
<p class="para">They should also evaluate the company's need for financial flexibility. Higher debt leverage usually comes with strings attached—especially restrictive covenants—that may be incompatible with accomplishing the company's strategic objectives.</p>
<p class="para">In particular, CFOs should analyze their strategic plan's financial projections—especially the forecasted cash flow from operations in comparison to the company's requirements for capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions—as well as the potential volatility in the projections. The leverage targets should be appropriate not only for the base case projections, but also using alternative assumptions, including a downside scenario.</p>
<p class="h2">Size and Maturity</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The CFO's range of alternatives in setting the leverage targets will be largely influenced by the company's size and maturity. Larger, well-established companies generally will have more access to capital and less risk of insolvency than smaller, start-up companies. Simply put, a large capitalization company has more flexibility in its funding sources—even if it is not too big to fail—and therefore it has greater ability to handle debt.</p>
<p class="para">Smaller, less-established companies tend to have less flexibility to use debt and often must fund their expansion with a higher percentage of equity. Therefore, they usually will employ less debt leverage in their target capital structure.</p>
<p class="h2">Business Profile</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The ability to employ debt will also be affected by the company's business profile. A company in an asset intensive industry—such as natural resources or real estate—will be more likely to use debt, especially if the assets can serve as collateral for creditors. Companies with greater diversity in their earnings and cash flow streams also can employ more leverage.</p>
<p class="para">In contrast, companies in industries with low asset intensity—such as high technology or professional services—typically have less ability to use debt. This is particularly true for companies that are highly dependent on a product or service that can be threatened by competitors.</p>
<p class="para">The ability to employ debt leverage will also be influenced by the company's operational leverage. In general, CFOs should be more cautious in using debt when earnings and cash flow are volatile.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, maintaining a strong credit rating may be important to a company's customer relationships. For example, companies that hold customer cash in a fiduciary capacity must be focused on the strength of their balance sheet.</p>
<p class="h2">Risk Tolerance</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The leverage target will also reflect the relative appetite and tolerance for financial risk among the company's board of directors, shareholders, and customers, often reflecting the prevailing norms in the company's industry and product lines. CFOs should also be mindful of the capital structures used by competitors, which may indicate that assuming more or less financial risk is necessary to stay competitive.</p>
<p class="para">Moreover, if a company has a history of conservative financial management, it may be problematic to shift too greatly or too quickly—especially if the new policy has not been signaled to investors well in advance of the change.</p>
<p class="para">In contrast, a company may be very comfortable with risk. This is particularly true when companies are owned by private equity investors, who can diversify their risks among a portfolio of investments. They may prefer to employ more debt to lower the cost of capital, accelerate expansion, and capture more of the potential upside.</p>
<p class="h2">Market Conditions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Finally, the leverage decision may be influenced by conditions in the financial markets. For example, a company will be less likely to employ debt leverage during market environments where its access to liquidity and long-term debt capital is severely constrained. In general, higher debt levels will be more desirable and feasible in favorable markets than during periods when investors are more risk averse.</p>
<p class="para">However, the leverage target should reflect long-term strategies and CFOs should be careful to distinguish between prolonged and transitory market trends.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c12-3">RATING AGENCIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Historically, the two most important rating agencies have been <span class="italic">Standard &amp; Poor's,</span> which is part of McGraw-Hill, and <span class="italic">Moody's Investors Service,</span> which is an NYSE-listed public company (after a spinoff from Dun &amp; Bradstreet in 2000). A third major agency that has gained greater prominence and influence in recent years is <span class="italic">Fitch Ratings,</span> which is owned by Fimalac, a French company.</p>
<p class="para">Three lesser-known agencies are <span class="italic">DBRS</span> (Dominion Bond Ratings Service), which was formed in 1976 and is based in Toronto, <span class="italic">Egan-Jones Ratings,</span> a private firm that was founded in Philadelphia in 1994, and <span class="italic">Rapid Ratings,</span> which was founded in New Zealand in 1991 and brought to the United States in 2007. An additional agency, <span class="italic">Kroll Bond Ratings,</span> began operations in New York in 2010 with the stated intention of “building a service that restores trust in credit ratings.” Each of these newer agencies features a business model that focuses primarily on the users of the information rather than on the issuers.</p>
<p class="para">While it is true that the major rating agencies have lost much of their credibility due to their failure to anticipate the recent financial crisis, they still have considerable clout in the securities markets, largely due to governments, institutions, and companies that use their ratings to define permissible investments in corporate, sovereign, and municipal fixed income securities. They can also sway fixed income investment decisions by individual investors. Moreover, the publicity generated from their changes in ratings can influence the stock prices of the affected companies.</p>
<p class="para">A frequent criticism of the major rating agencies is that their fees are paid by the issuers. To investors, this can represent a conflict of interest, especially when issuers can shop among the agencies to obtain an acceptable rating for their proposed debt issuance. To CFOs, this payment structure can give the agencies too much leverage in raising their fees, usually giving companies little alternative but to pay the higher rate.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c12-4">RATINGS CATEGORIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Although the agencies have slight differences in the definitions of their ratings categories, they are sufficiently similar to facilitate a shorthand communication of a company's ratings target. Generally they can be expressed as triple-A (very rare!), double-A, single-A, triple-B, double-B, single-B, and three levels of C-rated debt. Moody's uses slightly different letter combinations (such as Baa instead of BBB) but the categories are substantively the same. Ratings of triple-B and above are “investment grade,” while ratings of double-B and below are “speculative.”</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>
</div>

<p class="featuretitle">Debt Rating Categories</p>
<table class="bodytable" border="1">
<tbody><tr><td class="headercell">Moody's</td><td class="headercell">Standard &amp; Poor's</td><td class="headercell">Fitch</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Aaa</td><td class="bodycell">AAA</td><td class="bodycell">AAA</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Aa</td><td class="bodycell">AA</td><td class="bodycell">AA</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">A</td><td class="bodycell">A</td><td class="bodycell">A</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Baa</td><td class="bodycell">BBB</td><td class="bodycell">BBB</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Speculative:</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Ba</td><td class="bodycell">BB</td><td class="bodycell">BB</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">B</td><td class="bodycell">B</td><td class="bodycell">B</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Caa</td><td class="bodycell">CCC</td><td class="bodycell">CCC</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Ca</td><td class="bodycell">CC</td><td class="bodycell">CC</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">C</td><td class="bodycell">C</td><td class="bodycell">C</td></tr></tbody></table>
<div class="hr"><hr/>
</div>

</div>

<p class="para">Each rating category can also include the addition of a plus and minus (or numerals 1 through 3 for Moody's), which affects how many “notches” the ratings are changed. For example, declining from A+ to BBB+ (or from A1 to Baa1) is a three-notch move. The agencies will also communicate their “outlooks,” which indicate whether the rating is more likely to improve, remain stable, or decline.</p>
<p class="h2">Investment-Grade Alternatives</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For most large companies, higher debt ratings are generally more prestigious, which can have a positive impact among customers, suppliers, and employees. For example, ADP is one of the few triple-A companies, undoubtedly giving its customers comfort in outsourcing their payroll services, including the float that is entrusted to ADP in a fiduciary capacity.</p>
<p class="para">However, a company's weighted average cost of capital tends to become lower as it goes down the ratings scale—until it reaches the demarcation between investment grade and speculative debt, where a company's cost and access to capital can be materially affected, especially in difficult financial conditions. Consequently, CFOs of public companies will usually advocate target debt ratings that are mid to lower investment grade—typically in the single-A or triple-B ratings categories.</p>
<p class="h2">Investment Grade versus Speculative</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The significant difference between investment grade and speculative ratings can be seen clearly in the agencies' definitions. For example, Moody's definitions are:<a id="c12-not-0001-1" href="#c12-not-0001"><span class="superscript">1</span></a></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Baa:</span> “Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are considered medium grade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.”</li><li><span class="bold">Ba:</span> “Obligations rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk.”</li></ul>

<p class="para">Being classified in the speculative categories generally means:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">More Risk:</span> The agencies believe that there is a meaningful risk of a credit default.</li><li><span class="bold">Fewer Investors:</span> Many potential investors will be prohibited from purchasing the debt.</li><li><span class="bold">Less Market Access:</span> The company's access to the debt markets will be restricted at times.</li><li><span class="bold">Less Flexibility:</span> The company's flexibility will be constrained by restrictive debt covenants.</li><li><span class="bold">High Yield:</span> The company's public debt securities will be issued in the high-yield market and referred to pejoratively as “junk.”</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Rationale for Speculative Ratings</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given the negative consequences from a non-investment grade rating, most CFOs strive to achieve and maintain investment grade ratings. So why would a CFO ever advocate a speculative ratings target?</p>
<p class="para">First, in the case of smaller, less-established companies, the cost of attaining an investment grade rating may not be worth it. Indeed, because size and diversification are extremely important attributes in bond ratings, it may be virtually impossible for certain companies to achieve an investment-grade debt rating—even if they have little or no debt. Therefore, if a company needs capital to fulfill its strategic objectives, the high yield market may be its best alternative.</p>
<p class="para">Second, equity investors (especially private equity firms) often prefer the additional upside from the greater debt leverage that may only be possible at the lower ratings categories. They may be especially comfortable with the risk/reward tradeoff when their equity investments are diversified in a larger portfolio and if they also take a position in the debt securities—which may allow them to maintain control of the company in the event of financial duress. Also, private equity investors usually have considerable expertise concerning the leveraged finance market, allowing them to add value through capital structure actions in response to changing market conditions.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c12-5">RATING AGENCY DIALOGUES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The CFO will typically maintain regular communications with the rating agencies, updating them concerning any material strategic, business, or financial developments. Provided that they comply with their commitment to maintain confidentiality, the agencies can be treated as “insiders” who can receive non-public information without violating the Fair Disclosure rule or the securities laws.</p>
<p class="para">The ability to share insider information can be especially valuable to CFOs, allowing them to discuss the potential ratings impact from strategic and financial actions that are being contemplated. This can prevent surprises from the agencies, which otherwise can be mercurial in their reactions to material events.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs typically will meet with each of the agencies annually for a full review of their company's business and financial strategies and to share their current financial projections. These meetings normally include a written presentation, which usually is also provided to the audit committee and perhaps to the full board of directors.</p>
<p class="para">The CFO's meetings with the rating agencies generally produce constructive dialogues, especially if the agency maintains continuity in the team that covers the company. However, the agencies generally will be noncommittal concerning future upgrades or downgrades, which are subject to review by their internal committees.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, their ratings actions almost always lag the company's financial performance—on both the downside and the upside—meaning that they usually do not take any actions until the change in a company's status is already reflected in the pricing of its securities in the debt market.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c12-6">RATINGS CRITERIA</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs will also regularly monitor the ratios and metrics that are used by each of the agencies and the credit markets. These credit statistics include debt leverage ratios—such as debt to market and book capitalization, debt to EBITDA and cash flow, and coverage of interest and fixed charges—as well as profitability measures such as operating margins and returns on invested capital.</p>
<p class="para">In reviewing a company's credit statistics, the agencies will consider the stability and trends in the financial ratios, as well as their absolute numbers. Moreover, they will give greater leeway to the credit ratios of larger, more established, and diversified companies, as well as companies with high-quality, stable management. As a result, two companies with the same credit ratios may very well have differing debt ratings, usually reflecting the greater deference that the agencies will give to larger companies.</p>
<p class="para">Although there are more similarities than differences in the rating agencies' approach to their ratings, each of the agencies has distinctive criteria and methodologies. For example, the agencies may differ in their treatment of leases and other off balance sheet rental obligations and in their adjustments for unfunded pension obligations.</p>
<p class="para">Given these differences, CFOs should review their credit statistics with each of the agencies to ascertain how they are calculated. In addition, they should monitor their credit statistics using the agencies' alternative definitions. The agencies are generally willing to discuss the specifics of their ratings criteria and often will provide guidance concerning the improvements necessary to achieve a higher rating. They will also indicate areas of potential concern that could lead to a downgrade.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, while the various credit statistics can be useful indicators in predicting a company's likely debt ratings, CFOs should recognize that they may not be determinative. As noted above, the ratings are heavily influenced by a company's relative size (typically measured by its revenue and assets) and the consistency of its earnings and cash flow, as well as subjective judgments concerning the stability and quality of its management and the rigor of its risk management procedures. In addition, the agencies often have views of industries and businesses that can color their approach to a company's ratings—perhaps reflecting a judgment that the company is a good house in a bad neighborhood.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c12-7">INFORMING INVESTORS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Investors usually have a keen interest in a company's rating objectives. At a minimum, most equity as well as debt investors will want to know whether a company intends to maintain or increase its current debt ratings and will seek to learn the circumstances where the company would consider a potential downgrade in its ratings—especially if it would consider a strategic action, such as an acquisition, that would likely take the company from an investment grade to a speculative rating.</p>
<p class="para">Investors will also want to know if the company's debt rating objectives may constrain its capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, or acquisition strategies. Consequently, CFOs should indicate to investors whether a company's debt rating targets are fixed absolutes that may impact its strategic objectives or whether they are malleable targets that are conditional on the facts and circumstances, including potential acquisition or investment opportunities.</p>
<p class="para">Although CFOs should seek to establish leverage targets that can be expected to last for an indefinite period, they should remain flexible in considering revisions in response to changes in external or company-specific conditions. For this reason, it usually is advisable to express the targets as ranges, providing more room to maneuver and less need for frequent revisions.</p>
