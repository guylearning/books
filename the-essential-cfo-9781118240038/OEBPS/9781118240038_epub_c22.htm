<p class="chaptertitle">Reinforcing Compliance and Controls</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CONSISTENT WITH THEIR ROLE IN RISK MANAGEMENT, CFOs are charged with the responsibility to encourage and perpetuate a focus on compliance and controls. This has always been a priority for CFOs, but undoubtedly this focus has become much more important since the adoption of Sarbanes-Oxley and the greater emphasis on enterprise risk management.</p>
<p class="para">Boards of directors are acutely sensitive to regulatory trends in jurisdictions throughout the world and recognize that any lapses in compliance and controls can cause significant damage to a company's reputation and financial well-being.</p>
<p class="para">U.S. companies are especially mindful of the “Federal Sentencing Guidelines” that apply to both public and private companies, including non-profits and specify that an organization shall:</p><div class="list"><div class="item1">1. Exercise due diligence to prevent and detect criminal conduct; and
</div>
<div class="item1">2. Otherwise promote an organizational culture that encourages ethical conduct and a commitment to compliance with the law.<a id="c22-not-0001-1" href="#c22-not-0001"><span class="superscript">1</span></a>

<p class="h1" id="c22-1">CONTROL ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can play a major role in creating and reinforcing healthy control environments that meet the heightened expectations of today's regulatory climate. Along with the CEO and management team, they can influence the company's adherence to high standards by setting a positive “tone at the top,” promulgating a “code of conduct,” and establishing a “zero tolerance” attitude.</p>
<p class="h2">Tone at the Top</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The CFO's role begins with setting a “tone at the top” where his or her resolute commitment to high ethical standards is unquestioned throughout the financial organization. Indeed, <span class="italic">integrity</span> is usually cited as an essential quality for the modern CFO.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs will also enlist the support of their CEOs and business leaders to reinforce the tone at the top. An annual email from the CEO can be a powerful reminder, raising compliance and good business practices to a top-of-mind priority.</p>
<p class="para">They should also include control-related topics as part of the standard agenda for business reviews. For example, reviewing a status report on outstanding audit issues is an excellent vehicle for highlighting the importance of controls, which otherwise might be perceived as a mundane issue. They also can highlight potential regulatory developments in their strategic and risk management reviews.</p>
<p class="h2">Code of Conduct</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A “code of conduct” can be another valuable tool for inculcating the right culture throughout the company. With dispersed locations and several business lines, companies often view their code of conduct as a way to reinforce a “one-company” attitude—where everyone applies high standards and exhibits mutual trust—among colleagues, customers, business partners, and communities. It complements the company's “values statement” by extolling the principles that should guide behavior.</p>
<p class="para">As a best practice, companies are converting their codes of conduct from the traditional legalese into common sense <span class="italic">plain talk</span> that is easily understood. They are also promoting their codes of conduct through several means, including posting them on the web, sending out targeted emails, providing a hard copy version to every employee, translating them into several languages, and creating  a video. Furthermore, they are sponsoring training programs and requiring annual online certifications that employees have agreed to abide by the code.</p>
<p class="h2">Zero Tolerance</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given their mandate to reinforce a culture of compliance and controls, CFOs typically seek to instill a zero tolerance attitude toward any ethical lapses and to establish processes for achieving compliance with applicable legal requirements throughout the world. Similar to the “<span class="italic">broken window</span>” theory of police work, CFOs usually encourage a focus on even minor violations of a company's code of conduct, thereby reinforcing a culture of adherence to good business practices. Just as a focus on broken windows can improve the crime environment, so can attention to small matters enhance the control environment.</p>
<p class="para">For example, travel and entertainment (T&amp;E) policies can be a good vehicle for instituting a zero tolerance attitude. Although they generally are minor infractions, T&amp;E issues can represent a large percentage of audit findings and can be an indicator of potentially serious issues such as fraud or a possible violation of anti-corruption laws. Therefore, CFOs can get good visibility by setting a goal to reduce their frequency.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, many CFOs have realized benefits from the implementation of an Internet-based T&amp;E system; it can facilitate procurement savings, in addition to fostering a strong control environment. In some cases, CFOs have further reinforced the need for compliance by outsourcing reviews of T&amp;E submissions to a low-cost site like India—thus reinforcing their focus on small as well as large infractions.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c22-2">AUDITOR AND BOARD SUPPORT</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In fulfilling their compliance and control objectives, CFOs should work in tandem with legal and compliance professionals throughout the company. In addition, they should leverage the support of internal auditors, external auditors, and the board of directors—especially the audit committee—in monitoring potential issues and ensuring that compliance and controls remain front-and-center priorities.</p>
<p class="h2">Internal Auditors</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Internal auditors can play a vital role in achieving the CFO's compliance and control objectives. Like the cavalry in nineteenth-century warfare, the internal auditors can serve as the company's eyes and ears in detecting potential issues throughout the world. Furthermore, their comprehensive audit findings can identify conditions that may violate a company's policies or otherwise pose risks to the company's reputation.</p>
<p class="para">Internal auditors can also bring specialized expertise to the assessment of risk. For example, they have been emphasizing skills in information technology and fraud detection. Also, by tapping into outsourcing services, they can bring in specialized talent to complement their internal skill sets.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, by keeping good records concerning their audit findings across business units and geographic locations, the internal auditors can identify pockets for improvement that deserve special focus by the CFO and the audit committee. For example, they may perceive patterns—such as information technology issues—that are growing in importance; the internal auditors can recommend actions to address the issues before they migrate to other areas of the company, often suggesting best practices that have been applied elsewhere.</p>
<p class="h2">External Auditors</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">External auditors are another valuable source of input. They can highlight potential issues, bringing to bear their experience with other companies in similar situations. For this reason, audit committees especially value their chance to have candid discussions with the external auditors in executive sessions, often learning of potential issues that could fester if not properly addressed.</p>
<p class="para">The external auditors can also inform the CFO of situations where the financial staff is being stretched or where their skill sets may not be equal to the tasks to be performed. Their candid, off-the-record feedback can be a godsend to CFOs, who may be oblivious to the strained conditions in the field.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, the external auditors can play an instrumental role in developing internal audit's annual plan, helping to identify the areas that deserve particular attention. Because the audit staff is stretched in most companies, prioritization is crucial in dedicating the right resources to the right places. Given their broad-based experience, the external auditors can be a font of helpful input to the allocation of limited resources.</p>
<p class="h2">Board of Directors</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The board of directors can be an effective ally for CFOs in establishing the desired culture. Through their interactions with the business leaders and through the prioritization of their agendas for audit and risk committees, the board members can elevate the importance of compliance and control issues within the company's overall hierarchy of priorities. For example, by regularly  receiving summaries of all significant audit findings, they can signal their expectation that the issues will be addressed promptly and fully. The board can also request in-depth reviews of ethical or regulatory issues—especially if they involve violations of law—and determine if any changes should be made in the company's procedures, policies, or personnel.</p>
<p class="para">The audit committee, in particular, can be an indispensable source of support. For example, by regularly including compliance as a topic in their agendas, audit committees can highlight the company's commitment to high standards and exemplary conduct. Like a Congressional hearing, an audit committee review of a topic sends a signal that this should be an important priority for business and financial leaders; furthermore, the preparation for this review can be a healthy exercise for the people involved.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, if the CFO regularly provides updates to the audit committee, these reports can serve as a mechanism for ensuring appropriate follow-up on control issues. For example, by providing a scorecard showing open audit issues, the CFO is conveying a tacit reminder that these issues need to be addressed in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="para">If the board has compliance or risk committees, they likewise can be excellent forums for accentuating the CFO's compliance and control priorities.</p>
<p class="para">Board members are also increasingly interfacing directly with governmental agencies. This is especially true with respect to financial services companies, but it's likely to become a growing trend in most other industries as well. As a result, CFOs and management teams should make sure to keep the board fully informed concerning any regulatory developments or emerging issues.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c22-3">FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In cultivating their control environment, CFOs should pay special attention to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), which imposes strict anti-bribery standards with respect to the international activities of all U.S. companies—both private and public—as well as non-U.S. companies that file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p class="para">FCPA can present challenges as companies expand into countries that have differing norms concerning the way that business is conducted. In response, companies must ensure that their desire to adapt to local customs does not cross the line of violating this U.S law. The fines and penalties can be steep and the cumulative impact on a company's reputation can be severe. Consequently, the standard of compliance should be “<span class="italic">non-negotiable</span>”—absolute conformity with the law.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should familiarize themselves with the application of FCPA to various situations that can arise. For example, representatives of state-owned enterprises are treated as government officials under the law. They also should ensure that effective controls are in place in the hiring of third parties, including adequate due diligence and well-defined limits of authority.</p>
<p class="para">In addition to focusing on potential FCPA issues, CFOs should be cognizant of the rules emanating from non-U.S. regulators. For example, the U.K. Bribery Act criminalizes commercial bribery as well as bribery of foreign government officials. Indeed, CFOs are likely to be increasingly challenged to stay abreast of new regulations and guidelines that are promulgated by jurisdictions throughout the world.</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>

<p class="featuretitle">COSO Report on Corporate Fraud</p>
<p class="featurepara">In 2010, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission's report on corporate fraud concluded that financial fraud continues to be a significant issue. Based on 350 alleged accounting fraud cases investigated by the SEC during 1999–2007, the report included the following conclusions:<span class="superscript">a</span></p>
<ul>
<li>“Financial fraud affects companies of all sizes, with the median company having assets and revenues just under $100 million.”</li><li>“The median fraud was $12.1 million. More than 30 of the fraud cases each involved misstatements/misappropriations of $500 million or more.”</li><li>“The SEC named the CEO and/or CFO for involvement in 89 percent of the fraud cases. Within two years of the completion of the SEC investigation, about 20 percent of CEOs/CFOs had been indicted. Over 60 percent of those indicted were convicted.”</li><li>“Revenue frauds accounted for over 60 percent of the cases.”</li><li>“Many of the commonly observed board of director and audit committee characteristics such as size, meeting frequency, composition, and experience, do not differ meaningfully between fraud and no-fraud companies. Recent corporate governance regulatory efforts appear to have reduced variation in observable board-related governance characteristics.”</li><li>“Twenty-six percent of the firms engaged in fraud changed auditors during the period examined compared to a 12 percent rate for no-fraud firms.”</li><li>“Initial news in the press of an alleged fraud resulted in an average 16.7 percent abnormal stock price decline for the fraud company in the two days surrounding the announcement.”</li><li>“News of an SEC or Department of Justice investigation resulted in an average 7.3 percent abnormal stock price decline.”</li><li>“Companies engaged in fraud often experienced bankruptcy, delisting from a stock exchange, or material asset sales at rates much higher than those experienced by no-fraud firms.”</li></ul>
<div class="featurefootnote"><span class="superscript">a</span>“Financial fraud at U.S. public companies often results in bankruptcy or failure, with significant immediate losses for shareholders and penalties for executives” (May 20, 2010, COSO News Release, <span class="inlineurl"><a href="http://www.coso.org">www.coso.org</a></span>).

<p class="h1" id="c22-4">FRAUD PREVENTION</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs are well aware of the truism that despite their best efforts to instill a culture of compliance—and notwithstanding the good intentions of Sarbanes-Oxley and other procedures—fraud will continue to be a risk to the organization. Therefore, they need to be ever-vigilant in detecting and eliminating fraudulent activities that may arise.</p>
<p class="para">Given the prevalence and consequences of financial fraud, internal audit teams have been enhancing their expertise in fraud detection and CFOs, as well as audit committees, have been escalating their focus on fraud prevention. This includes support for whistleblower procedures within the company and sponsoring additional training in <span class="italic">forensic accounting</span> and other fraud detection skills. Unfortunately, fraud is likely to be a continuing, if not growing, issue for most companies, requiring continuous attention.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, the continued presence of financial fraud provides further evidence that companies need to ensure that their management practices and compensation programs do not provide undue incentives to attain financial targets. Moreover, it highlights the singular importance of hiring finance professionals who are paragons of probity.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c22-5">WHISTLEBLOWERS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The implementation of the new Dodd-Frank Act rules undoubtedly will have profound effects on financial services companies, compelling them to comply with various restrictions concerning the amount of capital required and the types of business transactions that can be conducted. And the “say on pay” provisions clearly will be significantly influencing the way that public companies manage their compensation programs.</p>
<p class="para">However, the provision in Dodd-Frank that is likely to have the most far-reaching impact is the “whistleblower” provision that became effective in August 2011. This provision provides that mandatory awards of 10 to 30 percent of the amount recovered will be paid to a whistleblower who voluntarily provides “original information” from “independent knowledge” of a violation that is successfully enforced by either the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for a penalty of at least $1 million. The whistleblower does not need to be an employee of the company involved.</p>
<p class="para">The implementation of this provision is a source of consternation within many companies—due to the financial incentives to bring up an issue and the ability of whistleblowers to bypass the company's internal processes. The fear is that these awards may encourage more issues to be raised in an independent process—which may in fact weaken, rather than strengthen, the procedural safeguards that are currently applied within companies. Furthermore, they may cause issues to be disclosed prematurely, before the relevant facts and circumstances have been ascertained.</p>
<p class="para">In response, companies are taking steps to emphasize their existing internal processes. They are strengthening their tone at the top, encouraging an open atmosphere for raising issues, and emphasizing a clear anti-retaliation policy. They also are re-examining all of their internal investigation processes and ensuring that they provide a viable alternative so that whistleblowers will not feel the necessity to proceed directly to the SEC or CFTC with their concerns.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c22-6">COST OF COMPLIANCE</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given the explosion of new regulations in the past decade, the cost of compliance has definitely increased for the vast majority of companies—with no end in sight to the additional burdens that legislators and regulators will be imposing in the future. However, few companies today can quantify their total costs of compliance, much less compare their costs from year to year. This undoubtedly will change as CFOs focus more on this cost category going forward.</p>
<p class="para">The costs of compliance include expenses related to prevention and detection, as well as those related to remediation of issues. CFOs should scrutinize the mix of spending, remaining mindful of the proverbial adage that an up-front investment in prevention is much more cost-effective than spending to cure a problem.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should determine whether they can reduce their company's expenditures through streamlining processes, eliminating redundancies, implementing staffing strategies, or realizing other efficiencies. Because the costs of compliance tend not to produce any incremental revenue, any savings that can be engineered likely will flow directly to the bottom line.</p>
