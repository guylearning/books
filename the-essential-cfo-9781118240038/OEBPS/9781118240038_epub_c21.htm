<p class="chaptertitle">Chapter Twenty-One</p>
<p class="chaptertitle">Implementing Sarbanes-Oxley</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT (SOX) was enacted on July 30, 2002, in the wake of a raft of notorious corporate scandals—including Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom—as well as the dissolution of Arthur Andersen.</p>
<p class="para">The enactment of SOX has resulted in profound changes in the priorities for CFOs and their financial organizations, as well as the nature of their interactions with boards of directors—especially audit committees—and external auditors. It also has caused significant changes in the financial organization's procedures.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c21-1">OVERVIEW OF PROVISIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The main provisions of SOX—which apply to public, but not private companies—include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Accounting Oversight:</span> Establishes the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which provides independent oversight of public accounting firms.</li><li><span class="bold">Auditor Independence:</span> Sets forth standards for limiting conflicts of interest with external auditors.</li><li><span class="bold">Certifications:</span> Requires that a company's CEO and CFO certify the quarterly and annual financial statements.</li><li><span class="bold">Financial Reporting Controls:</span> Imposes new testing and reporting requirements concerning the adequacy of a company's financial controls.</li><li><span class="bold">Disclosures:</span> Stipulates increased disclosures such as off-balance-sheet transactions, material contracts, and insider transactions.</li><li><span class="bold">Analyst Conflicts:</span> Defines codes of conduct for securities analysts, including disclosures of conflicts of interest.</li><li><span class="bold">Whistleblower Communications and Protections:</span> Mandates whistleblower hot lines, establishes criminal penalties for interfering with investigations, and provides protections for whistleblowers.</li></ul>

<p class="para">In some companies, the development and implementation of these new requirements have been led by the internal audit staff, while in other companies the responses to SOX have been coordinated by a specific individual who has been assigned responsibility, usually reporting to the corporate controller. In still other cases—particularly within financial services or other regulated companies—the primary responsibility for implementing SOX has rested with the chief compliance officer.</p>
<p class="para">Irrespective of the method of implementation, the compliance with the new requirements has been a major effort—resulting in altered behaviors and new ways of doing things—and a significant investment of resources. It has also changed the nature of the CFO's relationships with the external auditors and the audit committee, generally causing their interactions to be much more formal and arm's length.</p>
<p class="para">Of all the changes wrought by SOX, the most impactful to CFOs have been the provisions related to auditor independence, financial statement certifications, and internal controls.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c21-2">AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Title II of SOX establishes requirements for auditor independence, including prohibitions on many types of consulting services for auditing clients, acceleration of the rotation of auditing partners on an account, procedures for approving a company's external auditing firm, and requirements for regular communications by the external auditors to the audit committee.</p>
<p class="para">As a result of these new requirements, the external auditors generally have a more arm's-length relationship with the CFO, more direct interactions with the audit committee, and additional safeguards against any conflicts of interest. For example, external auditors can no longer provide internal audit outsourcing for their clients. However, they can perform certain audit-related activities, such as providing tax and acquisition services.</p>
<p class="para">To comply with these restrictions, audit committees regularly review the activities performed by the external auditors and have established procedures to pre-approve any services to be performed by the external auditing firm. They have also instituted formal procedures for approving all fees paid to the external auditors.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, they have established processes for approving the renewals of the auditor engagements each year, including due diligence reviews and investigations of any potential conflicts of interest. For the most part, CFOs have advocated continuity in their auditing firms, but they must consciously and deliberately renew their recommendation each year. However, while CFOs can offer their recommendation, under SOX the responsibility for the engagement and compensation of the external auditing firm explicitly rests with the audit committee.</p>
<p class="para">At this stage of the SOX implementation, the audit committee's enforcement of auditor independence has become fairly routine; however, this topic typically requires some attention by the committee at nearly every meeting and the committee chair is often called on to approve actions between meetings.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, the auditing firms have instituted formal procedures for communicating with their clients, ensuring that their written reports conform to the regulations or guidelines set forth by SOX, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the PCAOB. They also provide mandated written communications to the audit committee on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="para">Because of the sheer volume and the time-consuming nature of all the procedural requirements, audit committees are hard-pressed to focus sufficiently on the material issues related to a company's financial statements and its control environment. Therefore, in partnership with the audit committee chair, CFOs should help to ensure that the agendas do not become too bogged down in procedural details and should seek to facilitate rich discussions concerning the company's key accounting and control issues.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c21-3">CERTIFICATION OF FINANCIALS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another major change in SOX was the requirement under Section 302 for the CEO and CFO to certify the quarterly and annual financial statements, stating that they are “responsible for establishing and maintaining financial controls” and “have designed such internal controls to ensure that material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to such officers.”</p>
<p class="para">In most public companies, it is virtually impossible for the CEO and CFO to comply with this requirement without relying heavily on other executives, as well as the officers and managers throughout the financial organization. Therefore, CFOs have instituted two procedures, in particular, to provide comfort to the certifiers of the company's financials.</p>
<p class="para">First, they have established <span class="italic">disclosure committees,</span> consisting of representatives from all parts of the company who can discuss any items or events that potentially should be disclosed in the financial statements or otherwise. By routinely reviewing the potential disclosure requirements surrounding business, financial, or legal developments, these committees provide an early warning system concerning potential issues and ensure consistency in the criteria and processes for their review.</p>
<p class="para">As a best practice, the disclosure committees operate independently from the CFO, providing an objective source of information and judgments. They are a valuable source of intelligence and positive contributors to enterprise risk management.</p>
<p class="para">Second, they have established <span class="italic">internal representations</span> whereby the layers within the financial organization certify the financial information under their purview. Most companies now have procedures in place to obtain these cascading certifications in writing each quarter—usually through emails—thereby bringing to light any potential issues that could cause someone to hesitate, or even refuse, to certify the financial statements.</p>
<p class="para">These formal requirements for each person to certify results give substantial comfort to CEOs and CFOs, who appreciate the affirmations that the financial information has been carefully reviewed at each stage of its preparation. This process also reinforces a culture of accountability, which is the bedrock of a robust control environment.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c21-4">ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROLS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Effective as of 2004, Section 404 of SOX established a requirement for management to provide an annual report to the SEC that assesses the “effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting.” Without question, this has been the most burdensome of all the SOX provisions, requiring a major effort by CFOs to comply with its requirements.</p>
<p class="para">It has resulted in material incremental costs for most companies and has caused significant alterations in routine processes, especially in the requirements for additional testing and documentation. To the critics, these requirements have been more form than substance and their benefits have been outweighed by the costs.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, it is indisputable that some good things have emanated from the Section 404 requirements. They have caused CFOs to focus on their key control processes—identifying cumbersome processes, faulty procedures, or inadequate technology. Moreover, they have motivated further automation in processes, substantially reducing the risk of errors.</p>
<p class="para">While the initial assessments were a major distraction for the financial organization, it is irrefutable that they have led to improved processes, including greater documentation, which can facilitate outsourcing and other efficiency gains. Whether these benefits were worth their costs is another question, but at least it wasn't a total waste of time and resources.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, the costs of compliance have declined over time. First, as companies have gained more experience in implementation, they have been able to reduce the number of control processes that are considered “key” and that require annual testing. Second, once the processes have been revamped, they generally require less remediation going forward. Third, when the PCAOB approved Auditing Standard No. 5, this allowed the external auditors to rely more on the companies' tests—reducing both the cost and the time commitment to achieve compliance.</p>
<p class="h2">Identification of Deficiencies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As part of the of the Section 404 requirements, the testing procedures have highlighted areas of weakness in a company's control environment. This in turn has helped CFOs to focus their management oversight in areas of higher concern and has led in many cases to targeted investments in technology tools that can enhance the accuracy and timeliness of their financial statement preparations.</p>
<p class="para">The control issues are arrayed each year according to the following hierarchy of definitions that is set forth in Statement of Auditing Standards 115:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Control Deficiency:</span> A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis.</li><li><span class="bold">Significant Deficiency:</span> A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.</li><li><span class="bold">Material Weakness:</span> A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.</li></ul>

<p class="para">Because material weaknesses must be disclosed in a company's external financial reporting, they are anathema to CFOs, who usually establish a stated goal of having none. Likewise, while significant deficiencies are not as serious a blemish as material weaknesses, the fact that they must be disclosed to the audit committee gives them undesired visibility. They also run the risk of turning into a material weakness.</p>
<p class="para">Understandably, CFOs will seek to remedy a material weakness or significant deficiency as soon as possible, especially if it can be accomplished before the end of the current fiscal year. Until the remediation has been achieved and confirmed by the company's external auditors, it will be a continuous topic for discussion with the audit committee—which is not how CFOs like to spend their time with the committee.</p>
<p class="para">Compared with most other financial functions, the tax area has been a relatively frequent source of significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the SOX reporting. As a result, many CFOs have felt the need to escalate their focus on tax accounting—in some cases shifting the leadership from a tax planning specialist to someone with a background in financial reporting. They have also strengthened the ties between the tax and controllership functions.</p>
<p class="h2">Ongoing Assessments of Controls</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">At this stage of implementation, CFOs are generally reconciled to their ongoing commitment to comply with the Section 404 requirements; indeed, they may need to guard against complacency within the financial organization. They generally need to ensure that their processes continue to be brought up to date and that they are functioning consistently and accurately, as verified by the annual testing procedures.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, CFOs should reinforce the advantages of robust processes throughout the financial organization, including the geographic locations and business activities that do not meet the thresholds to require verification through the Section 404 assessments. Greater automation, for example, is likely to be valuable wherever it's applied.</p>
<p class="h2">Application to Smaller Companies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">After a series of postponements, the SEC has <span class="italic">permanently exempted</span> smaller companies (non-accelerated filers) from the Section 404 requirements. This makes sense because the fixed costs of compliance make it hard to justify the cost/benefit trade-offs for these smaller companies. Nevertheless, both smaller public companies and private companies, including nonprofits, can benefit from the disciplined approach to internal controls that is encouraged by the SOX legislation.</p>
<p class="para">In particular, the CFOs of smaller companies can take to heart the best practices from the SOX procedures: namely, the greater focus on automation and the need to document methodologies and processes. Especially as the accounting standards become more focused on fair value determinations, it also makes sense for all CFOs to ensure that these judgments are applied consistently and appropriately.</p>
