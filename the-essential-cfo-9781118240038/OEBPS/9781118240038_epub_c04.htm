<p class="chaptertitle">Estimating the  Cost of Capital</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL is the fundamental building block for capital allocations—providing analytical consistency across the potential investment alternatives and facilitating comparisons among alternatives that have differing time horizons and risk profiles.</p>
<p class="para">It also provides a basis for comparing reinvestments in the business through capital expenditures or acquisitions versus the return of cash to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. Unless an investment or acquisition earns the company's cost of capital, shareholders would be better off to receive the cash.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c04-1">WACC FORMULA</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Today most companies estimate their cost of capital through the <span class="italic">capital asset pricing model.</span> This model uses a relatively straightforward and well-accepted formula to arrive at an estimate of the company's <span class="italic">weighted-average cost of capital (WACC).</span> The variables in this formula can be expressed as follows:</p><div class="list"><div class="item1"><span class="bold">L:</span> The targeted percentage of debt leverage in the company's market capitalization
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">R:</span> The risk-free rate of interest, typically measured by the 10-year Treasury rate
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">C:</span> The pre-tax cost of debt, reflecting the company's estimated marginal interest rate for debt financing
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">M:</span> The market's expectation for equity market returns, typically assumed to be 6 to 7 percentage points over the risk-free rate of interest
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">B:</span> The company's beta, which is a measure of the correlation of its stock price with the market
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">T:</span> The company's marginal tax rate
</div>

</div>

<p class="para">Using the above variables, the algebraic formula for the company's WACC can be shown as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Cost of Debt = <span class="italic">C</span> × (1 − <span class="italic">T</span>)</p>
<p class="center">Cost of Equity = <span class="italic">B</span> × (<span class="italic">M</span> − <span class="italic">R</span>) + <span class="italic">R</span></p>
<p class="center">Cost of Capital = <span class="italic">L</span> × (Cost of Debt) + (1 − <span class="italic">L</span>) × (Cost of Equity)</p>
<p class="h2">Example of Cost of Capital Calculation</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Let's assume that the risk-free rate is 3 percent; the company's pre-tax cost of debt is 6 percent; the market's expectation for equity returns is 10 percent; the company's beta is 1.25; and the company's marginal tax rate is 35 percent. In this case, if the company is targeting 30 percent of its capital structure as debt and 70 percent as equity, its cost of capital can be estimated as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Cost of Debt = 6.00% × (1.00 − .35) = 3.90%</p>
<p class="center">Cost of Equity = 1.25 × (10.00% − 3.00%) + 3.00% = 11.75%</p>
<p class="center">Cost of Capital = .3 × 3.90% + .7 × 11.75% = 1.17% + 8.23% = 9.40%</p>
<p class="h2">Updates and Validation</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs will update their cost of capital calculations periodically, not only for changes in the market environment, but also to reflect any revisions in the company's capital structure strategies—such as the target percentage of debt in its market capitalization—and to incorporate a more recent calculation of the company's beta.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, they may seek third-party validation of their WACC estimates from time to time, asking investment bankers or consultants to make an independent calculation.</p>
<p class="h2">Betas</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Betas vary among industries and companies, reflecting differences in their sensitivity to the economic or financial environment. A beta over 1.00 means that a stock moves more than the market, indicating greater market risk, while a beta less than 1.00 means that a stock moves less than the market, indicating lower market risk.</p>
<p class="para">Betas are also affected by company-specific factors, including the company's debt leverage, with greater leverage correlating with a higher beta. And they can fluctuate over time, reflecting both industry and company-specific developments and trends.</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>

<p class="h2">Sources of Betas</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For public companies, CFOs can obtain betas from third-party providers of market data who compute the correlations of a company's share price movements with the stock market, as measured by a broad market index such as the S&amp;P 500. The sources for betas include Bloomberg, FactSet, and Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="para">For private companies or divisions of public companies, CFOs can extrapolate their beta from comparisons with the betas for public companies in similar industries and businesses. However, they need to adjust for differences in debt leverage.</p>
<p class="h2">Unlevered Betas</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In adjusting for differences in debt leverage, CFOs should compute an unlevered beta and then relever the beta to reflect the target capital structure for the private company or division. The steps can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Unlevered Beta = Beta / [1 + (Debt / Equity) × (1 − Tax Rate)]</p>
<p class="center">Relevered Beta = Unlevered Beta × [1 + (Debt / Equity) × (1 − Tax Rate)]</p>
<p class="h2">Example of Unlevered Beta</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Let's assume that the company has a beta of 1.25, a target debt leverage ratio of 30 percent, and a marginal tax rate of 35 percent. The unlevered and relevered betas can be calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Unlevered Beta = 1.25/[1 + (30/70) × .65] = 0.98</p>
<p class="center">Relevered Beta = 0.98 × [1 + (30/70) × .65] = 1.25</p>
<p class="h2">Prospective versus Historical Betas</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs normally rely on betas that are calculated using historical market data. In contrast, some analysts and bankers prefer to use a <span class="italic">prospective beta.</span> This concept was pioneered by Barra (now MSCI Barra), which uses market data and regression analyses to predict the future market correlations. This approach can yield some interesting insights—especially in managing investment portfolios—but lacks the objectivity and precision that CFOs normally prefer in their financial analyses.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, CFOs may want to adjust their historical beta to reflect a significant change in their target debt ratio or business mix—perhaps due to a major acquisition or divestiture. In this case, the CFO could calculate the unlevered betas, then combine them into a blended unlevered beta, and then relever the blended unlevered beta to reflect the new target debt ratio.</p>
<p class="para">For example, let's assume that the company's beta is 1.25 (unlevered = .98); it is acquiring a business with a beta of 1.40 (unlevered = 1.10) that will comprise 20 percent of the combined company; and that, to finance the acquisition, it is increasing its target debt leverage from 30 to 40 percent. In this case, the calculations would be as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Blended Unlevered Beta = (.8 × 0.98) + (.2 × 1.10) = 1.00</p>
<p class="center">Blended Relevered Beta = 1.00 × [1 + (40/60) × .65] = 1.43</p>
<p class="h1" id="c04-2">HURDLE RATES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In applying their cost of capital to investment decisions, CFOs often choose to round up to the nearest whole percentage point and then add a few percentage points to establish a “hurdle rate” for assessing potential projects. They normally justify adding this “fudge factor” to offset the tendency for project sponsors to be optimistic in their projections; they believe that this will help the company to prioritize its investment alternatives—weeding out lower return projects.</p>
<p class="para">However, while setting a higher hurdle rate may seem like a conservative approach and a way to facilitate the rationing of a company's scarce capital, it can produce very misleading results. Because of the complex manner in which the discount rate can affect present value calculations, using a higher hurdle rate may be either overcompensating or undercompensating for the perceived optimism in the forecast.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, adding too much of an increment to the cost of capital may incentivize excessive risk taking in the types of projects that are pursued or cause project sponsors to be unrealistically aggressive in their business and financial assumptions.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c04-3">RISK PREMIUMS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another common approach is to vary the cost of capital to reflect the perceived risk of a proposed investment. CFOs will either assume higher betas for riskier projects or simply add incremental risk premiums to their cost of capital. For example, they might require a higher hurdle rate for investments in new technologies or for projects that are located in developing countries.</p>
<p class="para">Applying differing risk premiums certainly can be justified as a valid theoretical approach; it's often described in academic textbooks as the preferred methodology for prioritizing among competing investment proposals, with their relative ranking determined by their risk-adjusted net present values.</p>
<p class="para">However, while applying differentiated risk premiums may make theoretical sense, most CFOs tend not to apply explicit risk adjustments. Instead, they usually employ a consistent cost of capital for evaluating their investment alternatives.</p>
<p class="h2">Less Arbitrary</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">First, it is very difficult to estimate the likely impact that an incremental investment will have on the company's cost of capital; the assignment of additional risk premiums can be relatively arbitrary, especially when the competing uses of capital are going to be considered within the context of a company's diversified portfolio of investments.</p>
<p class="h2">Better Projections</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Second, if risk premiums are added, they may cause a bias toward more aggressive assumptions. As every CFO has observed, discounted cash flow projections are often manipulated to achieve the hurdle rate; after all, no project sponsor wants to put forth a discretionary proposal that does not show it earning the company's cost of capital. Moreover, CFOs can still apply subjective judgments in comparing projects—in other words, it's better to apply subjective judgments to objective projections than objective judgments to subjective projections.</p>
<p class="h2">Less Complicated</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Third, the evaluation techniques that are based on the cost of capital—notably net present value calculations—can be extremely sensitive to myriad assumptions that drive the underlying cash flows. Adding risk premiums to the analysis makes it harder for decision makers to distinguish the extent to which the comparisons among projects are being driven by their cash flows versus the impact due to varying their risk premiums. It is usually better to show alternative discount rates as a sensitivity analysis than to bake different rates into the base case comparisons.</p>
<p class="h2">Investor Diversification</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Fourth, the company's appraisal of project risks may be inconsistent with the views of its shareholders, who can diversify the risks through their investment portfolio. For example, the company may perceive greater risk in its investments in developing countries, while shareholders may welcome the greater exposure to alternative markets and economies.</p>
<p class="h2">Staffing Constraints</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Finally, CFOs typically lack the staff resources to analyze and determine discretionary risk premiums. Given the significant and increasing demands on the financial organization and the pressures to reduce headcount, CFOs may conclude that the potential benefits from applying risk-adjusted discount rates are usually outweighed by the incremental costs.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c04-4">ACQUISITION COST OF CAPITAL</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A related question surrounds the cost of capital to be used in analyzing acquisitions. According to financial theory, an acquisition should be evaluated using the cost of capital for the target's industry or line of business. In the case of a public company, the acquisition can be evaluated using the target's actual beta, while for a private company or division, the target's beta can be extrapolated from those of comparable public companies.</p>
<p class="para">In theory, a company's beta will reflect the composite of its businesses and if it adds a new business, its beta will adjust for its new business profile; in other words, adding the target's beta will cause the acquirer's beta to increase or decrease proportionately. However, from a practical standpoint, except in the case of very material transactions, a change in beta is usually extremely hard to discern.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, evaluating acquisitions using differing costs of capital is fraught with the same issues that can complicate the evaluation of investment projects. The potential benefits from applying more analytical precision to the calculations may be more than offset by the more arbitrary and less transparent nature of the methodology and by the extra time and effort involved—especially if the company is acquiring several targets in similar or related businesses.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, unless they are considering a major—perhaps transformational— transaction in a business that is demonstrably distinct from the acquirer's current profile, CFOs should use the company's existing cost of capital for evaluating acquisitions.</p>
<p class="para">However, they should consider the relative riskiness of an acquisition as one of the criteria in deciding whether to proceed—including their focus on execution risks and other considerations that aren't captured in the target's beta. They should also be attuned to the sensitivities of the projected returns to alternative scenarios and alternative discount rates.</p>
<p class="h2">Major Transactions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In the case of a major transaction, CFOs can use the target's cost of capital to analyze its discounted cash flows. An alternative approach is to compute a new blended cost of capital for the company. To compute the blended cost of capital, the CFO would revise the company's beta, use the new capital structure target, and reflect any change in the company's cost of debt.</p>
<p class="para">For example, let's assume that the company makes a major acquisition that causes its cost of equity to increase from 11.75 percent to 13.00 percent; its debt leverage target to increase from 30 percent to 40 percent; and its pre-tax cost of debt to increase from 6.00 percent to 6.50 percent. Its new cost of capital can be computed as follows:</p>
