<p class="chaptertitle">Developing Financing Strategies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">WITHIN THE CONTEXT of their leverage targets, CFOs will focus on the target mix of securities in the capital structure. Their overarching objective is to facilitate the strategic plan objectives, ensuring that the company has adequate financing at a reasonable cost, with limited volatility.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c13-1">FINANCING PRINCIPLES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In developing their financing strategies, CFOs will apply core principles to guide their decision making. These principles should include keeping it simple, preserving flexibility, continuing to evolve, and reacting opportunistically.</p>
<p class="h2">Keeping It Simple</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should establish a straightforward capital structure that is easily understood and communicated. Common stock and straight debt should be the twin pillars of this capital structure; they are the simplest to execute and, in combination, usually produce the lowest cost of capital. However, convertibles, warrants, and straight preferred stock are legitimate alternatives that—under the right circumstances—can expand a CFO's access to funding or provide lower-cost capital.</p>
<p class="para">As a general rule, CFOs should require complex securities to satisfy a higher burden of proof than plain vanilla alternatives, and they should be cautious in their willingness to serve as a trailblazer for an untested form of financing. Innovation can make sense, but only if the financing technique has been proven in the market and designed to meet clearly stated corporate finance objectives—rather than intended to exploit loopholes in the tax or accounting rules.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, CFOs should look out for “hidden costs” embedded in more complex securities and make sure to understand the potential risks, thus avoiding surprises down the road.</p>
<p class="h2">Preserving Flexibility</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should also maintain flexibility in their financing strategies. It is usually better to accept a higher cost of financing than to agree to conditions—such as restrictive covenants—that may inhibit a company's business or financial objectives in the future. This is consistent with the CFO's primary objective of advancing the company's strategic plan.</p>
<p class="para">As another example, CFOs should treasure debt call provisions as an especially valuable corporate finance tool. Many CFOs learned this lesson the hard way during the 1980s when they issued 30-year debt that was non-redeemable for life. While eliminating the conventional redemption feature in year 10 provided CFOs with a lower interest rate on the debt, this cost savings was far outweighed by their subsequent inability to redeem this debt—which typically had an interest rate of around 10 percent—during the disinflation era of the 1990s.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, at the time that they entered into these agreements, it seemed inconceivable that interest rates would decline so precipitously. In contrast, the CFOs who paid a higher interest rate for more flexible call provisions looked awfully smart in hindsight.</p>
<p class="h2">Continuing to Evolve</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should consider their financing strategies to be constantly evolving. As their company matures and as conditions change in the financial markets, they should review potential strategies for lowering their cost of capital, strengthening their liquidity, or enhancing their long-term flexibility.</p>
<p class="para">In addition to acting proactively from a position of strength, CFOs may also need to respond nimbly to adversity, seeking to preserve the company's credit standing and avoiding threats to the company's strategic plan.</p>
<p class="para">In general, CFOs should always be looking forward and anticipating their capital structure requirements for the future. This involves monitoring their expected cash needs and relating them to the expected conditions in the economy and financial markets.</p>
<p class="h2">Reacting Opportunistically</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Most important, CFOs should maintain ample flexibility in the execution of their financing strategies, with the latitude to respond quickly to market opportunities. Working with up-to-date market intelligence from their bankers and other external advisors, CFOs can directly and materially impact a company's financing costs through the timing and manner in which they access the capital markets—representing a very tangible example of how CFOs can add significant shareholder value.</p>
<p class="para">For this reason, CFOs should strive to obtain advance agreement from the board of directors concerning their financing strategies and establish streamlined authorizations to implement these strategies in a flexible, opportunistic manner. For example, the board might authorize the chair of the finance or executive committee to approve specific financings within an agreed-upon framework.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c13-2">DEBT FINANCING</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Straight debt is a primary component of most capital structures. It can be issued privately or publicly, with a wide choice of maturities, structures, and terms.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs must make a number of decisions concerning their debt financing strategies, including the types of debt, the maturity structure, the mix of floating and fixed interest rates, and the possibility of issuing debt in a foreign currency.</p>
<p class="h2">Types of Debt</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The CFO's first question to answer is, What is the desired mix among the types of debt that can be issued? The basic alternatives are secured debt, senior debt, subordinated debt, and capital leases.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Secured debt</span> is backed by all or a portion of a company's assets (e.g., accounts receivable, inventories, equipment, real estate, fixed assets). The company retains ownership of the assets, but the creditors have preference in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Senior debt</span> does not have specific collateral ascribed to it. In bankruptcy, unsecured senior debt is generally pari passu with the company's general credit obligations—such as amounts owed to suppliers—and with obligations owed to the company's executives through deferred compensation or non-qualified pension plans.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Subordinated debt</span> can include differentiated levels—such as senior subordinated debt, junior subordinated debt, and mezzanine debt—and is the most vulnerable debt in the event of bankruptcy, although the holders often will receive equity in a Chapter 11 reorganization.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Capital leases</span> are long-term commitments that appear on the company's balance sheet as a form of debt obligation. They can include sale/leaseback transactions where ownership of an asset (e.g., a headquarters building) is sold to a lessor and then leased back to the company. Other examples include entering into capital leases to obtain transportation or industrial equipment or a warehouse facility. Often these financings are motivated by tax considerations.</p>
<p class="para">The CFO's choices among these types of debt will depend mostly on the strength of the company's credit quality and its access to financing. In most cases, the basic tradeoff will be between cost and flexibility. For example, secured financing is generally available at a lower cost than unsecured debt, but can constrain the company's financial flexibility. In contrast, subordinated debt provides more flexibility, but comes at a higher cost; it will also include restrictive covenants that can constrain the company if things do not go as planned. And CFOs of strong credits can enjoy the luxury of having all their needs met through senior unsecured debt—eschewing either secured or subordinated debt altogether—which generally accommodates an attractive blend of both cost and flexibility objectives.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should seek to develop a long-term game plan around these alternative types of debt, determining the best package to meet the company's funding needs. The danger is that a piecemeal approach can end up costing much more in the form of either greater interest expense or less financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="h2">Debt Maturity Structure</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another key question is, What should be the maturity structure for the debt? The first priority is to avoid excessive concentration of maturities, especially within the next one to five years. It is a well-acknowledged truism that companies are more likely to get into financial trouble due to a liquidity shortfall than due to an increase in interest rates. Therefore, CFOs usually seek longer-term maturities that are spread out over time, thereby mitigating a potential liquidity crunch that will require substantial refinancing—perhaps during inhospitable market conditions.</p>
<p class="para">A second priority is to seek an average maturity that relates logically to the company's business horizon (such as a patent approval process for a pharmaceutical company) or to the nature of its assets (such as an investment portfolio for a financial services company).</p>
<p class="para">CFOs will often express their debt maturity objective in terms of its “duration,” which is equal to the average life of the present values of the debt's cash flows. Duration indicates not only the average length of time that the debt is outstanding, but also the sensitivity of its market value to changes in interest rates. For example, if a debt security has duration of four years, a 1 percent increase in the market interest rate will cause a 4 percent decrease in its market value.</p>
<p class="para">Another consideration is that longer dated securities usually have a higher interest cost than debt with a shorter maturity—reflecting a positive yield curve—due to the “liquidity preference function” (which states that investors normally demand a higher interest rate for a longer time commitment). For example, during the 2001–2010 time period, the average year-end rate for 10-year Treasuries was 155 basis points above the average rate for 2-year Treasuries.</p>
<p class="h2">Fixed versus Floating Rate Debt</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A third key question is, What is the desired mix between fixed and floating rate debt? This decision represents a clear tradeoff between risk and reward: Floating rate securities historically have produced lower interest rates over the long term, but introduce greater uncertainty and volatility concerning the company's interest payments in the future.</p>
<p class="para">In answering this question, CFOs should consider the company's financial strength, the stability and predictability of its earnings and cash flows, the nature of its assets, and the company's tolerance for risk. CFOs should include this topic in their review of enterprise risks, and make sure that the CEO and board of directors are comfortable with their strategy.</p>
<p class="para">For CFOs of large companies that have access to the derivatives markets, a popular strategy is to issue long-term fixed rate debt securities and then to enter into interest rate swap agreements that convert the interest expense into a floating rate. In this way, they protect the company's liquidity, but benefit from the cost advantages of floating rate debt. For CFOs of smaller companies that do not have access to the derivatives markets, a similar strategy can be implemented through a bank term loan that features a floating rate.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, while floating rate debt normally is less expensive, CFOs should be ready to seize opportunities to lock in rates at historically low levels. For example, given the extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus in the aftermath of the financial crisis, interest costs have been kept artificially low for an extended period—which may make it prudent for CFOs to fix a larger portion of their debt before the eventual return to normalcy.</p>
<p class="h2">Foreign Currency Debt</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For companies that have major currency translation exposures due to their international operations, CFOs may choose to issue part of their debt in foreign markets, thereby achieving a natural hedge against these exposures. Another alternative is to issue the debt in their home country, but then swap the interest and principal payments into the foreign currency through forward contracts.</p>
<p class="para">However, these strategies will usually only make economic sense if there is a liquid debt market within the foreign country or if there is an active derivatives market in the foreign currency. In addition, while most companies typically will hedge part or all of their “transaction” currency exposures, most do not hedge their “translation” exposures. Because issuing locally denominated debt can be equivalent to hedging a translation exposure, this may be viewed as inconsistent with the company's overall currency management strategies.</p>
<p class="para">Also, while denominating debt in foreign currencies can make economic sense if it creates a hedge against transaction exposures—such as hedging a stream of royalty payments or funding an offshore acquisition—hedging translation exposures can result in a mismatch with cash requirements. For example, if a company is not repatriating its retained earnings from a foreign country and it is paying its foreign-denominated interest with parent company cash, then it is using a cash hedge to offset an accounting exposure.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, employing foreign-denominated debt adds some complexity to the company's financial management, including the need to comply with the rules and documentation requirements for obtaining hedge accounting treatment. CFOs may conclude that the potential advantages of the hedge are outweighed by the incremental costs and administrative distractions involved.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c13-3">EQUITY FINANCING</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Most equity financing is accomplished through common stock issuances. However, other equity alternatives include convertibles, warrants, and preferred stock.</p>
<p class="h2">Common Stock</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In public companies, common stock normally is issued as one class that has equal voting rights among all of the shareholders. Therefore, the financing strategies involving common stock are usually quite straightforward: When to issue the stock, how much to issue, and to whom?</p>
<p class="para">A few companies with a legacy of family ownership—especially in the media industry—maintain separate classes of stock with differing voting rights. In addition, dual classes can be used by founders or early investors in private companies as a way to retain control through rounds of financing.</p>
<p class="para">However, most investors object to the dual classes as representing poor corporate governance and the shares with lower voting rights usually will trade at a discount (but they typically have more liquidity than the higher voting shares). Consequently, dual classes are infrequently used in connection with initial public offerings (IPOs) and are restricted to IPOs that enjoy strong investor appetite (e.g., Google).</p>
<p class="para">In theory, companies can also issue classes of stock with differing dividend rates or other differentiated financial policies. Indeed, they can even have separate financial statements, which was the basis for issuances of “<span class="italic">targeted</span>” or “<span class="italic">tracking</span>” stock that was intended to highlight the differences between disparate businesses in a single corporate entity.</p>
<p class="para">The progenitor of targeted stock was the Hughes division of General Motors, with several other companies issuing similar securities in the 1980s. For example, Marathon established dual classes to distinguish its exploration and production business from its refining operations.</p>
<p class="para">However, targeted stocks proved to have governance and valuation issues and most have since been redeemed. Today it is generally considered preferable to establish a separate stock by spinning off one of the businesses or by issuing a minority interest through an initial public offering (an “equity carve out”).</p>
<p class="h2">Convertibles</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Convertible debt and convertible preferred securities are hybrids that contain elements of both equity and fixed income securities. They can be attractive to issuers if they expand the size of their financings or facilitate funding from an alternative source of capital, such as a private equity firm. Moreover, they are less dilutive to shares outstanding than common stock and their interest or dividend costs are less than would be required for a fixed income alternative.</p>
<p class="para">Investors typically view convertibles as giving them a minimum return, plus the upside represented by a call option on the company's stock. Alternatively, if convertibles pay no or very low interest or dividends, investors may view them primarily as an equity security that contains an embedded put option whose strike price is equal to the face value of the debt or preferred.</p>
<p class="para">From the issuer's perspective, the biggest disadvantage with convertibles is that they usually are constructed in a “heads you win, tails I lose” manner. If the company does better than expected, it issues common stock to the investor at a bargain price. In contrast, if the company encounters financial difficulties, it must continue to pay the interest or dividend and, more important, must pay the principal at maturity. Moreover, if the convertible securities are publicly held, they can add complexity to the CFO's future financing decisions, as savvy investors may concoct trading strategies that take advantage of inefficiencies among markets. Finally, investors in convertibles usually do not pay the full intrinsic value of the options, especially if they have negotiating leverage in a difficult market environment.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, convertibles can make sense in some situations. First, they can facilitate an investment by a venture capital or private equity firm. In this case, the convertible usually does not pay interest or dividends, and the protection of principal in the capital structure hierarchy may induce the investor to commit funds to the company. Second, in some market environments, investors may have such a strong appetite for convertibles that the terms of the securities are quite favorable to the issuer. Finally, banks and other regulated companies may issue convertible securities that can qualify as a lower cost source of regulatory capital.</p>
<p class="para">If CFOs are considering the issuance of convertibles, they will be well-advised to determine the separate valuations of the equity, options, and fixed income components of the securities—thus understanding their intrinsic value in comparison to the proceeds being raised. Also, they should carefully review the accounting and tax treatment—which can be quite complicated and strongly influenced by the manner in which the securities are constructed.</p>
<p class="h2">Warrants</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Warrants are long-term call options issued by a company, either as stand-alone securities, or more likely, as an inducement to a lender to provide long-term subordinated debt financing. If a company cannot afford to pay the level of interest expense that would be required for a market rate transaction, warrants represent a vehicle for bridging this value gap. For example, warrants are often included with mezzanine debt financings and are usually detachable from the debt instrument.</p>
<p class="para">As with convertibles, CFOs should be sure to understand the intrinsic value of the warrants—which can be determined by a Black-Scholes or a binomial decision tree analysis—and that they thoroughly explore the accounting and tax treatment.</p>
<p class="h2">Preferred Stock</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Straight preferred stock is subordinate to unsecured debt in the capital structure, but it has a liquidation preference that ranks above common stock. It can either be perpetual or have a stated maturity, often 10 years. Its dividend payments are usually cumulative, which means that any unpaid preferred dividends must be paid before dividends are paid to common shareholders. In addition, preferred stock holders normally are granted board seats if a specified number of dividend payments are missed.</p>
<p class="para">For the most part, CFOs consider preferred stock to be a relatively expensive fixed income security, largely because the dividend payments are not tax deductible—although clever tax lawyers have designed some exceptions to this general rule through complex configurations. Nevertheless, issuing straight preferred stock can make sense in certain circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the issuer is <span class="italic">not expected to be a taxpayer</span> for the foreseeable future (usually due to tax loss carry forwards) and thus can't take advantage of the interest deduction on debt.</li><li>If the preferred stock is sold to a corporate investor who will sufficiently compensate the issuer for the <span class="italic">dividends received deduction</span> (generally 70 percent of preferred dividends are excluded from the taxable income of a  U. S. corporation, or 80 percent if the corporate investor owns more than 20 percent of the issuer's common stock).</li><li>If the preferred stock is sold to individual investors who can benefit from the <span class="italic">lower federal</span> <span class="italic">tax rate</span> on dividends compared with ordinary income rates. For example, the issuer can offer preferred stock with a $25 par value that is designed to appeal to retail investors.</li><li>If the issuance of preferred stock is a <span class="italic">condition to obtaining subordinated debt financing.</span> For example, if a lender is insisting on a greater equity cushion, issuing preferred stock can be a less costly method of satisfying this condition than issuing common stock.</li><li>If the preferred stock is <span class="italic">treated as regulatory capital</span> that is less expensive than common stock. For example, banks have issued trust preferred stock as a way to obtain inexpensive Tier 1 capital. (However, this regulatory treatment is being phased out.)</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Auction Preferred</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In the past, many companies and governmental entities in the United States issued auction preferred stock, which featured a floating dividend rate that was reset through a series of scheduled auctions. It was marketed to corporations and individuals as a short-term investment option to invest their surplus cash at favorable after-tax rates of return.</p>
<p class="para">However, the auction preferred market experienced a dramatic meltdown during the financial crisis, with issuers unable to refinance the preferred and investors being stuck with relatively illiquid and much devalued securities. It is highly unlikely that this market will reopen in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c13-4">OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Off balance sheet financing may only appear in the footnotes, but it represents a financial commitment that CFOs should consider as part of their capital structure. Indeed, banks and rating agencies will explicitly consider these commitments in their credit assessments.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, CFOs should compare these arrangements with other financing alternatives and because they typically have higher costs than alternative funding sources, they should only be advocated where they are satisfying a legitimate business purpose—such as enhancing operational flexibility or facilitating a joint venture partnership.</p>
<p class="h2">Special Purpose Entities</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Although the promulgation of new accounting rules (notably FIN 46) has dramatically curtailed the use of the exotic and controversial off balance sheet financing vehicles of days past (such as Enron's infamous Raptors), CFOs should be ever vigilant in safeguarding the company against the potential abuses of newly designed structures. In particular, CFOs should ensure that any structures proposed by investment banks or other advisors have valid business purposes and are not intended simply to circumvent accounting, regulatory, or legal constraints.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, a company's participation in a joint venture or other form of business partnership can make sense as a vehicle for sharing costs and risks between two or more parties, as well as a legitimate way to utilize tax benefits (such as net operating losses).</p>
<p class="para">Depending on which party has the greater ownership interest, the joint venture may not be reflected on the company's balance sheet. Thus, even though it is off balance sheet financing, this accounting treatment is the result—not the motivation—for the venture: it fulfills a valid business purpose that was facilitated by the financial structure.</p>
<p class="para">Likewise, securitizations can be a good method for freeing up debt capacity—provided that they truly represent a transfer of risk to the third party. CFOs should focus on the recourse arrangements, in particular, to ensure that the transaction fulfills valid business objectives.</p>
<p class="h2">Operating Lease Rentals</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Operating leases are another example of an off balance sheet financing alternative that can make business sense. By renting rather than owning an asset, the CFO is making a conscious decision to incur higher long-term financing costs in exchange for greater operational flexibility. For example, renting office space can reduce a company's real estate costs: It facilitates reconfigurations of the company's real estate footprint to reflect changes in space requirements and shifts its expense base toward more variable rather than fixed cost commitments.</p>
<p class="para">As other examples, renting warehouse space can provide more flexibility in a company's supply chain and customer servicing arrangements, and renting office or industrial equipment can allow the company to adapt easily to meet new requirements or to take advantage of new technologies or product improvements.</p>
<p class="h2">Industry Norms</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For some industries, off balance sheet arrangements are an integral part of the companies' business models. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="italic">Transportation companies</span> may lease much of their equipment, such as airplanes or trucks. They often can obtain a lower cost of financing than through conventional debt and they can gain greater long-term flexibility in adjusting their fleet for volume requirements.</li><li><span class="italic">Natural resource and commodity companies</span> often use take-or-pay or requirements contracts that lock in product sales or supply arrangements over a long-term planning horizon.</li><li><span class="italic">Retail companies</span> usually lease their stores, giving them more flexibility to close down underperforming locations.</li><li><span class="italic">Oil and gas companies</span> use operating leases for drilling rigs and other equipment, giving them greater flexibility to shift the locus of their exploration and production activities.</li></ul>

<p class="para">CFOs generally should be comfortable with these industry practices that have evolved over time and recognize that deviating too greatly from the accepted norms could put their companies at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p class="h2">Outsourcing Contracts</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Off balance sheet financing arrangements can be embedded in outsourcing contracts. For example, companies can request that the outsourcing provider incur certain costs—such as severance payments to laid-off employees or rentals for dedicated facilities—and then recover these costs over the life of the outsourcing contract. These may be justifiable business arrangements, but CFOs should recognize that they implicitly represent a form of financing, which should be compared with other financing alternatives.</p>
<p class="h2">Impact on Management Compensation</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Finally, CFOs should be cognizant of the potential impact of off balance sheet structures on bonus plans or other incentive compensation. Business leaders are appropriately motivated to maximize their performance against agreed-upon targets, but sometimes the definitions for these targets can distort decision making. For example, if a company charges a cost of capital on its net assets, a business division may achieve higher profitability through an operating lease; in this case, the higher profit is due to the rentals being less that the ascribed cost of capital.</p>
<p class="para">The bottom line is that CFOs should ensure that any off balance sheet arrangements make business sense and, if necessary, recommend potential modifications to the performance criteria for incentive compensation. Given the goal of motivating good business decisions, the CFO can help define the scorecard that creates the right behavioral incentives.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c13-5">DEBT COVENANTS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Debt covenants can be important considerations in the CFO's capital structure decisions, possibly impinging on a company's ability to pursue its strategic objectives. In some cases, a CFO may strongly prefer to avoid restrictive covenants as much as possible, even if it entails a more expensive cost of capital.</p>
<p class="para">Alternatively, CFOs may choose to accept the covenants as a justifiable condition to gaining more access to debt capital at better rates. And especially for small companies or start-ups, restrictive covenants may be required to tap the debt markets in any form.</p>
<p class="para">By design, covenants come into play when something does not go as planned, which may be the very time when CFOs need the most flexibility in meeting their funding needs. This does not mean that it never makes sense to agree to potentially onerous covenants—the company may have no viable alternative—but it does mean that CFOs should carefully consider the tradeoffs involved, including contingencies that may seem improbable at the present time.</p>
<p class="h2">Maintenance Covenants</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Maintenance covenants apply at all times and are most associated with bank financing. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Leverage ratio:</span> Maximum debt to EBITDA.</li><li><span class="bold">Interest coverage ratio:</span> Minimum EBITDA to interest expense.</li><li><span class="bold">Fixed charge coverage ratio:</span> Minimum EBITDA to sum of interest expense, preferred dividends, and interest component of rentals.</li><li><span class="bold">Shareholders' equity:</span> Minimum book value of equity.</li><li><span class="bold">Debt ratings:</span> Minimum debt ratings, or else interest rates that fluctuate with changes in the debt ratings.</li><li><span class="bold">Capital expenditures:</span> Maximum amount of capital expenditures per year.</li><li><span class="bold">Material adverse change:</span> No material change in the borrower's financial condition.</li><li><span class="bold">Business activities:</span> No major change in the borrower's business description.</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Incurrence Covenants</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Incurrence covenants constrain specific actions and are normally associated with high yield financings and syndicated bank loans. Some typical examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Additional debt:</span> Prohibits new debt financings by the parent company or subsidiaries unless specified leverage or coverage ratios are met on a pro forma basis.</li><li><span class="bold">Restricted payments:</span> Prohibits dividends, share repurchases, or equity investments unless leverage or coverage tests are met and amount to less than a specified percentage of net income.</li><li><span class="bold">Negative pledge:</span> Restricts the pledging of assets as collateral in secured financings.</li><li><span class="bold">Asset sales:</span> Prohibits asset sales unless “fair value” is received and restricts the use of proceeds.</li><li><span class="bold">Affiliate transactions:</span> Requires “arms length” or “fair value” terms for any transactions with affiliated companies.</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Change of Control Provision</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another important consideration is, What happens in the event of a proposed change of control? For example, the covenants may provide that a merger or consolidation is permitted only if the acquiring company can comply with financial tests, including the borrower's debt incurrence ratios. Another alternative is to require that the credit rating of the new company is equal to, or better than, the acquired company's.</p>
<p class="para">For high yield securities, the indenture usually specifies that in the event of a change of control, the debt holders can have their securities repurchased at a price of 101 percent of their par value. This option can be especially valuable to holders of debt securities that are trading at a substantial discount to face value: It effectively transfers value to the debt holders from the shareholders, who otherwise likely could have received a higher price for their stock.</p>
<p class="h2">Covenant Negotiations</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Depending on the volatility of a company's financial results and its need to maintain financial flexibility, CFOs may seek to limit their use of financing alternatives that involve certain incurrence or maintenance tests; or more likely, they may attempt to negotiate covenants that provide the most flexibility to pursue the company's business and financial strategies.</p>
<p class="para">To a very great extent, the CFO's negotiating leverage will be a function of the company's debt ratings, with higher rated credits enjoying fewer and looser covenants. In contrast, if a company is rated below investment grade, the company generally will have little latitude to obtain a covenant package that differs from the prevailing standards in the bank loan or high yield debt markets.</p>
<p class="para">The types and terms of the required covenants tend to ebb and flow with market conditions; thus, the CFO's negotiating leverage generally will be greater when the financing markets are vibrant than during periods when market conditions are weak. This is another advantage of entering the capital markets on an opportunistic basis, creating the possibility to negotiate a less restrictive covenant package. Moreover, in favorable market environments, CFOs may have more freedom in defining the covenant terms (e.g., by establishing a higher debt leverage ratio or a lower interest coverage ratio than normally would be possible).</p>
<p class="h1" id="c13-6">DEBT REFINANCINGS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A debt refinancing can be motivated by a decline in market interest rates, by improvements in the company's financial results, or by more favorable conditions in the financial markets—as evidenced by a greater amount of debt leverage that can be financed on a given amount of earnings or by covenants or other terms that are superior to the company's existing arrangements. By executing a refinancing, CFOs can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower the annual interest expense.</li><li>Increase the amount of debt financing.</li><li>Extend the debt maturity structure.</li><li>Obtain less restrictive covenants.</li></ul>

<p class="para">Of course, refinancings will be facilitated by call provisions that allow the company to redeem the existing debt at set prices. Otherwise, much of the advantages of a refinancing will be offset by the premium required to purchase the existing debt—because its market value will have increased as a result of the lower interest rate environment.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, even if the debt is not callable, CFOs may determine that the extension of the maturity or the improvement in the covenant package is worth the incremental cost. In this case, they can repurchase the debt through the open market or else exchange a new issue of debt for the existing debt. Alternatively, they can arrange the new financing on favorable terms and hold it as cash until the existing debt matures—essentially prefunding their future financing requirements.</p>
<p class="h2">Private Equity Refinancings</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Private equity firms often use debt refinancings to restructure the capital structures of their portfolio companies, with the proceeds often used to reduce their equity investments. Given their relatively high cost of equity, the private equity firms can execute refinancings that decidedly improve their returns on investment.</p>
<p class="para">Consequently, they typically try to increase a company's earnings quickly—and thereby the amount of debt leverage that it can support—and aggressively take advantage of opportunities to refinance debt in response to market opportunities that may be prove to be fleeting.</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>
</div>

<p class="featuretitle">Example of Debt Refinancing</p>
<p class="featurepara">Let's assume that Company XYZ was acquired by a private equity firm in year 1 and that due to higher earnings and improved market conditions, it can refinance the debt in year 2. By using the proceeds to pay a dividend, the private equity firm can substantially reduce its equity investment and thereby enhance its return.</p>

<p class="h1" id="c13-7">DEBT FOR EQUITY SWAPS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For CFOs that want to lessen their debt burden, a debt for equity swap is a proven and well-accepted technique. In this transaction, a company typically issues shares of its common stock in exchange for its existing debt securities. The debt holder often can obtain a higher price for the debt than otherwise available in the open market and provided that the equity shares are reasonably liquid, can convert the shares into cash.</p>
<p class="para">At the same time, the company usually obtains equity at a better all-in price than would be available through a new issuance—saving the underwriting costs and pricing discounts associated with an equity offering—and books a profit if the debt is purchased at a discount from its face value. This can be a source of regulatory capital for banks or other regulated companies.</p>
<p class="para">While debt for equity swaps usually are negotiated as one-off transactions with debt holders, CFOs also can swap equity through an exchange offer made to all debt holders. These exchanges are subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements—such as the length of time that the offering needs to be outstanding—and may be subject to a shareholder vote. However, they can be an efficient vehicle for transforming a company's capital structure in a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p class="para">A major debt for equity exchange can be especially important for a CFO who needs to perform radical surgery on a company's capital structure within a finite time period. It also can help reassure investors that the transaction fully satisfies the company's capital requirements, thus avoiding the uncertainty and progressive dilution that can accompany a long drawn-out series of smaller transactions.</p>
<p class="h2">Fiduciary Obligations</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Major debt for equity exchanges can be very dilutive to existing shareholders, effectively transferring value to the debt holders. This can cause consternation for boards of directors who generally are charged with a fiduciary obligation to preserve and enhance shareholder value. However, the courts have ruled that at a certain point the company enters the “zone of insolvency” in which the board's obligations generally shift to preserving value for creditors and other stakeholders.</p>
<p class="h2">Rating Agency Reaction</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In what can seem like “Alice in Wonderland” logic, the rating agencies will treat a major debt for equity recapitalization as requiring an automatic debt downgrade, even if the company's credit position is strengthened materially. The agencies reason that since their debt ratings reflect the probability that debt will be repaid as scheduled at its face value, any deviations from this expectation necessitates a lower rating.</p>
<p class="para">Their treatment may seem counterintuitive, if not illogical. However, despite the lower ratings, the debt markets will reward the improved credit standing with higher valuations for the company's remaining debt. As another counterintuitive result, this higher market value for the remaining debt will result in a charge to net income for companies that mark their debt to market pursuant to FAS 159.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c13-8">BANKRUPTCY</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Although every CFO dreads the possibility, events may conspire to necessitate consideration of a bankruptcy filing. In this case, the CFO should seek to preserve as much value as possible, avoiding the dissipation that can occur as a result of prolonged uncertainty and a protracted consideration of alternatives.</p>
<p class="para">Bringing in financial experts in advance of a potential filing—along with the hiring of experienced bankruptcy counsel—usually is a wise step that can preserve value for the stakeholders. This is an area where specialized expertise and accumulated experience are essential to making the right decisions under pressure.</p>
<p class="para">Depending on the circumstances and reflecting the advice received from the company's advisors, CFOs facing a potential bankruptcy dilemma generally can consider the following four primary alternatives:</p><div class="list"><div class="item1">1.<span class="bold"> Recapitalization:</span> Avoid a bankruptcy filing, attempting to arrange a recapitalization with the support of the company's creditors. This usually involves exchanging the existing debt for a new debt issue or equity.
</div>
<div class="item1">2.<span class="bold"> Prepackaged Plan:</span> Arrange a prepackaged bankruptcy whereby the creditors and other stakeholders have agreed to a new capital structure that is effected through a court-enforced bankruptcy judgment under Chapter 11.
</div>
<div class="item1">3.<span class="bold"> Chapter 11 Filing:</span> Enter into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing that preserves the company's ability to operate post-bankruptcy as a going concern, usually with most or all of the equity going to the debt holders and other creditors. This allows the company to obtain debtor in possession (DIP) financing.
</div>
<div class="item1">4.<span class="bold"> Chapter 7 Filing:</span> Enter into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing that liquidates the company, with the proceeds usually going primarily or exclusively to debt holders and other creditors.
</div>

</div>

<p class="para">Determining the best course of action necessarily will reflect a careful comparison of the pros and cons of the alternatives. The CFO typically will partner with the financial and legal advisors in this analysis, and with their advice, will take preparatory actions to preserve value and maximize the company's flexibility.</p>
