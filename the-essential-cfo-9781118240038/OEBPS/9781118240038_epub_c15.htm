<p class="chaptertitle">Chapter Fifteen</p>
<p class="chaptertitle">Obtaining Long-Term Financing</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">ALTHOUGH IT IS BETTER TO HAVE too much than too little capital, this margin of safety comes with a price. Therefore, it is always a delicate balance between the desire to be well-capitalized versus the fear of being over-capitalized.</p>
<p class="para">In striking the right balance, CFOs will consider not only the amount of capital that should be raised, but also the variety of sources from which it can be obtained. Each funding alternative has its unique blend of advantages and disadvantages, which CFOs will factor into their capital structure equation.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c15-1">VENTURE CAPITAL</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For start-ups and young companies, financing traditionally has come from equity investors who are seeking significant upside in exchange for a material risk of loss. Depending on the stage of a company's development and the amount of capital required, these investors can range from “angels” (private individuals) to large venture capital firms (institutions).</p>
<p class="para">Venture capital is usually the most expensive funding and can be difficult to obtain in size; thus, venture capital financing normally is approached with the twin goals of minimizing the amount raised and delaying the funding until it is absolutely required. However, its availability is also the most uncertain, subject not only to the quality of business plans presented, but also to the conditions in the venture capital market, which can fluctuate materially.</p>
<p class="para">Venture capital is typically raised in stages, which allows the investors at each stage to have more information about the progress to date and the future prospects for the business. This usually results in a lower cost of capital (less dilutive) than the funding raised in the previous stages, but it is still likely to be materially dilutive to the founders and earlier investors.</p>
<p class="para">In addition to providing funding, venture capital investors can usually offer their management skills and wealth of experience to a fledgling business, often serving on the company's board of directors. They can also be a good sounding board for decisions related to the future of the business—such as whether projects should be abandoned, expanded, or deferred.</p>
<p class="h2">Corporate Venture Funds</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As an alternative to the venture capital firms—which typically are funded by pension funds and other institutional investors—some corporations have established venture capital arms that are targeted at specific industries. The sponsors of these corporate funds are usually seeking advantages in addition to the financial returns—such as windows into new technologies, as well as opportunities for commercial or strategic relationships.</p>
<p class="para">Consequently, if CFOs consider financing from this source, they should clarify the fund's expectations and recognize that the ongoing relationship may complicate the company's potential strategies in the future. For example, it could constrain the company's flexibility to enter certain business lines; to launch an initial public offering; or to sell itself to an alternative corporate acquirer.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c15-2">PRIVATE EQUITY</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For more established companies, private equity firms can provide additional capital in the form of common stock, convertible preferred, or mezzanine debt. Private equity financing is generally less expensive than funding from venture capital sources and much greater amounts of capital are available from private equity sources in comparison with the venture capital markets. However, the hurdles for obtaining it are higher—usually requiring a track record of performance and growth. It's also higher cost financing than public market equity.</p>
<p class="para">In general, funding from a private equity firm can be a very attractive alternative for a private company that has moved beyond the venture capital stage, but is not yet ready to go public. Also, private companies can benefit from the managerial skills of private equity investors, whose expertise can help them to expand their business, institute management processes, and prepare for an eventual public offering.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, they often can help companies obtain debt financing, perhaps tapping the markets for syndicated bank loans or high yield debt. Moreover, in some cases the private equity firms can provide subordinated debt financing directly from funds that they have raised for this purpose.</p>
<p class="para">Private equity firms also provide capital to public companies through private investments in public equities (PIPEs). This product provides additional equity capital at a premium rate of return—typically a discount of 10 to 20 percent from the market price—in exchange for a stable source of long-term funds and a relationship with a savvy institutional investor whose imprimatur can provide comfort concerning the company's financial condition and business strategies.</p>
<p class="para">PIPEs are especially well-suited for relatively small capitalization companies that need additional equity funding to support their growth strategies. The biggest disadvantages are the dilution to existing shareholders and any contractual commitments that may constrain a CFO's financing flexibility in certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="h2">Sovereign Wealth Funds</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">It is estimated that sovereign wealth funds had $4.2 trillion of assets at the end of 2010 (up 11 percent from the end of 2009) and that another $6.8 trillion of assets were held in other sovereign investment vehicles, such as pension reserve funds and development funds.<a id="c15-not-0001-1" href="#c15-not-0001"><span class="superscript">1</span></a> Given expectations that these sovereign wealth funds will continue to grow in size and influence, and in light of their stated intentions to expand their private equity portfolios, they may represent an attractive source of funding in the future—including minority or majority equity stakes in developed country companies and private equity investments in emerging market companies.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c15-3">INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">When companies have achieved a certain size and maturity, they can consider an initial public offering (IPO). This is a seminal step in the life of a company, which is usually prompted by investors' desire to obtain liquidity, the need for additional capital to expand the business, or by constraints concerning the maximum number of shareholders without being subject to SEC disclosure requirements (generally a maximum of 500).</p>
<p class="h2">Underwriters</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In going public, the CFO usually will interview potential underwriters (a “bake-off” or “beauty contest”) and then select one or a few lead managers to orchestrate the process, which in the United States is subject to the Securities Act of 1933, as well as the requirements of the exchange on which the shares are to be listed. The underwriting fee (“spread”) will be negotiated as well, although most CFOs of smaller and less well-known companies will have little say concerning the amount paid to the investment bankers, who usually will quote a standard fee of 7 percent for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States.</p>
<p class="h2">Exchange Listing</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The CFO will also lead a process for choosing the exchange on which the shares will be listed. The majority of trading now occurs in third-party electronic markets; thus, the choice among exchanges will largely reflect a comparison of their fees, brand image, and services. Also, their listing requirements differ, which may be a consideration in some instances, as well as the governance rules that apply to their listed companies.</p>
<p class="h2">Deal Dynamics</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In consultation with the company, the underwriters will determine the number of shares to be issued, the range of potential prices for the shares, and the number of shares that are to be sold by the company (“primary” shares) versus the shares, if any, that are to be sold by existing shareholders (“secondary” shares). The underwriters and their counsel will also work with the company in preparing the disclosure documents, as well as the marketing materials that will be used in connection with a “road show” for investors. These are time-consuming processes that give the management team its first taste of life as a public company.</p>
<p class="para">The underwriters will also help the company to determine if and when the offering should proceed, because the investor appetite and market pricing for IPO shares can be notoriously fickle—with an IPO “window” that can shut precipitously for an unpredictable duration.</p>
<p class="para">In launching the offering, the underwriters will seek to have an oversubscribed offering—exercising the “<span class="italic">green shoe</span>” option to issue up to 15 percent more shares—and to see the shares trade at a premium from their initial offering price. The traditional guidepost is that the shares should trade at a  15 percent premium, but the actual results can deviate wildly from this target, especially for high-technology companies that are perceived as “hot” issues in the market.</p>
<p class="h2">Reverse Mergers</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As an alternative to a conventional IPO, a private company can execute a reverse merger whereby it combines with an existing public company (which typically is a shell company with little or no capitalization). The private company's shareholders will end up owning the large majority of the shares and controlling the board of directors of the combined company.</p>
<p class="para">The advantages of a reverse merger include the savings of time and money from avoiding the SEC registration process and the payment of underwriting fees. However, a comprehensive disclosure document must be filed with the SEC via a Form 8-K. Another advantage of a reverse merger is that it can reduce the amount of dilution to existing shareholders because new shares are not sold to the public at the time of the merger.</p>
<p class="para">The primary disadvantage of reverse mergers is that they are considered suspect by many investors due to their limited disclosure, their lack of a marketing period, and their limited liquidity. In June 2011 the SEC issued a statement that warned investors about the possibility for fraud or other abuses in connection with reverse mergers. In addition, CFOs should be aware of potentially assuming liabilities through the merger with the shell company.</p>
<p class="h2">Special Purpose Acquisition Companies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another alternative is to go public through a merger or sale to a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). A SPAC raises equity through an underwritten offering in the public markets for the purpose of acquiring private businesses. SPACs are essentially shell companies that usually have relatively free range (a “blank check”) concerning their investments in targeted industries.</p>
<p class="para">Although a number of SPACs were established in the United States during the past decade, they have not enjoyed a solid track record of success. Many have dissolved without completing a transaction (they have a two-year window to complete a merger or acquisition before being forced to dissolve). It is unclear whether they will be viable alternatives for private companies in the future and, in any event, only well-received transactions are likely to receive the requisite approval from a SPAC's shareholders.</p>
<p class="para">In recent years, SPACs have been established outside the United States, including in Europe and China. Therefore, they may become a more popular alternative in the future, especially in markets where the availability of equity financing is limited.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c15-4">SUBSEQUENT EQUITY OFFERINGS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">After going public, companies and their major shareholders have a number of alternatives for raising additional equity. These alternatives include secondary offerings, follow-on offerings, at-the-market issuances, and rights offerings.</p>
<p class="h2">Secondary Offerings</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In executing an IPO, the underwriters will generally require the company's management team and major shareholders to agree not to sell their shares for a period of time (the “<span class="italic">lock-up</span>”)—usually 180 days. When this time period expires, the shareholders can sell their shares in the market, often through a registered public offering. These secondary offerings are subject to the same kind of market judgments that go into the timing for IPOs, plus they have the added complication that insiders are selling their shares, which may arouse some concerns among potential investors.</p>
<p class="para">Generally, secondary offerings are better received when the sellers are professional investors such as venture capital or private equity firms than when the founders or members of management are reducing their ownership stake. The stock market generally wants the management team to be fully committed to the company and to maintain substantial “skin in the game.”</p>
<p class="h2">Follow-On Offerings</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">After a company has gone public, it can sell additional primary shares through follow-on offerings, although the timing is subject to the same kinds of lock-up restrictions that apply to secondary sales. Unlike a secondary offering, a follow-on offering raises equity that is retained by the company, with the proceeds typically used to repay debt or to fund an expansion of a company's  business—thus reinforcing the company's growth story and justifying the dilution of existing shareholders.</p>
<p class="para">Follow-on issuances are usually achieved through an underwritten distribution in which investment banks orchestrate the offering of shares during a defined marketing period, including investor presentations and perhaps a road show. However, depending on investor demand, they can also be accomplished quickly with a very limited marketing effort.</p>
<p class="h2">At-the-Market Offerings</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As an alternative to underwritten offerings, CFOs can issue additional shares in the open market through an “at-the-market” (ATM) offering. This technique is generally limited to companies that are fairly well-established and that have substantial liquidity in their stock.</p>
<p class="para">In an ATM offering (also called a “dribble out”) the issuer announces a target amount to be raised and files a registration statement with the SEC that allows the shares to be sold each day, provided that the company is not subject to a “black out” period and otherwise does not possess material information not disclosed to the public.</p>
<p class="para">The company typically engages an investment bank that acts as its agent in selling the shares into the market, usually based on instructions from the company each day to issue a targeted amount of the volume of trades that day. The shares can be sold through electronic markets that aggregate buying and selling activity or through blocks of stock that are sold directly to institutions. The objective is to sell the shares without materially impacting the average price at which the shares trade.</p>
<p class="h2">Rights Offerings</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another alternative for raising additional equity is a rights offering. Although relatively rare in the United States, rights offerings are frequently used in non-U.S. markets and are often preferred or even required by the non-U.S. regulatory authorities.</p>
<p class="para">In a rights offering, shareholders are issued warrants to buy additional shares at a fixed price that represents a discount from the market price prior to the offering. The shareholders then can choose either to sell the warrants to other investors or else to exercise the warrants for additional shares, presumably profiting from the discounted price.</p>
<p class="para">The biggest advantage of a rights offering is that existing shareholders are not diluted, which can be an especially important consideration if the size of the issuance is large compared with the existing market capitalization. In addition, a rights offering can be advantageous in accomplishing a financing when a company is undergoing financial difficulties or if market conditions are unfavorable.</p>
<p class="para">The principal arguments against rights offerings are that they can be disruptive to the market for the company's stock, and the company may receive less favorable pricing than through an underwritten offering that is marketed to new investors.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c15-5">TERM LOANS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Term loans are the work horses of the credit markets, providing funding for companies of various sizes for manifold purposes. The maturities usually range from one to 10 years and can either be secured or unsecured, depending on the quality of the credit and the use of proceeds. The interest rate usually floats over LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) at either a fixed spread or one that varies based on the borrower's current credit ratings. Banks are the primary sources of term loans, but commercial finance companies can offer them as well, often to finance real estate or equipment purchases.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c15-6">SYNDICATED BANK LOANS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In a syndicated bank loan, an arranger (usually a relationship bank of the borrower) negotiates a bank term loan that then is syndicated among other banks and financial institutions, such as special financing vehicles that hold collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These financings are especially common for leveraged buyouts, often in conjunction with issuances of high yield debt securities. Syndicated bank loans can be traded privately among the banks and institutional investors and are not subject to SEC registration requirements.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c15-7">INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Large, SEC-registered companies with investment grade debt ratings have considerable flexibility in arranging long-term debt financings in the public markets. Generally, they can enter the debt market quickly, typically obtaining their targeted amounts within a single day. Also, underwriters will compete to issue the debt, giving issuers the opportunity to compare proposals from a small group of banks. The underwriters typically will compete on the basis of their relationship with the issuer; the advisory services that they have provided concerning the proposed offering or other matters; and the proposed all-in interest rate for the debt, reflecting both the coupon and the underwriting commission.</p>
<p class="para">The pricing on the debt reflects a fixed interest rate that is based on a spread over Treasuries—reflecting the market's assessment of the credit quality of the issue in comparison with other securities in the market. While this assessment may be partially influenced by the issuer's debt ratings, the participants in the debt market will independently determine their own credit judgments; it's not uncommon for the debt pricing to deviate considerably between two issuers with identical debt ratings.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c15-8">HIGH YIELD SECURITIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For non-investment grade issuers, the high yield market can be a fertile source of larger long-term debt financings. This market can be tapped by public companies, but also by private companies that register their debt with the SEC and comply with the ongoing disclosure requirements. The offering is made initially to “qualified institutional buyers” under Rule 144a and then the issuer has a year to file the securities with the SEC.</p>
<p class="para">High yield debt has a lower cost of capital than equity alternatives—especially if the issuer can use the tax deduction for interest payments. Also, the offering does not dilute the existing shareholders—which can be an especially important consideration in closely held companies where the founders desire to maintain a controlling interest. Moreover, the issuer often has the option to pay in kind, which can make it a better substitute for equity than other fixed income alternatives. Finally, high yield financing can be arranged in large size over a wide spectrum of potential maturities, making it an especially flexible vehicle for implementing the CFO's capital structure strategies.</p>
<p class="para">However, the high yield markets are not always receptive to lower rated speculative credits and the spread required above Treasuries can vary considerably, depending upon the market's assessment of the economic outlook and the perceived risk of default on the debt. In addition, the interest payments are subject to Internal Revenue Service restrictions concerning the level of interest rates that are tax deductible.</p>
<p class="para">While high yield debt offers significant cost and other advantages compared with other long-term funding alternatives, CFOs should recognize that the relatively high interest expense can be a drain on cash—possibly exposing the company to a risk of default or even bankruptcy. Therefore, they will want to be confident that the company can comfortably service its debt obligations and comply with the debt covenants, especially if they have other financing options.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c15-9">STRATEGIC ALLIANCES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In some cases, CFOs may want to consider funding from a company that wants to establish a strategic alliance. This funding normally is in the form of common stock (usually less than 20 percent of shares outstanding) but convertible or preferred stock alternatives also can be negotiated. Strategic alliances can be found in almost any industry, but are more typically associated with technology, pharmaceutical, media, and financial services companies.</p>
<p class="h2">Motivations</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Providing funding through a strategic alliance can be motivated by a number of considerations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>To obtain insights and knowhow concerning a technology or business model.</li><li>To facilitate commercial arrangements such as research or marketing partnerships.</li><li>To gain an inside track for acquiring or distributing a company's products.</li><li>To establish a preferred position with respect to the potential acquisition of the company.</li></ul>

<p class="para">From the issuer's perspective, the terms can represent attractive financing in comparison with other alternatives and may permit long-term funding to be obtained in size during difficult market conditions—when alternative financing sources may be unavailable. Morgan Stanley's ability to obtain equity financing from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial during the financial crisis is a case in point.</p>
<p class="h2">Considerations</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">However, depending on the motivations of the strategic investor and the strings attached to the alliance, this financing alternative can reduce the issuer's flexibility in the marketplace. Furthermore, the exit strategy for the alliance can be problematic; the strategic partner may desire to achieve future liquidity for its investment, perhaps requiring the issuer to repurchase the securities or compelling an initial public offering. These exit arrangements can result in financing difficulties for the company and may cause disputes to arise concerning the valuation of the securities.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, the strategic partner may desire a preferred position in the event of the sale of the company, possibly through a right of first refusal or an option to match a third-party price. This can limit the company's flexibility and perhaps dissuade other potential acquirers from pursuing a transaction.</p>
<p class="para">Given the potential complications, if CFOs pursue a strategic alliance, they will want to understand their partner's motivations and objectives and to make the appropriate tradeoffs between negotiating the most attractive financing terms versus preserving their financial and strategic options.</p>
<p class="para">Moreover, they should work closely with their general counsel and external advisors in crafting financing terms that anticipate the various contingencies that may surface in the future. They should recognize that strategic alliances usually have a finite life, with five to seven years being a reasonable assumption for the typical life expectancy.</p>
