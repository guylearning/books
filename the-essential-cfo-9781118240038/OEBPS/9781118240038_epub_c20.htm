<p class="chaptertitle">Communicating  Financial Results</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">FOR ALMOST ALL PUBLIC COMPANIES, the announcement of their quarterly and annual results is punctuated by a web-based conference call that permits the management team to highlight the key items from the financial statements, update investors concerning their accomplishments and challenges, comment on their future plans and business outlook, and entertain questions from analysts and investors.</p>
<p class="para">Private companies likewise have developed routines for communicating their results, but it is harder to generalize with respect to the specific steps that are followed. Nonetheless, it is undoubtedly true that like their public company counterparts, private company CFOs typically view the quarterly and annual results as important junctures that require some effort to put the results in context and to provide the color that helps investors to understand them as clearly as possible.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c20-1">EARNINGS CALL</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In anticipation of announcing their results, CFOs will usually lead a process that begins a few weeks earlier and culminates with the conference call and follow-ups with analysts. The process generally follows a similar routine in most companies, although CFOs will adapt the routine for their particular facts and circumstances.</p>
<p class="h2">Identify Message Points</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The process typically begins with the identification of the issues that will be on investor minds and the key points to address in communicating the financial results. Based on the forecasted results, CFOs will have a good idea of the way that the numbers are likely to finish and this allows them to get a leg up on the preparations.</p>
<p class="para">Much like a politician preparing for a press conference, the financial and communication teams try to predetermine the key points to be emphasized each quarter. This includes focusing on the accomplishments during the quarter and the progress being made against the company's strategic objectives, as well as anticipating the issues and questions that will need to be addressed.</p>
<p class="para">In particular, CFOs will try to identify any areas in the financial results that may come as a surprise to investors.</p>
<p class="h2">Prepare Draft Materials</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The team will prepare a draft press release, which generally should follow a similar format from quarter to quarter, but should also include key message points, where appropriate. The press release forms the foundation for all of the company's communications, and thus it is helpful to get an early start on this document, even if there are holes to be filled in later.</p>
<p class="para">Most companies use quotes from the CEO to communicate any information that involves subjective interpretations or expectations for the future. Otherwise, the press release should be based totally on objective facts.</p>
<p class="h2">Assign Potential Questions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Starting with the questions and answers from the previous quarter, CFOs will solicit potential questions that might arise during the earnings call and determine which of the questions from the prior quarter are no longer applicable. They will then assign the questions to various people throughout the company, asking them to update the previous answers and to prepare draft answers to the new questions that have been identified.</p>
<p class="para">The practice of preparing draft answers in written form is a useful discipline—although the intent is not to read them. Instead, management uses the written answers as background for developing the extemporaneous responses that they will provide on the call. In some cases, however, the answers will be incorporated into the press release or prepared remarks, thus preempting likely questions.</p>
<p class="h2">Prepare Draft Scripts</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The earnings call typically begins with prepared remarks in which the CEO provides general commentary about the quarter and the future outlook and the CFO provides a review of the financial statements. However, for some companies—especially very large companies with diversified businesses—the CFO will deliver most or all of the prepared remarks. In another variation, companies with chief operating officers will usually give them a prominent role in communicating the business results.</p>
<p class="para">The prepared remarks will be transcribed verbatim by third-party services and made available to investors through the Internet. Thus, the scripts offer an invaluable opportunity for companies to highlight their key message points, provide context for their financial results, and identify the specific factors that affected the company's results during the quarter. It is also a chance to explain any technical accounting or one-time events that may not be easily discernible from the press release.</p>
<p class="para">The scripts typically go through several drafts and are carefully reviewed by legal counsel and external auditors.</p>
<p class="h2">Review Draft Materials</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The next step is to review the draft press release, the draft scripts, and the draft questions and answers. In addition to the CEO and CFO, the group that conducts this review typically includes members of the financial, communications, and legal teams, as well as representatives from the business units, often the business leaders. Their goal is to make sure that all of the facts are correct and that everyone is comfortable with the way that the quarter is described to investors.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, the process of reviewing the draft materials invariably will reveal topics that need further elaboration and potential questions that should be added to the list. Furthermore, the group will consider any areas where the actual financial results are deviating from the forecast.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, they will discuss the likely reactions from investors, comparing the company's results against investor expectations, and considering any earnings announcements that have been made to date by competitors.</p>
<p class="h2">Obtain Sign-Offs</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The press release and scripts typically will be reviewed by various business unit and corporate staff leaders. In addition, the company will need to receive sign offs from the external auditors and the general counsel, who often will have the materials reviewed by an external lawyer who specializes in securities law.</p>
<p class="para">The press release must also be formally approved by the audit committee of the board of directors. Because the audit committee includes people with financial expertise, they can serve as a sounding board, not only for the contents of the press release, but also concerning the proposed message points that will be delivered through the scripts and in the answers to likely questions. They can also suggest areas where the communications may need to be clarified or augmented.</p>
<p class="h2">Prepare Webcast Slides</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A minority of companies prepare slides to accompany the webcast of their earnings call. The CFOs who take this approach generally argue that the visuals help them to communicate clearly with investors. However, many investors will be participating by phone and not over the web. Furthermore, using slides necessarily involves extra layers of review—especially by legal and compliance professionals—which may require that extra time be built into the timeline in preparing for the call.</p>
<p class="para">If CFOs include slides, they should take steps to expedite their preparation. For example, the slides typically will follow a fairly standardized format, with relatively consistent information that is presented from quarter to quarter.</p>
<p class="h2">Rehearse the Call</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The presenters should rehearse their prepared remarks, identifying any sentences or words that look good on paper, but which do not work as well when communicated orally. For example, the scripts normally should not use contractions and should avoid parenthetical phrases or complex sentence structures.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, it is very helpful to review the draft answers to potential questions, with the goals of identifying who will answer each of the questions, converting the draft answers into extemporaneous responses, and maintaining the flexibility to adjust the answers to the various ways in which a question may be asked.</p>
<p class="h2">Contact People in Advance</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In advance of the earnings call, CFOs typically will determine who should receive a “heads up” concerning the results.</p>
<p class="para">Many companies provide an “embargoed” advance copy of the press release to selected news services—such as Bloomberg, Dow Jones, or Reuters—and offer to conduct a brief interview in advance of the call. Since the news services are working on tight deadlines, this gives them an opportunity to clarify any open questions and to obtain some commentary—usually from the CEO or CFO—to supplement the release. This is a fairly common practice and generally safe, although there have been rare occurrences where a draft release has been distributed prematurely, creating havoc for all involved.</p>
<p class="para">Especially if the company's debt ratings are on the watch list for a potential downgrade or upgrade, or if the earnings announcement contains significant new information concerning the company's financial condition, CFOs will often provide an advance copy of the press release to the rating agencies and hold a brief call to answer their questions. This can avoid surprise reactions from them and helps to cultivate a constructive dialogue with the ratings team.</p>
<p class="para">Other examples of people whom CFOs might want to contact in advance include financial advisors, regulators, major customers, or important suppliers. However, they should be careful to avoid any potential misuses of the insider information.</p>
<p class="h2">Conduct the Call</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The conference calls typically last about an hour and are normally scheduled before the market opens in the morning or after the market closes in the afternoon. The participants are usually in “listen only” mode for the prepared remarks and then the lines are opened, enabling them to ask questions according to a queue that is managed by a moderator.</p>
<p class="para">The questions are normally dominated by sell side equity analysts, although the company may get questions from major shareholders or debt holders, especially if the company has a transaction pending. Representatives of the media should not ask questions on the call and, if possible, they should be screened from entering the queue.</p>
<p class="para">Companies often have additional management people in addition to the CEO, COO, and CFO—such as business unit heads and the general counsel—available to answer questions. This can help provide detailed responses, but requires more dexterity in orchestrating the call.</p>
<p class="para">Employees can normally participate through the webcast. In addition, companies will often schedule a follow-up call with management, who can then cascade key message points to their organizations.</p>
<p class="h2">Follow-Ups</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Subsequent to the call, the company's investor relations and financial people will usually make themselves available to the equity analysts to clarify the information and answers that were provided during the call—but they are careful not to provide any new information that could be deemed a violation of the Fair Disclosure regulation (which prohibits selective disclosure of material information). In most cases, the analysts will be updating their earnings models and confirming the points that they heard on the call.</p>
<p class="para">The sell side analysts will typically issue a report to investors within 24 hours of the call. In addition to highlighting the information provided by the company, the analysts will summarize their impressions and note any updates to their earnings forecasts or target stock prices.</p>
<p class="para">The call is recorded and posted as soon as practicable on the company's website, where it can be accessed by investors, employees, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c20-2">NON-GAAP MEASURES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decreed that generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) should be the primary methodology for communicating financial results—including in press releases and investor presentations. Nevertheless, many CFOs have advocated the use of non-GAAP measures as supplementary information, with reconciliations to their GAAP results.</p>
<p class="para">They argue that non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors, especially if these alternative metrics are in fact used by the company in managing its business and by analysts when comparing companies in their industry. The SEC has generally acquiesced to this practice—provided that GAAP information is presented and that any non-GAAP information is fully reconciled to the GAAP results.</p>
<p class="h2">Adjusted Earnings</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A relatively common practice is to compute “adjusted” earnings that exclude certain expenses. For example, CFOs may choose to exclude restructuring expenses, legal settlements, and gains or losses on divestitures. Other examples of potentially excluded items are amortization expenses that arise from intangibles due to purchase accounting adjustments in acquisitions or non-cash write-offs of software due to obsolescence or a company's decision to consolidate on another technology platform. They may also exclude or provide breakdowns of the impacts due to fair value accounting, such as the changes to debt valuations pursuant to FAS 159.</p>
<p class="para">Providing adjusted earnings seems to be fairly well accepted by the financial markets, with many analysts using them in their earnings per share forecasts. However, CFOs need to be careful not to overdo the exclusions, thereby losing credibility. For example, while excluding episodic restructurings can be justified, analysts will look more askance at serial restructurings, which can be construed as a recurring cost of doing business. They should also apply the adjustments consistently from one quarter to the next.</p>
<p class="h2">Industry Norms</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The other common use of non-GAAP information is to provide measures that are typically used by analysts and investors in an industry. For example, CFOs of capital intensive businesses may present earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). As another example, frequent acquirers may emphasize earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles (EBITA).</p>
<p class="para">Although the financial markets generally appreciate this supplemental information, CFOs should be careful not to deviate too much from accepted norms. For example, Groupon's attempt to present a novel earnings measure in its original initial public offering (IPO) filing highlighted the risk of running afoul of accepted practices or SEC constraints. As a result, if CFOs are going to introduce a new non-GAAP measure, they will need to build in time for legal counsel to review the draft materials and to be cautious in defining measures that deviate too greatly from the conventional alternatives.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, analysts and investors can be naturally skeptical if it appears that a CFO is manipulating a company's presentation materials so as to “spin” the financial results and future outlook. For this reason, CFOs should use non-GAAP measures sparingly and should emphasize consistency in their investor communications—resisting the temptation to “cherry pick” the metrics that make the company look good.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c20-3">EARNINGS GUIDANCE</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another key issue that CFOs of public companies must address is whether to provide guidance concerning their expectations for future earnings. Investors—and especially sell side analysts—often profess their preference for such earnings guidance. Furthermore, it is often argued that providing guidance can add shareholder value by the additional information that is communicated to investors.</p>
<p class="para">However, a 2006 McKinsey study did not find this to be the case, reaching the following conclusion:</p>
<p class="quote">Our analysis of the perceived benefits of issuing frequent earnings guidance found no evidence that it affects valuation multiples, improves shareholder returns, or reduces share price volatility.<a id="c20-not-0001-1" href="#c20-not-0001"><span class="superscript">1</span></a></p>
<p class="para">Given the countervailing views, there is no strong consensus among CFOs on whether to provide earnings guidance and, if so, what form it should take. And while there definitely has been a reduction in the number of companies providing guidance—especially in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis—CFOs continue to take varying approaches to their guidance practices.</p>
<p class="para">The primary alternatives are to provide both quarterly and annual earnings guidance, to provide annual earnings guidance only, or to provide no earnings guidance at all.</p>
<p class="h2">Quarterly and Annual Guidance</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The most expansive approach is to provide guidance for the upcoming quarter and the full year. This was the prevailing practice in the past, but it has become less common in today's market environment, especially given the volatility and uncertainties introduced by the financial crisis and economic recession.</p>
<p class="para">The principal argument for this approach is that it helps to avoid volatile reactions in the stock price if earnings fail to meet analysts' expectations. By providing guidance, management can share its best thinking about the outlook and lessen the probability that the analysts will develop unrealistic expectations. It also makes it easier for CFOs to have conversations with analysts and investors about the company's outlook without violating the Fair Disclosure constraints.</p>
<p class="para">However, providing this guidance can be problematic. First, management exposes itself to the risk of unintentionally misleading investors, especially if much of the revenue and net income drivers in any quarter are outside the company's control. In fact, providing guidance that turns out to be wrong can exacerbate rather than ameliorate the stock's reaction to disappointing results. It also can cause management—especially the CFO—to lose precious credibility with investors.</p>
<p class="para">Second, if it becomes apparent that the company is likely either to exceed or to miss its guidance, the question arises as to whether the company should pre-announce its earnings (by issuing a press release during the quarter to update the market concerning its revised earnings expectations). In contrast, if it has not provided guidance, the company is under less legal and market pressure to make a special disclosure in advance of the earnings announcement.</p>
<p class="para">Third, it can increase the company's vulnerability to shareholder lawsuits. With the benefit of hindsight, the likelihood of an earnings miss can appear to have been obvious and lawyers can often find public comments by management that can seem to be incriminating after the fact.</p>
<p class="para">And fourth, investors may become skeptical if the company has a propensity to provide “lowball” estimates that it almost always exceeds. This in turn can produce “<span class="italic">whisper</span>” numbers in the market, making it confusing to discern whether the company has in fact met or exceeded the market's  expectations.</p>
<p class="h2">Annual Guidance Only</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given the disadvantages with regularly providing guidance, some CFOs choose to take a middle ground: providing annual guidance only, typically estimating a range of expected results for revenue and earnings per share. This eliminates some of the company's exposure to quarter-to-quarter volatility in the results (e.g., if software sales are deferred into the next quarter) and generally reduces the company's vulnerability to unforeseen events.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs who take this approach typically provide the annual guidance at the beginning of the fiscal year—when their budgets have been completed—and either reaffirm or update their range of expected outcomes at each earnings call. Therefore, as the year progresses, their guidance gradually becomes more precise, with fewer periods in which to make up shortfalls or to fall further behind. Furthermore, CFOs taking this approach often define their guidance to exclude certain items—focusing on “adjusted” rather than GAAP earnings—which reduces their vulnerability to wide swings in the estimates.</p>
<p class="para">Providing annual guidance generally represents a compromise between the desire to guide investor expectations versus the risk that the guidance can be misleading over the short term. It is consistent with the goal of providing greater transparency to investors, but it still exposes the company to legal risks and potential loss of management credibility.</p>
<p class="h2">No Guidance at All</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The final alternative is to provide no guidance whatsoever. This has been the growing trend, especially among companies in economically sensitive industries or whose mark-to-market accounting can significantly affect their results.</p>
<p class="para">During the financial crisis, many companies suspended their guidance due to the extreme uncertainty in the economy and have not resumed the practice. Moreover, some analysts and investors who previously applauded the policy of providing quarterly guidance have become accustomed to a world without guidance and are less adamant in their belief that it is advantageous for investors.</p>
<p class="h2">Earnings Drivers</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Whatever their policy with respect to providing formal earnings guidance, CFOs generally are providing more information concerning the variables that drive their results. By providing additional information about the company's earnings drivers, CFOs can assist analysts in deriving forecasts and can reinforce their reputation for transparency.</p>
<p class="para">For example, CFOs can explain their company's exposure to foreign exchange or interest rates and quantify their sensitivity to hypothetical percentage movements. Likewise, they can provide more information concerning the exogenous and company-specific factors that drive revenue (such as sensitivity to pricing for products or services), their programs to lower the cost base (such as expected trend lines in major cost drivers), and the potential impact from material accounting assumptions (such as the pension fund discount rate or the depreciation schedules for major assets).</p>
<p class="para">In taking this approach, CFOs should also use their earnings calls to update investors concerning any unusual factors that will be affecting the results in the upcoming quarter or year. For example, they may indicate an expected gain on an asset sale or highlight an exposure due to a legal settlement.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, they can provide guidance concerning parts of the income statement that are especially unpredictable. For example, tax rates are notoriously volatile given the requirement to update the expected effective tax rate each quarter; for clarity, the CFO can inform investors on the call what the expected tax rate will be for the next quarter or the full year.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should be similarly transparent concerning the key performance metrics that will drive future revenue and earnings. For example, they can update investors concerning the number of customers, the company's headcount trends, or the anticipated spending on advertising. Investors will appreciate knowing the metrics that the CFO thinks are important, as well as the company's current performance against those metrics.</p>
