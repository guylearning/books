<p class="chaptertitle">Chapter Twenty-Four</p>
<p class="chaptertitle">Developing Financial Talent</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs UNIVERSALLY BELIEVE THAT developing financial talent is one of their highest priorities and confirm that they are spending more time than ever in hiring, retaining, and training the finance professionals in their organizations. However, it is a priority that can be especially challenging in the current environment</p>
<p class="para">First, the focus on reducing headcount has led to financial organizations that are more risk averse to transfer people to unfamiliar areas or to expand their responsibilities too quickly. It is simply less risky to keep good people safely ensconced in their comfort zones.</p>
<p class="para">Second, the greater specialization that comes with finance transformation can make it harder to develop well-rounded finance professionals. Unless proactive steps are initiated, high-potential people may spend the preponderance of their careers in a particular functional track, such as controllership, financial planning and analysis (FP&amp;A), audit, or treasury functions.</p>
<p class="para">Third, there are fewer entry-level positions due to the automation of routine activities; the greater use of outsourcing; and the heightened emphasis on analytical skills, which usually require a higher threshold of prior business experience.</p>
<p class="para">Fourth, given the competitive marketplace for talent among a mobile work force, finance professionals may be reluctant to accept a lateral transfer to a new area, preferring to accept an offer from another company in their current area of expertise—usually involving an increase in responsibility, a loftier title, and additional pay.</p>
<p class="para">In the face of these challenges, CFOs are devoting more of their personal time to recruiting and developing their people. In particular, they are playing a highly visible role in implementing talent development programs throughout their financial organizations and encouraging their managers to take risks for the benefit of the organization's future talent needs.</p>
<p class="para">This effort can produce an exceptionally high return on investment and can be one of the most personally fulfilling aspects of the CFO's job.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c24-1">RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Without exception, CFOs will proclaim the importance of having quality people in their financial organization, and they unanimously will agree that hiring highly skilled talent is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for executing their playbook. Unless they can recruit people who have the requisite skill set—including the potential for continuous learning and advancement—no amount of development effort is likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, while there may be universal agreement concerning the “ends” of a recruiting program, there are considerable differences in viewpoints concerning the “means.” To a very large extent, these differences in approach will reflect differences in philosophies, traditions, and cultures, as well as the CFO's specific priorities and needs at the time.</p>
<p class="h2">Entry Level or Lateral Hires</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In virtually all cases, a company's financial organization will comprise a mix of people who were hired for an entry-level job versus those that joined after prior experience elsewhere. However, companies can differ markedly in the extent to which they emphasize either approach.</p>
<p class="para">The advantage of entry-level hires is that these home-grown professionals can become steeped in the company's business and culture. Moreover, they can gain valuable insights and perspectives from starting at a relatively low-level position within the financial organization—enabling them to be more effective and empathetic leaders later in their career.</p>
<p class="para">The advantage of lateral hires is that they can bring useful experience to the job, especially if they have gained technical skills and broad-based business exposure in their prior positions. For example, companies have had success in hiring accounting, FP&amp;A, and internal audit people from the major accounting firms, which deservedly are well renowned for their training programs. As another example, companies can staff their treasury and corporate development groups with well-qualified lateral hires from investment and commercial banks or consulting firms.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, many of the laterals are hired from other financial organizations, which is a practice that coincides with the growing proclivity for young professionals to make frequent job changes. CFOs should incorporate this infusion of talent into their career development programs, making sure that they have robust on-boarding procedures and ways of fully integrating the newcomers into their organization.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, they will want to ensure that these lateral hires do not become range bound in their technical specialties for too long and that they are provided opportunities to play broader and higher-level leadership roles.</p>
<p class="h2">Hiring of MBAs</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Although few companies require an MBA for advancement to a leadership role in their financial organizations, some CFOs actively recruit MBAs directly from business schools—as a way to strengthen their financial talent base and to import analytical and strategic skills.</p>
<p class="para">The advantage of this hiring strategy is that the people have a proven track record from their prior business experience, and they likely will have benefited from the education and broadening provided by the business schools. It is also a particularly good way to recruit non-U.S. talent who can help to define and execute a company's global strategies.</p>
<p class="para">However, while hiring MBAs undoubtedly can increase the pool of high- potential people in the financial organization, it can also create some management challenges.</p>
<p class="para">First, their higher salaries can cause budget issues for the department that is hiring them; this can be overcome by a subsidy from the CFO, but at the risk of fairness issues if two people in the financial organization are receiving different pay for performing the same or a similar job.</p>
<p class="para">Second, to recruit MBAs, companies often need to offer a distinctive early career track—such as a rotational program during the first few years—which can create conflicts with the non-MBA professionals, who may resent the unequal treatment.</p>
<p class="para">Third, they may have unrealistic expectations concerning their upward trajectory, with them often expecting to run a business at a relatively early stage in their career. If these expectations are unmet, they may become disgruntled and leave the company.</p>
<p class="para">This is definitely an area where a company's prior experience and culture can make a big difference. If a company has a track record of success in hiring MBAs, then the CFO is likely to enjoy success going forward. However, if a company has not recruited MBAs in the past, then there may be some growing pains if the CFO's plans are too ambitious; in this case, the CFO may want to take a more gradual and cautious approach, perhaps focusing initially on lateral hires of MBAs from banks or consulting firms.</p>
<p class="h2">Evaluations of Candidates</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Companies can use a variety of methods for identifying potential hires, ranging from postings on job sites and social media networks, to referrals from existing employees, to active on-campus recruiting programs at targeted schools, to engaging professional recruiting firms using either a dedicated or a contingency arrangement.</p>
<p class="para">By employing these various methods of recruiting, companies generally can obtain a good pool of candidates who meet the job requirements—at least as indicated by their resumes. The harder task is to determine whether the individual is a good fit with the company and whether he or she is likely to thrive in the environment over the long term (or at least for the next two to five years).</p>
<p class="para">Traditionally, companies have used serial interviews to evaluate candidates—focused primarily on the person's background, prior experience, and technical skills. This has usually worked well, but given the stakes of making a bad hire, some CFOs are now incorporating other techniques for assessing prospective employees.</p>
<p class="para">For example, they may ask the candidate to meet with a panel of interviewers for an in-depth discussion, thus creating constructive dynamics from having several perspectives represented in the questions asked of the candidate. Each member of the panel benefits from the answers elicited by the other panel members.</p>
<p class="para">As other examples, CFOs may request writing samples from the candidates or may ask them to discuss a business case provided to them in advance. And, of course, there is the stress interview that focuses on an intellectually challenging question.</p>
<p class="para">Whatever the method used, it definitely makes sense to learn more about the candidate than can be gleaned from the resume, with the overarching goal of determining not only whether the person can do the job, but whether he or she will be happy doing it. References can help in some instances, but their candor is often constrained by legal considerations or their desire to be helpful to the candidate's prospects.</p>
<p class="para">The bottom line is that CFOs should seek to learn as much as possible, not only about the candidate's education and prior experience, but also about his or her motivations and definitions of success. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate the person's potential to progress beyond the current job—to broader and higher responsibilities within the financial organization—rather than focusing too much on the current position being filled.</p>
<p class="h2">Emphasis on Soft Skills</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another question is how much emphasis should be placed on evaluating the candidate's technical skills and relevant prior experience versus the “soft skills” that may not have much direct relevance for the current role, but that could be crucial for the individual's long-term advancement.</p>
<p class="para">What are these soft skills? While opinions can differ, one CFO has provided an especially cogent description of the attributes that he seeks in recruits—what he calls the four “Is.” In reverse order of importance, they include: <span class="italic">intellectual skills, intensity, interpersonal skills, and integrity.</span><a id="c24-not-0001-1" href="#c24-not-0001"><span class="superscript">1</span></a></p>
<p class="para">CFOs increasingly are emphasizing these soft skills, recognizing that when a new hire does not work out, it is usually not due to technical shortcomings, but more likely is due to intrinsic characteristics that make the individual a poor match for the organization. In addition, they are evaluating personal qualities—such as integrity—that are absolutely essential, irrespective of the position being filled.</p>
<p class="h2">Expatriates versus Locals</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In staffing their overseas operations, CFOs need to address their preference for relocating expatriates versus hiring local recruits. To a large degree, this preference may depend on the stage of development in their international operations and the availability of local talent who can satisfy the technical requirements.</p>
<p class="para">As a general trend, CFOs are relying less on expatriates and recruiting more local talent, especially as their operations become more global and less home-country centric. However, most CFOs of U.S. companies still strongly prefer, or may even require, that finance professionals speak English.</p>
<p class="para">When local talent is hired, it is usually desirable—if financially feasible—that they spend some time at the corporate or regional headquarters  early in their tenure. This orientation—which can be accomplished either through a formal training program or through a special visit—can make a real difference in their ability to work effectively with the rest of the financial organization.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c24-2">DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Assuming that CFOs have identified and hired well-qualified finance professionals, their next challenge is to develop this talent to its full potential.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs often develop checklists of the basic skills that their finance professionals should seek to master and identify the personal qualities that they want their people to exemplify—often relating these qualities to the brand attributes that they are seeking to instill throughout the financial organization. However, these checklists can be daunting—indicating a large number of skills and attributes that are deemed to be desirable—and may be misleading concerning the way that talent is actually evaluated for financial leadership positions.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, it can be helpful to emphasize the overarching objectives of the development program: expertise, experience, and leadership skills. All three are essential for advancement within the financial organization or in a broader management role.</p>
<p class="h2">Expertise</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The first objective is for finance professionals to demonstrate a high level of competence within their area of expertise. In most cases, this requires a minimum time commitment—probably two to four years—for finance professionals to master their current job duties and to add distinctive value. They should spend enough time in the position to achieve a high-quality work product and to achieve a superior level of performance, as evidenced by their annual performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="para">If a finance professional moves too quickly from job to job, he or she may not have the chance to master a set of skills and can become known as a “jack of all trades,” which generally has a pejorative connotation within the financial organization. Instead, it is incumbent on finance professionals to exhibit a commitment to their functional area. This includes focusing on technical skills and staying current on best practices.</p>
<p class="para">However, it is also important that they not become pigeonholed—too strongly identified with a particular area of expertise and not considered as a candidate for a different or broader role. Thus, finance professionals need to strike the right balance between demonstrating superior skills in their current area, while remaining open to new challenges outside their comfort zone.</p>
<p class="h2">Experience</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The second objective is for finance professionals to broaden their experience base through a series of positions and, if possible, a variety of situations. For example, it is generally desirable for finance professionals to balance a headquarters position with a position in the field or to take a position within another functional area in the financial organization.</p>
<p class="para">For example, a high-potential individual may go from an accounting role at headquarters to a similar role in a business unit location or else may take a job in another area such as treasury or investor relations. Of course, this objective can be constrained by circumstances that limit the person's ability to relocate. However, CFOs are often able to devise creative solutions to accommodate an individual's specific requirements.</p>
<p class="para">Given the increasing globalization of markets and supply chains, CFOs often want their finance professionals to gain experience outside their home country. Becoming exposed to international operations can help the individual gain a fuller appreciation for the company's scope of operations and a greater sensitivity with respect to the challenges of operating in locations with varying cultures and business practices.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs often emphasize the value to be gained through experience in business operations, typically through an FP&amp;A or a shared service position. This can prepare people for future roles within a business unit—perhaps in a general management role—as well as enhance their effectiveness within the financial organization. In fact, many companies consider business unit experience to be a prerequisite for the CFO position.</p>
<p class="para">Internal audit is generally considered a good vehicle for gaining exposure to business operations, especially in the case of audits that involve extended visits to a field location. Many companies have introduced programs whereby their finance people can participate in audits on a rotating basis, thereby giving them exposure to business operations without having to make an extended time commitment to an internal audit position. These are very worthwhile programs, and a particularly good experience for the people involved.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, finance professionals should seek to learn more about the company's business and financial strategies. In particular, they should familiarize themselves with the capital allocation and funding policies, the shareholder return objectives, and the enterprise risks, as well as the way that the company's strategies are communicated to investors.</p>
<p class="para">Understanding the broader business and financial strategies will help finance professionals to perform their current jobs and will provide evidence that they have the ambition and capabilities to assume greater responsibilities.</p>
<p class="h2">Leadership</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The third and most important objective is for finance professionals to develop their leadership skills. Most of these skills can be considered “soft” and thus can be more difficult to measure objectively in a formal development plan. Nevertheless, they probably represent the attributes that are most crucial in determining an individual's long-term career trajectory.</p>
<p class="para">What are these leadership skills? Certainly, they include <span class="italic">communications</span>: the ability to write succinctly, yet comprehensively, to make compelling presentations, to take complex topics and reduce them to their essence, to speak confidently and persuasively to both large and small groups, and to listen carefully. Ironically, in a world that is increasingly moving toward shorthand communications such as tweets and text messaging, the focus on traditional communication skills is more important than ever, and they offer one of the ways that young finance professionals can stand out among their peers.</p>
<p class="para">The required leadership skills also include the ability to <span class="italic">organize and motivate</span> groups, often where there are unclear reporting relationships and ambiguous scopes of responsibility. For this reason, CFOs often assign high-potential people to special task forces and project teams where they can gain experience in working within an unstructured environment. Most finance professionals are very good at working within well-defined parameters; however, to excel at higher levels within the financial organization, they will need to be equally comfortable with ambiguity—working with a clean sheet of paper on an unstructured task that has a “to be determined” definition of success.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, they should have <span class="italic">management capabilities</span> as well as leadership skills, not just with respect to their direct reports, but more important, with people outside their span of control—often outside the finance organization. The most successful managers pay attention to the details, but don't get bogged down. They know how to set realistic objectives, when to follow up, and when to intervene with a mid-course correction.</p>
<p class="para">They also know how to <span class="italic">manage upward,</span> recognizing that managing their boss is vital to their success and having a sixth sense as to when and how to bring problems to his or her attention. Moreover, they cultivate realistic expectations concerning the results to be achieved within a given time frame.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, leadership skills include the ability to transcend narrow, technical skills and to make meaningful contributions with respect to broader responsibilities, including the formulation and execution of value-enhancing <span class="italic">business and financial strategies.</span> Given the greater emphasis on partnering with the CEO and business leaders in delivering shareholder value, finance professionals will be expected to become more strategic in their thoughts and actions.</p>
<p class="h2">Continuous Learning</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In addition to a tripartite focus on expertise, experience, and leadership, CFOs should also emphasize the importance of continuous learning. This includes maintaining an intellectual curiosity about new developments, especially in a person's area of expertise, and being openly receptive to new ways of doing things.</p>
<p class="para">Continuous learning should also include business and financial history. Knowing the historical context—of economic cycles, market bubbles, ponzi schemes, accounting frauds, business booms and busts, inflation and interest rates, depressions and recessions, mergers and acquisitions, financial theories, and so forth—can provide invaluable perspectives for assessing current developments and making considered judgments.</p>
<p class="para">In other words, the old adage that “there is nothing new under the sun” applies to finance as well as to the rest of life. And knowing the historical track record can help financial leaders to respond effectively to the challenges of the present.</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>

<p class="h1" id="c24-3">DEVELOPMENT TOOLS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can use a variety of tools to advance their development programs, often in concert with human resource programs that are used throughout the company. However, even if participating in a company-wide program, CFOs should adapt the program to the particular needs of their financial organization and take a direct personal interest in its implementation.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs typically use a blend of proven strategies and best practices in their talent development programs, ranging from formal processes—such as development plans, talent assessments, and succession planning—to mentoring, recognition programs, and informal communications.</p>
<p class="h2">Development Plans</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Development plans are essential to the CFO's playbook and should be required for everyone in the financial organization.</p>
<p class="para">At least annually, all finance professionals should specify their development objectives and then discuss them with their managers. These plans can include technical skills to obtain, courses to take, or areas of self-improvement to emphasize. They should reinforce a commitment to continuous learning and foster greater self-awareness.</p>
<p class="para">They can also facilitate a productive dialogue between managers and their team members, providing a vehicle for an ongoing dialogue about each employee's career aspirations and development needs. This can make a difference in retaining high-potential people, who generally seek the individual attention that these plans can deliver.</p>
<p class="para">Although many companies use computerized templates for preparing the plans, they are just as effective—if not more so—if summarized in a single page of bullet points. If they are too elaborate or too bureaucratic, they can lose some of their impact—which should be squarely focused on the individual's needs and not on the form to be completed.</p>
<p class="para">It is a best practice to separate the discussion of the development plans from the individual's annual performance reviews. Although the two discussions are obviously related, they should serve different purposes and should not be combined.</p>
<p class="h2">Talent Assessments</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs often administer a program for assessing their talent each year—typically reviewing each of the finance professionals at a specified level and above (e.g., managers and above). Usually, these assessments use a three-by-three or two-by-two grid to measure professionals along two dimensions: (1) their performance in their current job and (2) their potential for higher levels within the organization.</p>
<p class="para">This bifurcation helps reinforce the distinction between the skills needed to perform today's job versus the skills needed for tomorrow's job, and highlights the difference between a performance review and a development plan. A sample format is shown in <a id="c24-fig-0001-1" href="#c24-fig-0001">Figure 24.1</a>.</p><div class="figure">
<p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c24-fig-0001" href="#c24-fig-0001-1">Figure 24.1</a></span> Talent Reviews</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/c24f001.jpg" alt="c24f001.eps" width="417" height="317"/>
</div>

<p class="para">The talent reviews are then shared among the senior management team to raise awareness of the talent base throughout the finance organization—including the identification of high potential individuals—and to ensure that there is a consensus concerning the evaluations. The group will also identify areas where developmental actions should be considered for individuals, including potential movements to another position that will broaden their experience.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs have differing views as to whether they should share the results of the talent assessments with the people being evaluated. On the one hand, it is good feedback for the people, who can benefit from learning the objective assessments, especially the appraisals of their long-term potential. It can help manage their expectations and perhaps indicate development actions that would be especially desirable.</p>
<p class="para">On the other hand, communicating the specific evaluations can imply more precision than is warranted and may be discouraging to an individual, especially in the early stages of his or her career. The danger is that the assessment can be self-fulfilling and perhaps can prematurely curtail a person's upward potential.</p>
<p class="para">In either event, it is important that the “process” for assessing talent be transparent, which should give everyone comfort that the financial leaders are focused on facilitating their career aspirations and meeting their long-term development needs. Furthermore, describing the process can reassure people that the financial organization is a meritocracy based on performance and skills—and not overly influenced by cronyism or personal exposure to the decision makers—which can be particularly important as financial organizations become more diverse.</p>
<p class="h2">Succession Plans</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For each position at a specified level and above (e.g., the director level and above) CFOs often will sponsor an annual exercise whereby candidates are identified who could fill each of the key financial leadership positions—either immediately, within the intermediate term (say, one to three years), or within a longer period (say, three to five years).</p>
<p class="para">These succession plans are then reviewed by the senior management team to confirm that the candidates make sense, to discuss any development steps that would help an individual to succeed in the position, to identify gaps where there are not sufficient candidates for a position, to encourage candidacies from other functional areas, and to assess the financial organization's progress toward its diversity objectives.</p>
<p class="h2">360 Reviews</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Either routinely or occasionally, CFOs may institute “360 reviews” that look at a professional from several vantage points: managers, peers, subordinates, and either internal or external customers. These reviews are usually conducted anonymously, then the results are shared confidentially with the individual.</p>
<p class="para">The 360 reviews can enhance self-awareness, helping individuals to understand third-party perceptions of their strengths and weaknesses. They typically are accompanied by a candid self-appraisal, sometimes with the help of a coach who works with the person to develop a game plan for the future.</p>
<p class="para">However, it is important that the CFO encourages a positive attitude toward these assessments, avoiding any defensiveness or consternation that an individual may feel about this relatively intimate mechanism for providing feedback.</p>
<p class="h2">Mentors and Coaches</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">High-potential employees are often assigned a mentor (typically a more senior member of the financial management team) who meets regularly and confidentially to discuss the individual's career aspirations and to offer career advice and encouragement. These mentors are usually supplementary to an individual's informal mentoring relationships throughout the finance organization; they help to ensure that everyone has someone who is looking out for them and provide a framework for discussing career alternatives.</p>
<p class="para">Some CFOs will go further by hiring a “coach”—usually a trained professional with experience in career counseling—who will work with an individual to construct a personalized development plan. However, if CFOs take this approach, they should clearly communicate that having a coach does not indicate a problem, but rather is a sign that the person is considered to have the potential to play a larger leadership role within the financial organization.</p>
<p class="h2">Recognition and Rewards</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given the flattening of most organizations—and the concomitant reduction in opportunities for promotions—CFOs are sponsoring more awards that recognize exceptional efforts and superior performance. This is especially important to the newer generations of young professionals, who generally have more desire to receive frequent positive feedback than did the preceding generations.</p>
<p class="para">Whether participating in company-wide programs or sponsoring specific finance programs, CFOs are enthusiastically embracing these opportunities to recognize the contributions of their people. The programs are particularly powerful in celebrating an achievement that has added shareholder value—such as a cost reduction idea—or in recognizing the contributions of team members who have worked well together.</p>
<p class="para">Although these programs often come with a financial award—typically cash, a gift certificate, or restricted stock—most employees respond more positively to the recognition itself than to the size of the monetary award, especially if the CFO communicates the award winners throughout the financial organization. The CFO should communicate not only the names of the winners, but also describe the reasons for their recognition.</p>
<p class="h2">External Courses</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Companies may choose to send their high-potential people to external seminars or business school management programs where they can interact with professionals from other companies and enhance their technical or leadership capabilities. This type of recognition provides tangible evidence to the individuals selected—as well as to the rest of the financial organization—that they are well-regarded by the CFO and the other financial leaders.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, although an MBA or other advanced degree is certainly not a prerequisite for advancement in most finance organizations, CFOs may want to encourage and support their people who choose to pursue these educational opportunities—usually during nights and weekends—and recognize their initiative toward self-improvement.</p>
<p class="para">However, CFOs should be cautious in directly sponsoring an executive MBA, as the explicit or implicit quid pro quo for this financial support can be quite tricky. For example, it can foment jealousies and fairness issues unless the criteria for this special treatment are well-understood and well-accepted by the organization. In addition, it can be very awkward if the individual accepts another position shortly after completing the MBA.</p>
<p class="h2">Informal Dialogues</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Most CFOs spend a considerable amount of their time in informal interactions with their financial organizations—ranging from brown bag lunches, to town hall meetings, to one-on-one discussions. For example, a CFO may schedule monthly breakfasts or lunches, with invitations going to all of the members of the finance staff who have birthdays that month.</p>
<p class="para">These types of informal settings provide opportunities for the CFO, as well as other financial leaders, to discuss their philosophies concerning career development, and to offer encouragement and advice to finance professionals in varying stages of their careers. It is also a great way to learn what is on their minds, perhaps surfacing morale or organizational issues that otherwise could go undetected.</p>
<p class="h2">Handwritten Notes</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">With the revolution in communication technologies, it is easier than ever for CFOs to use electronic tools to communicate broadly throughout the finance organization and to bypass traditional chains of command. For example, CFOs often send emails to announce organizational changes or to recognize individuals who have received awards or otherwise have achieved a noteworthy success.</p>
<p class="para">However, given how ubiquitous and facile these electronic communications have become, CFOs have surmised that handwritten notes can actually be more powerful than ever. Sending handwritten thank you or congratulatory notes can go a long way toward making their people feel special and appreciated.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c24-4">DIVERSITY</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A theme that permeates the development programs in most financial organizations is a focus on diversity—of gender, race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disabilities, geographies, backgrounds, and ideas. CFOs have embraced the notion that diversity is crucial to their company's business objectives and to the vitality of their financial organization.</p>
<p class="para">In most companies, CFOs are sponsoring actions to reinforce their commitment to diversity and to retain and develop the individuals who can help achieve and sustain a diverse culture. They also are visibly reaching out to support the trailblazers who are leading these efforts and serving as role models for others in the organization.</p>
<p class="para">The overriding point is that achieving their diversity objectives will not come naturally to most financial organizations; CFOs usually will need to establish goals and hold managers accountable for achieving them. It's the right thing to do, and it's certainly the best way for CFOs to ensure that they have access to the full array of talent.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c24-5">FUTURE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In developing financial talent, CFOs should be focused not only on their current organizational needs, but more important, on their requirements for the future. Of course, no one knows with certainty how the financial organizations will evolve, but it is a good bet that certain trends will continue, including:</p>

<li><span class="bold">Analytical:</span> Finance professionals will focus less on preparing information and more on adding value through their analysis and insights.</li><li><span class="bold">Externally Focused:</span> Finance professionals will be more focused on competitors, investors, customers, vendors, regulators, and governments.</li><li><span class="bold">Global:</span> Finance professionals will demonstrate global perspectives—as markets, products, supply chains, labor pools, and ideas integrate seamlessly across geographical borders.</li><li><span class="bold">Technologies:</span> Finance professionals will embrace rapidly changing technologies to stay cost competitive and to achieve continuous improvements in their capabilities.</li><li><span class="bold">Communications:</span> Finance professionals will emphasize effective communications—to ensure organizational alignment, to facilitate timely decision making, and to cut through the clutter of competing messages.</li><li><span class="bold">Unstructured:</span> Finance professionals will be comfortable with a less structured organization—with less emphasis on chains of command and organizational boundaries.</li><li><span class="bold">Leadership:</span> Finance professionals will lead through persuasion and not by command and control—as they drive performance and change.</li><li><span class="bold">Integrity:</span> For the finance professionals of tomorrow as well as today, integrity will continue to be the number one prerequisite for success.</li></ul>
