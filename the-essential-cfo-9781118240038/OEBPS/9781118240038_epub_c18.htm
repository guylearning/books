<p class="chaptertitle">Managing Financial Risks and Taxes</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs CAN DIRECTLY IMPACT THE COMPANY's financial performance through their management of financial risks and taxes. In managing these key functions, they are pursuing the twin goals of lowering costs and reducing volatility.</p>
<p class="para">Both of these objectives can add shareholder value, but they often entail tradeoffs that the CFO must weigh carefully.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c18-1">INSURANCE</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Purchasing third-party insurance is one of the most common mitigation strategies employed by companies against their enterprise risk exposures. Managing the insurance program is normally within the purview of the CFO, who is responsible for recommending the types and amounts of insurance to acquire and the amount of risk to be retained through self-insurance and deductibles. In addition, the CFO normally will partner with the general counsel in negotiating the terms for the policies that are purchased.</p>
<p class="h2">Types of Insurance</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For most companies, the insurance policies typically will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Property and Casualty:</span> Protection against physical loss and business interruption.</li><li><span class="bold">Liability:</span> Protection for product, auto, and other liability exposures.</li><li><span class="bold">Workers Compensation:</span> Coverage that meets state law or other mandates.</li><li><span class="bold">Group Life, Health, and Disability:</span> Coverage for employees in their benefits package.</li><li><span class="bold">Directors and Officers:</span> Protection for the company as well as individual directors and officers (Side A coverage) against shareholder claims and other lawsuits.</li><li><span class="bold">Umbrella:</span> Excess coverage above the limits in the other insurance policies.</li></ul>

<p class="para">Depending on a company's business profile, it also may acquire <span class="italic">errors and omissions</span> insurance or a <span class="italic">surety bond,</span> as well as policies for specialized purposes such as <span class="italic">aviation,</span> <span class="italic">marine,</span> or <span class="italic">boiler and machinery</span> insurance.</p>
<p class="h2">Insurance Brokers</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Because purchasing insurance requires highly specialized expertise, CFOs typically will engage insurance brokers, who can recommend programs based on current conditions in the market and help them obtain competitive rates and terms. The brokers also will assist in major insurance claims.</p>
<p class="para">Working with their insurance broker, CFOs will determine the best combination of self-insurance versus third-party protection. They then will obtain the insurance policies, with their choice of insurer typically based on the amount of coverage and price that is quoted, the insurer's reputation in the marketplace, the insurer's financial strength, the company's prior experience with the insurer, and the proposed terms.</p>
<p class="para">The policy terms can be especially important, such as the coverage that is excluded and the way that damages are calculated. For example, property insurance might exclude claims due to damage from mildew; casualty insurance might exclude floods, earthquakes, terrorism, and other perils; and business interruption insurance might not reimburse the company for allocated overhead costs.</p>
<p class="h2">Captive Insurance Companies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs also will determine strategies for administering the risk exposures that are retained by the company, including the most cost-effective way to manage claims. Also, many CFOs believe that self-insurance results in greater focus on reducing the number of claims and lowering the costs per claim.</p>
<p class="para">Depending on the size and scope of their program, CFOs often can save costs by establishing a captive insurance company. They are frequently based in Bermuda, which has a well-developed infrastructure for providing outsourcing  services to captives. A captive can also be established in the United States, with many located in Vermont due to state government support and an established infrastructure.</p>
<p class="para">Tax savings are usually important considerations in deciding whether to establish a captive and where it should be located.</p>
<p class="h2">Reduction of Losses</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As a best practice, CFOs will sponsor programs to reduce losses. These programs can result in cost savings for the risks retained through self-insurance or deductibles, and lower premiums for the risks covered by insurance policies. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="italic">Safety programs</span> to reduce lost time incidents and workers compensation costs.</li><li><span class="italic">Preventive maintenance programs</span> to reduce property claims for manufacturing or other facilities.</li><li><span class="italic">Reviews of facility locations</span> to highlight potential casualty risks and consider possible reconfigurations, including backup arrangements.</li><li><span class="italic">Disaster recovery plans</span> to mitigate the potential loss from business interruption.</li><li><span class="italic">Product quality programs</span> to reduce the risk of liability claims.</li><li><span class="italic">Employee training programs</span> to reduce the risk of errors and omissions.</li><li><span class="italic">Limits of liability</span> that are established through customer contracts.</li><li><span class="italic">Corporate governance policies</span> that reduce the risks of shareholder lawsuits.</li></ul>

<p class="para">By setting company-wide goals for reducing losses, CFOs can make a notable difference in their cost of risk. It is a major cost category for most companies and worthy of special focus by the CFO and the management team.</p>
<p class="para">This should also be a priority for the company's enterprise risk management program.</p>
<p class="h2">Cultivation of Insurers</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can influence both the availability and cost of their insurance by keeping their brokers and insurers informed about the company's financial condition and the steps that the company has taken to reduce risks. For example, the CFO can describe the company's efforts to reduce incidents, such as the implementation of product quality programs that can affect its liability exposure.</p>
<p class="para">Cultivating active communications with insurers can be especially important for companies that are experiencing financial difficulties. CFOs can reassure them that the company is taking steps to address the financial issues and that it fully intends to sustain good management standards and procedures going forward. Otherwise, the insurers may be concerned that the company will neglect its maintenance or other preventive programs.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c18-2">INTEREST RATES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Managing the company's exposure to fluctuating interest rates is central to the CFO's capital structure strategies; the CFO seeks to strike the right balance between obtaining low-cost capital and exposing the company to interest rate risk. On the one hand, fixed rate debt normally is more costly than floating rate debt. On the other hand, it is less risky, especially during times of market turbulence, which seem to be occurring more frequently and with greater severity.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should perform sensitivity analyses to determine the company's interest rate expense under various economic and business scenarios— identifying the potential impacts, not only to the company's income and cash flows, but also to its credit statistics and debt ratings. In performing these sensitivity analyses, the CFO will want to take into account any correlations between interest rate conditions (especially the shape of the yield curve) and their company's business outlook.</p>
<p class="para">For example, if a company is in an economically sensitive business—such as an industrial or commodity business—this may work as a natural hedge against higher interest rates, with the greater revenue and profit in a growth environment offsetting the higher interest expense.</p>
<p class="para">Conversely, a company's business outlook may be inversely correlated with the level of interest rates, meaning that a rise in rates will adversely affect the company, not only in higher interest expense, but also through lower operating income. The revenue of home builders, for example, is negatively impacted by higher rates, indicating that they should be cautious in using floating rate financing.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, if a company has limited ability to pass through price increases, it will be more vulnerable to inflation, which is usually correlated with higher interest rates. However, if the company has pricing power, the CFO can be more comfortable in employing floating rate debt.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c18-3">CURRENCIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Currency exposure is another financial risk that is managed by the CFO. This includes transaction exposures, which impact a company's cash flow, and translation exposures, which impact the accounting results due to the translation of revenue, expenses, and balance sheet items that are denominated in foreign currencies.</p>
<p class="h2">Hedging Policies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As a general observation, most CFOs will consider hedging transaction exposures but will not hedge translation exposures. They reason that hedging should be focused on <span class="italic">economic</span> exposures, which generally are defined to be cash rather than accounting results.</p>
<p class="para">For example, they may enter into forward contracts for part or all of their forecasted cross-border revenues and expenses, usually through a centralized treasury function that nets the currency exposures throughout a global company. They also may hedge payments that are scheduled to be made in a foreign currency in the near future (e.g., a cross-border acquisition). Also, companies that receive substantial royalties from foreign locations may hedge their forecasted cash receipts or they may hedge a dividend payment that is anticipated from an international subsidiary.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs also will establish policies for how much of their transaction exposures will be hedged under normal circumstances. These policies can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hedging 100 percent of the net exposures.</li><li>Hedging a portion of the net exposures (say, 50 percent).</li><li>Not hedging unless an exposure is material or unusual.</li></ul>

<p class="para">They usually will analyze their currency risks on a company-wide basis; they will offset the pluses and minuses for each currency and then analyze the net exposures under alternative scenarios. Although a currency exposure may be material to an individual country or business unit, its net impact may not be material to the company as a whole, in which case hedging strategies may not be warranted.</p>
<p class="h2">Hedging Transactions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">If CFOs decide to hedge their transaction exposures, the best practice is to centralize the implementation within the corporate treasury group. Often the company will work with a bank to establish a netting system through which the exposures are offset against each other, with only the residue risks being hedged through a <span class="italic">forward</span> contract, a <span class="italic">swap,</span> an <span class="italic">option,</span> or a combination of a swap and an option (a <span class="italic">swaption</span>).</p>
<p class="para">The most common hedging transaction is a forward contract, which is the purchase or sale of the currency on a future date that matches the estimated timing of the cash inflow or outflow. It can be accomplished through an over the counter transaction with a bank or through a futures contract on an exchange (such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange).</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Netting</span> can substantially reduce the cost and complexity of hedging strategies; it can be implemented unilaterally (within a single company) or in conjunction with other companies (through a bilateral or multilateral netting system).</p>
<p class="para">As an alternative, hedging can also be accomplished by investing excess cash in the currency or borrowing in the currency through a short-term credit line.</p>
<p class="para">In most companies, the hedging activities are conducted as a risk mitigation strategy and not as a profit center. Normally, they will not enter into a futures transaction unless there is an underlying transaction that is being hedged—and they will prohibit <span class="italic">speculation</span> on currency movements.</p>
<p class="para">However, CFOs may consider currency outlooks in the execution of their hedging strategies. For example, they may decide to hedge only a portion of their exposures or they may decide to use an option rather than a forward contract.</p>
<p class="h2">Long-Term Planning</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">While CFOs usually do not hedge their translation exposures, they will consider these exposures in their long-term business planning. For example, a decision where to locate a processing center or a research facility may be partially motivated by the outlook for the local currency.</p>
<p class="para">Generally, it is better to locate cost centers in a country with a depreciating currency. However, if the cash will be trapped in a local currency due to tax or other constraints, then the depreciating currency can be a disadvantage due to the declining value of the cash.</p>
<p class="para">Moreover, any investments in fixed assets in a country with a weak currency will decline in value over time, which will be reflected in <span class="italic">other</span> <span class="italic">comprehensive</span> <span class="italic">income.</span> This reduces shareholders' equity, but does not affect net income or cash flow.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c18-4">COMMODITIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For many CFOs, raw materials can represent a significant component of their cost structure and a major exposure to cyclical and systemic risks. This raises the question whether they should seek to manage this exposure.</p>
<p class="para">Formerly, companies often hedged their raw material pricing through vertical integration. However, as part of the move toward more pure play investments, companies generally have been deemphasizing ownership of their raw materials. For example, media companies have divested their newsprint plants, and DuPont abandoned its strategy of backward integration into oil (through its spinoff of Conoco).</p>
<p class="para">The strategic bias today is not to integrate operations that involve different financial characteristics and that require different management skills. Also, investors can diversify their exposures to commodities through their investment portfolio. Therefore, companies tend not to own their raw material suppliers, but regularly provide information to investors concerning the size and nature of their exposures, including the sensitivity of their profits to commodity price movements.</p>
<p class="h2">Hedging Strategies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For commodities with active futures markets—such as oil, farm products, and metals—CFOs may consider hedging part or all of their exposures through forwards or options. They typically will consider not only their expectations for future price movements, but also the relative costs of the contracts. For example, they will consider the shape of the forward curve—whether the future price is greater than the spot price (<span class="italic">contango</span>) or lower than the spot price (<span class="italic">backwardation</span>). In addition, the relative cost of options will reflect the market's expectations for volatility.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs will also consider whether competitors are hedging their exposures. For example, a transportation company may place itself in a competitive disadvantage if it is the only company that hedges its exposure to the price of oil. If oil prices escalate, the CFO is a hero, but if the price declines sharply, the company may not be able to match competitors' pricing strategies. As an alternative to hedging through the futures markets, CFOs may pursue hedging strategies through long-term contracts with their suppliers. For example, they can specify fixed prices or can establish floors and ceilings, or perhaps construct a formula that shares the impact from market price changes between the parties to the agreement.</p>
<p class="para">In any event, it is probably a good idea for CFOs to let investors know the parameters of the company's hedging strategies so that they can build this variable into their earnings model.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c18-5">INFLATION</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Although relatively quiescent in recent decades, inflation historically has been a significant financial risk for most companies, with the possibility of destroying considerable value and creating troublesome management challenges. The 1970s were a particularly vexing period for CFOs in the United States due to the combination of high inflation and a sluggish economy—causing “<span class="italic">stagflation</span>” to become part of their lexicon and high on their list of chronic worries. Moreover, if operations are located in countries with histories of hyper inflation, CFOs need to be continuously on guard against value erosion.</p>
<p class="para">Given the expansionary fiscal and monetary strategies being implemented throughout Europe and the United States, there is at least a reasonable chance of an acceleration of inflationary pressures—perhaps not to the same degree as in the past, but certainly at higher levels than being experienced currently. And emerging countries will be challenged to sustain their high growth rates without igniting wage pressures and other root causes of inflation.</p>
<p class="h2">Possible Strategies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In response, CFOs undoubtedly will be analyzing their company's potential exposures to inflation—determining the potential impacts on revenue and costs, including wages. After analyzing their exposure to inflation scenarios, they then can consider what responses might be appropriate—either in anticipation of a potential issue or as a contingency if inflation resurfaces in the future.</p>
<p class="para">These action steps can include structural changes to the company's business model, such as its pricing formulas, its payment terms, its supply chain arrangements, or the location of its facilities. CFOs also can explore alternative work force strategies, such as modifications to the compensation packages, more or less use of outsourcing arrangements, or more investments in automation and other labor saving technologies.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, many CFOs are taking advantage of historically low interest rates to obtain long-term debt at fixed rates, either to refinance existing debt or to obtain new debt financing—thus providing some protection against the possibility that inflation will cause interest rates to rise in the future. Given the massive fiscal deficits, locking in fixed rates seems like a good bet and a prudent hedge against a revival of inflation in the future.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c18-6">PENSION FUND</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For companies with legacy pension plans that pay defined benefits, the volatility of interest rates and stock prices can represent a significant financial exposure: If their unfunded liabilities increase, this equates to a debt obligation that must be repaid over time.</p>
<p class="para">The liabilities in the pension plan will increase with a decline in interest rates and the assets will decrease in tandem with the stock market: exactly the conditions that prevailed during the financial crisis, causing a surge in unfunded liabilities. This was a wakeup call to many CFOs, highlighting a financial exposure that they would like to mitigate or even eliminate. They generally are considering two strategies: shifting to defined contributions and matching assets and liabilities.</p>
<p class="h2">Shifting to Defined Contributions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The first mitigation strategy is to shift the benefit plans to defined contribution payments. This can involve the substitution of greater 401(k) matching or other defined contribution arrangements for all new hires and freezing pension fund accruals for existing employees, perhaps with a grandfather provision to allow the accumulation of additional benefits for a set number of years or through a formula based on the ages of the employees.</p>
<p class="para">However, while these structural changes can gradually reduce the accumulation of liabilities over time, they do not address the legacy obligations, which represent the bulk of most companies' exposure. Furthermore, the changes will be unpopular among existing employees, perhaps creating morale or even retention issues. Therefore, CFOs should be mindful of the potential impact on their company's human resource strategies, including their employee value proposition.</p>
<p class="h2">Matching Assets and Liabilities</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The second mitigation strategy—which can address both legacy and new pension fund exposures—is to achieve greater matching of assets and liabilities. This strategy involves funding the pension funds with securities that <span class="italic">match the duration</span> of the liabilities owed to pensioners. This generally means increasing the assets that are held as debt rather than equity securities and increasing the average maturity and duration of the debt securities.</p>
<p class="para">In addition to reducing the volatility of the company's earnings, matching the duration also ameliorates the risk of having to inject additional contributions in the future. Thus, it has cash flow as well as accounting advantages.</p>
<p class="para">However, implementation of this second strategy has a practical constraint: The rate of return assumption that is used in the calculation of unfunded liabilities is based on the mix of assets held in the portfolio. Because equities are assumed to have higher returns than debt, the shift to more debt will cause a decline in the assumed rate of return, thus increasing the unfunded liabilities and the reported pension expense (but not affecting cash flow).</p>
<p class="para">Given this constraint, CFOs generally are reconciled to a <span class="italic">gradual</span> shift in their pension fund assets, considering any increases in stock values or interest rates as opportunities to rebalance a portion of their portfolios. In addition, they are making voluntary contributions to the pension fund, thus providing more flexibility to modify the portfolio's composition without increasing the net amount of unfunded liabilities.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c18-7">TAX PLANNING</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another way that CFOs can directly drive financial performance is through tax planning, which can dramatically impact a company's effective tax rate and net income, as well as generate substantial free cash flow through tax credits and deferrals.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, tax planning professionals are the consummate examples of people who require highly specialized expertise; and unless CFOs have come up through the tax function, they are unlikely to add much value in the identification and analysis of potential tax planning strategies. Nevertheless, CFOs can make positive contributions through their oversight of the tax responsibilities.</p>
<p class="h2">Policies and Objectives</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can provide overall leadership to the company's tax function, establishing policies and objectives that seek to strike the right balance between risk and reward. For example, tax strategies may produce demonstrable near-term benefits, but may involve exposures to unfavorable tax audits or may constrain the company's future flexibility due to the legal structures that are required for implementation.</p>
<p class="para">In the current environment, CFOs need to communicate their philosophy concerning aggressive tax planning initiatives. For example, to what extent is the company willing to consider complex strategies that have not been specifically approved by the tax authorities, but which are supported by opinions from law firms? Or, what is the company's attitude toward the location of activities in offshore jurisdictions strictly for tax avoidance purposes?</p>
<p class="para">Because tax planning decisions can have political and business ramifications—especially for companies that do much of their business with governmental entities—it is essential that these considerations be factored into the tax planning equation.</p>
<p class="para">The bottom line is that CFOs should nurture and encourage creativity among tax professionals, while also providing guidance and context for using their skill sets in the best way possible.</p>
<p class="h2">Curbs on Complexity</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can also help to moderate the natural tendency of tax planning strategies to become excessively complex. Over the years, most companies tend to overlay tax strategies that respond to specific circumstances and opportunities. Especially for long-established multinationals, these strategies tend to build upon one another, resulting in an organization chart for tax entities that becomes mind-bogglingly complicated—with boxes and lines crisscrossing each other like an Etch-A-Sketch gone wild.</p>
<p class="para">Unfortunately, the complexities of these “spaghetti” charts have a cost, not only in the fees paid to audit the various legal entities, but more significantly, in the control issues that can arise from the proliferation of reporting requirements. This control risk is particularly pronounced if a company has experienced turnover in the tax function or has failed to document the transactions adequately. In response, CFOs should:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Document:</span> Request that all of the entities and reporting requirements be documented, including an explanation of the reasons for each entity's existence.</li><li><span class="bold">Eliminate:</span> Initiate periodic reviews of the tax entities to determine if some can be eliminated or if their ownership structures can be simplified.</li><li><span class="bold">Constrain:</span> Exercise caution in the establishment of additional entities (e.g., in connection with an acquisition) with a relatively high burden of proof to add more complexity.</li></ul>

<p class="para">Complexity can also make it difficult to get answers to seemingly simple questions. By aptitude and training, tax professionals often are very detail-oriented and reluctant to offer imprecise conclusions. However, this preference  to perform a complete analysis—with full consideration of all the possible  permutations—can impede broader decision making (e.g., a decision whether to repatriate cash from a foreign location).</p>
<p class="para">In response, CFOs can encourage tax professionals to provide “<span class="italic">ballpark</span>” answers—with the details to come later—and reassure them that there will be no recriminations if their initial estimates are subsequently revised.</p>
<p class="h2">Holistic Analyses</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In a similar vein, CFOs can help ensure that tax decisions reflect a full range of considerations, not just the likely tax impact. For example, tax professionals may conclude that cash should not be repatriated from a foreign location because it would have a net tax cost. However, a more holistic analysis might conclude that because of the differential between the company's cost of capital versus what is being earned on the trapped cash, it may be desirable to absorb the tax cost and return the cash to shareholders.</p>
<p class="para">The CFO is in a good position to know when there are competing considerations in a decision and can help ensure that all of these considerations are vetted in the analysis of alternatives. In addition, CFOs can encourage active coordination among the tax, treasury, controller, and financial planning functions in their review of tax planning strategies.</p>
<p class="h2">Net Operating Losses</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can also play a leadership role in preserving and maximizing the value of tax assets, such as net operating losses (NOLs) that can shelter future income.</p>
<p class="para">Although the tax rules in the United States specify that a company has  20 years to utilize its NOLs, from a practical perspective these tax assets will be subject to a valuation allowance if they are not expected to be utilized in a more foreseeable time period. Therefore, given this potential accounting issue and considering the time value of money, CFOs will want to consider strategies for accelerating their usage. Making more pre-tax income is the best strategy, but transactional strategies also should be considered.</p>
<p class="para">For example, the availability of NOLs may make a divestiture more desirable than otherwise: The company likely will be able to offset any gain on the sale and the buyer likely will pay a higher price due to a write-up of the tax basis of the assets being sold. Moreover, even in the case of a stock deal, the sale can be characterized as an asset transaction for tax purposes (a Section <span class="italic">338(h)(10) election</span>).</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs can consider leasing transactions—including sale/ leasebacks—or joint venture arrangements that utilize the NOLs. They also can consider prepaying debt to reduce interest expense and perhaps record a taxable gain on the transaction.</p>
<p class="para">Another potential issue with NOLs is the restriction on their use in the event of a change of control (<span class="italic">a Section 382 transaction</span>). This applies to a sale of the company, but it also can be triggered if a majority ownership stake is accumulated by 5 percent holders during a three year period. If this provision becomes applicable, then the annual use of the NOLs becomes subject to a ceiling that is based generally on the prevailing municipal bond rate and the company's market value at the time of the ownership change. This is one more reason why it is desirable to use NOLs as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="h2">Transfer Pricing</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">With the differences in tax rates throughout the world, much value can be created by recording profits in lower tax countries. Therefore, CFOs typically will focus on transfer pricing among the locations.</p>
<p class="para">The basic standard is that the transfer pricing should reflect a market rate. In some cases, the goods or services will have a market value that can be verified objectively, but more likely the value will be estimated, involving some subjectivity.</p>
<p class="para">From time to time, the CFO should initiate a review of the company's transfer pricing policies —identifying opportunities where the pricing should be changed. This review should involve the business units involved since any changes in the transfer pricing for tax purposes generally should be reflected in the accounting assumptions as well.</p>
<p class="h2">Deductions and Credits</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">With all of the complexities of national tax codes throughout the world—as well as all of the state and local tax jurisdictions in the United States—it is difficult to keep track of the plethora of incentive programs that may apply to a company's activities. And with the various attempts to stimulate the economy, new opportunities keep arising.</p>
<p class="para">There is real money to be harvested from these programs (e.g., subsidies for hiring new workers, for investing in research and development, or for taking environmentally friendly actions). However, taking advantage of these programs often requires extensive investigation and documentation, and the data typically is not easily retrieved from the company's information technology systems.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs can sponsor projects to capture the potential rewards, ensuring that someone is personally accountable and that there are sufficient resources committed. Also, they can establish targets for realizing benefits and enlist additional internal support (e.g., from the human resources and information technology departments).</p>
<p class="para">In some cases, CFOs may decide to hire a third-party firm that will invest the resources and apply the expertise to obtain the tax benefits. They usually will provide these services in exchange for a share of the proceeds.</p>
<p class="h2">Tax Compliance</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">While CFOs definitely should take advantage of any potential benefits from the tax codes, they should also ensure that the company is fully compliant with its obligations to collect taxes. This is especially true with respect to state taxes in the United States.</p>
<p class="para">Given their financial woes, states are imposing new taxes—such as sales taxes on online sales—and are employing third-party firms to audit compliance with respect to a wide range of taxes and fees. For example, companies are being audited with respect to their escheatment practices.</p>
<p class="para">Also, cross-border transfer pricing is becoming subject to more scrutiny. Thus, as CFOs review their transfer prices, they should also ensure that the company is complying with the requirements for calculating and documenting the pricing.</p>
<p class="h2">Tax Reform</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Finally, CFOs should be contemplating the ramifications of potential changes in the tax rules. This is especially timely given the possibility of corporate tax reform in the United States. For example, what would be the impact if the United States changes to a territorial rather than a global tax system? Or what would be the ramifications if reforms are enacted to eliminate various deductions in exchange for a lower tax rate?</p>
<p class="para">Understanding the company's sensitivity to the various possibilities in tax reform can help CFOs to consider potential action steps. They also will be more prepared to address investor questions concerning the direction and magnitude of the potential impacts.</p>
