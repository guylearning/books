<p class="chaptertitle">Considering Dividends and Repurchases</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">IN REVIEWING THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PROGRAM, CFOs will be mindful of the alternative uses of capital to pay dividends to shareholders or to repurchase the company's shares. They will implicitly compare reinvesting cash in the business versus returning cash to shareholders and will seek the best combination to deliver shareholder value.</p>
<p class="para">The alternatives for returning cash to shareholders include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiating a regular dividend payment</li><li>Increasing an existing dividend rate</li><li>Paying a one-time special dividend</li><li>Repurchasing shares via a tender offer</li><li>Repurchasing shares in the open market</li></ul>

<p class="para">The CFO will evaluate these alternatives in light of the company's dividend policy; the inherent trade-offs between dividends and share repurchases; and the company's strategies for delivering total shareholder return.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c06-1">DIVIDEND POLICY ALTERNATIVES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Establishing and communicating a dividend policy is fundamental to a company's investor value proposition. The basic alternatives are not paying a dividend, paying a token dividend, maintaining a constant dividend, achieving consistent growth, targeting a payout ratio, targeting a yield, or varying with cash requirements.</p>
<p class="h2">Not Paying a Dividend</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">By not paying a dividend, a company is essentially communicating that it has higher return uses for its capital. This policy is often associated with technology and other high-growth companies, but it is also employed by highly leveraged and economically sensitive companies or by smaller companies that have limited access to the capital markets.</p>
<p class="para">It maximizes the company's financial flexibility, but introduces greater uncertainty concerning the company's total shareholder return—which usually translates into more volatility in the stock price and a higher cost of equity.</p>
<p class="h2">Paying a Token Dividend</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A company that has historically not paid dividends may declare a relatively small dividend that produces a very modest dividend yield. This signals to investors that it is primarily a growth company, but that it is also focused on shareholder value.</p>
<p class="para">This policy indicates a company in transition—and likely to raise its dividend fairly rapidly as the business matures.</p>
<p class="h2">Maintaining a Constant Dividend</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A company that wants to preserve cash may choose to maintain its existing dividend, but not plan any increases for the foreseeable future. This is often the path followed by companies in stagnant or declining businesses or companies that have recently made a large cash investment—such as a major acquisition.</p>
<p class="para">This policy avoids disappointing investors with a dividend cut, but the company is essentially treading water over the near term.</p>
<p class="h2">Achieving Consistent Growth</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Achieving consistent dividend growth is a common strategy among well-established companies that have relatively predictable cash flows and a solid balance sheet. They typically will tout the number of consecutive years that they have increased their annual dividend.</p>
<p class="para">This policy reinforces an image of stability, attracting investors who are seeking income protection as well as growth and who expect the dividend to keep up with inflation.</p>
<p class="h2">Targeting a Payout Ratio</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Companies often will relate their dividend to a targeted percentage of net income (or free cash flow). It communicates an intention to increase the dividend, but proportionate to its growth rate in earnings per share.</p>
<p class="para">This policy signals the company's intention to achieve long-term dividend growth, while preserving its flexibility concerning the timing and size of the increases.</p>
<p class="h2">Offering an Attractive Yield</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Companies that are owned primarily by yield-oriented investors may base their dividends on comparative yields in the market—not only in comparison with other stocks, but also in comparison with fixed-income alternatives, such as Treasuries or municipal bonds. It is often employed by companies in mature businesses that have ample financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="para">This policy treats the dividend as fundamental to the company's strategy for delivering total return to its shareholders and generally is associated with a less volatile stock.</p>
<p class="h2">Estimating Cash Requirements</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another approach is to make the dividend conditional on the company's cash sources and uses, essentially paying any “residual” cash as a dividend. This has some appeal in theory, but is impossible from a practical point of view for most public companies. One-time dividends are generally not favored by investors and share repurchases represent a much more efficient alternative for returning surplus cash.</p>
<p class="para">However, in determining the dividend policy, the company's long-term earnings and cash flow projections are certainly criteria that should be considered. For example, if the projections show the company with negative free cash flow, it probably would be unwise to initiate a dividend, while substantial free cash flow would indicate greater flexibility.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, establishing a dividend policy based on residual cash can make a great deal of sense for private companies, helping their shareholders to manage their equity commitments and providing them with a source of liquidity.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c06-2">DIVIDEND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should be mindful of a number of considerations that can influence the choice among dividend policy alternatives and the decision between dividends and share repurchases.</p>
<p class="h2">Long-Term Commitment</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Most public companies want to maintain their existing dividend rate, at minimum. Reducing their dividend is generally considered a serious breach with investor expectations and unless signaled well in advance for legitimate business reasons—such as a clearly superior use for the funds—it can result in a dramatically negative impact on the stock price. In the case of private companies, their shareholders also have expectations concerning dividend payments and they likewise may be upset if these expectations are not fulfilled.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, CFOs should analyze the company's ability to pay the dividend—even during downturns in the economy—and regard the dividend as equivalent to a fixed obligation. Indeed, this is the primary advantage of returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases rather than dividend payments; it creates much less of an obligation and thus preserves the company's flexibility.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, the rating agencies will consider the payment of dividends to be an obligation that can affect the company's debt ratings, especially in comparison with an open market share repurchase program. However, this is usually a relatively minor factor in their assessments of credit quality—provided that the company's free cash flow can clearly accommodate the payments and the company does not reduce or suspend its dividend, which the agencies will view as symptomatic of underlying credit or liquidity issues.</p>
<p class="h2">Management Signal</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Maintaining or increasing the dividend rate not only provides a tangible return to investors, but also signals management's confidence in the company's future outlook. Because investors know that companies are extremely reluctant to reduce future dividend payments, they perceive that the company expects relatively stable or growing earnings over the long run.</p>
<p class="para">This signal can result in a positive reaction from investors. However, it can also create the possibility of disappointing them if the dividend is subsequently suspended or reduced. This is an especially important consideration for companies that are in decline and whose dividends may be perceived as unsustainable.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, if a high-growth company initiates a dividend, it can signal that it no longer has attractive reinvestment opportunities, which can temper investor enthusiasm for the stock.</p>
<p class="h2">Market Norms</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As a benchmark, CFOs should be aware of the typical payout ratios and dividend yields in the stock market. For example, the average annual dividend yield for the S&amp;P 500 tends to cluster around 2 percent, but exceeded 3 percent during the market meltdown in 2008. The average annual payout ratio tends to be around 40 to 50 percent, although this ratio can deviate wildly from year to year.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs should be mindful of the typical payouts and yields in their industry. If a company's dividend policy deviates too much from competitors' policies, it may distort comparisons by equity analysts.</p>
<p class="para">For example, many analysts use a shorthand calculation of a company's price/earnings ratio in comparison with its earnings growth rate (the <span class="italic">“PEG” ratio</span>). This can penalize a company that pays a high dividend yield in comparison with a competitor that does not pay a dividend.</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>

</div>

<p class="h2">Shareholder Base</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The choice of dividend policy should be consistent with the company's shareholder base. For example, if the CFO is targeting “value” or “yield” investors as potential shareholders, instituting or increasing a dividend is likely to be attractive to them.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, certain mutual funds and other institutional investors have investment criteria that prefer, or even require, regular annual increases in the company's dividend. Therefore, CFOs may want to consider annual increases—even if relatively small—as part of their dividend policy. This can be especially helpful in attracting “growth and income” investors.</p>
<p class="h2">Dividend Discount Model</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Many investors use the dividend discount model in their evaluation of stocks. This model essentially says that the value of the stock is a function of its annual dividend, the growth rate for the dividend, and the company's cost of equity capital. For example, if a company pays a dividend of $1.00, grows its dividend in perpetuity at 5 percent, and has a 10 percent cost of equity capital, its stock is worth $20.00 ($1.00 / [10% -5%]).</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, if a company can convince investors that it will grow its dividend consistently at a given rate, this will be reflected in its stock market valuation. However, investors tend to be skeptical that a growth rate can be sustained into perpetuity. They usually will project the dividend growth rate for a foreseeable period (say, five to ten years) and then assume a lower rate of growth into perpetuity (say, 2 to 4 percent per annum).</p>
<p class="h2">Earnings Growth Rate</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Investors will also factor the dividend payout ratio into their expectations for a company's growth rate in earnings. They will analyze a company's return on equity and compute the percentage of its earnings that will be reinvested in the business.</p>
<p class="para">For example, if a company earns a 15 percent return on its equity capital and is targeting a payout ratio of 40 percent, the implied earnings growth rate is 9 percent (15% × .6).</p>
<p class="h2">Stock Options</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A significant increase or decrease in the dividend will affect the value of a company's stock options (the Black-Scholes formula uses a company's dividend yield as one of its variables, causing the option's value to decline if the yield is increased). Therefore, if CFOs are considering a material change in dividend policy, they should investigate the potential impact on the company's incentive compensation programs, especially whether the existing employee option agreements address this issue.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c06-3">SPECIAL DIVIDENDS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle"><span class="italic">Public companies</span> in recent years seldom have announced one-time or “special” dividends, although Microsoft notably paid a $32 billion special dividend in 2004. Special dividends were declared more frequently in the past, but they have generally fallen out of favor with investors, who prefer share repurchases as a vehicle for returning cash to shareholders through a one-time payment. Investors like the reduction in shares outstanding that is achieved through a share repurchase, while they often liken a one-time dividend to a “sugar high” that has no lasting impact on the stock price.</p>
<p class="para">The most common use of special dividends today is in connection with mergers and acquisitions, where the target pays a dividend to shareholders in advance of a stock-for-stock merger. This allows the target's surplus cash to be returned to shareholders, reducing the amount of equity capital that needs to be issued by the acquirer, thereby decreasing the dilution to existing shareholders.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Private companies</span> often declare a one-time dividend to their shareholders. Unlike a public company, a private company isn't expected to maintain a consistent payment, which allows more flexibility in returning cash to its shareholders.</p>
<p class="para">One-time dividends are especially common in connection with a debt refinancing by a leveraged buyout. A portion of the proceeds from the refinancing is paid to the private equity investors, reducing their equity stake in the company and enhancing their return on investment.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c06-4">DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Declarations of dividends require approval from the board of directors. If the quarterly dividend is remaining unchanged, CFOs typically will provide limited or no supporting materials to the board. However, if the recommendation involves a change in the existing dividend rate or a shift in the company's dividend policy, CFOs usually will prepare analytical materials that support the proposed action.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs typically will show the company's history of dividend payments; the percentage of its earnings that have been paid out as dividends each year (its payout ratio); its current dividend yield; its average dividend yield in previous years; and its projections for earnings and free cash flow over the planning horizon.</p>
<p class="para">They will also provide comparisons of the company's dividend policy with other companies in their peer group—either companies in the same industry or else companies that have similar growth rates and asset intensities. The comparisons usually focus on the current yield (annualized dividend as a percentage of share price), the payout ratio (annualized dividend as a percentage of earnings per share or free cash flow per share), and the dividend growth rate (compounded annual increase over time; for example, over five- or ten-year periods).</p>
<p class="para">Finally, they may want to highlight trends in the broader stock market—using either general or industry-specific indexes—and provide an analysis of the company's shareholder base, indicating any preferences for dividends among the major holders.</p>
<p class="h2">Dividend Announcement</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Declaring a dividend is a material event that usually is communicated through a press release immediately after receiving board approval. Therefore, if the dividend action may come as a surprise to investors, CFOs should be sure that their investor relations and corporate communications people are prepared to field questions. They also may want to provide a heads up to the rating agencies and consider some outreach to major shareholders after the change is announced.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, if a company is planning a dividend action that is likely to be positively received, CFOs may want to coordinate board approval with a venue where they can directly communicate the action to investors—such as an investor day presentation, an investor conference, or an earnings conference call.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c06-5">REPURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Share repurchases are commonly employed by both public and private companies to return cash to their shareholders and manage their shares outstanding. They have a number of advantages compared with dividends, but also some risks in their implementation.</p>
<p class="h2">Flexible Payments</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The most significant advantage of repurchases compared with dividends is their greater flexibility. They are considered to be less of a long-term commitment and are especially well-suited for redeploying one-time sources of cash such as a divestiture or a refinancing.</p>
<p class="para">This flexibility is more pronounced in an open market program than a cash tender. In an open market program, the company usually maintains an ability to suspend the program due to unforeseen events.</p>
<p class="h2">EPS Growth Rate</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Share repurchases can accelerate the earnings per share growth rate due to the reduction in shares outstanding—essentially increasing the leverage on the earnings. This higher growth rate can have a positive impact on the company's P/E multiple. For example, if a company is growing its earnings at a 10 percent  rate, repurchasing 5 percent of the shares will increase its growth rate to  16 percent if the shares are acquired immediately and to 13 percent if the shares are purchased over the course of the year.</p>
<p class="para">The advantages of repurchasing shares are especially pronounced in a low interest rate environment. The use of cash has a relatively low opportunity cost, especially when compared with the company's cost of equity.</p>
<p class="h2">Tax Advantage</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Share repurchases formerly had a tax advantage in the United States due to the lower rate on capital gains in comparison with the ordinary income rate that was applied to dividends. However, this difference in personal income tax rates no longer exists—at least until Congress revisits the subject in connection with the expiration of the current tax rules at the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, share repurchases still have a tax advantage compared with dividends: Only the shareholders who sell their stock in a repurchase will experience a taxable event, while a dividend is a taxable event for all taxpaying shareholders.</p>
<p class="h2">Positive Signal</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">It is often argued that announcements of share repurchases are positive signals to investors, indicating that management has a favorable view about the value of the company's stock. As a result, the stock price may increase upon the announcement of a buyback program.</p>
<p class="para">However, the recent track record of many companies has called this presumption into question, with their shares often trading below the average price that was paid in the repurchase programs. Indeed, because share repurchase programs are often initiated when times are good, they may reflect a perverse bias toward buying when share prices are high, not when they're low.</p>
<p class="para">In any event, unless a company repurchases shares regularly on a sustained basis over time, it runs the risk that its timing is inopportune. And as CFOs can appreciate, predicting the future stock price is always a gamble, largely dependent on economic and financial conditions outside the company's control.</p>
<p class="h2">Debt Leverage Target</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Share repurchases can be flexible vehicles for rebalancing a company's capital structure. For example, if the company has more equity capital than indicated by its debt leverage targets, it can increase its leverage through a repurchase, thus lowering the company's cost of capital. For this reason, CFOs may want to combine a repurchase program with a debt issuance, especially if the financial markets are favorable.</p>
<p class="para">However, if CFOs are too aggressive in rebalancing their capital structure, they run the risk of repurchasing shares and then having to reissue shares in the future. The key is to distinguish between changes in the company's debt leverage that are relatively permanent versus those that are transitory.</p>
<p class="h2">Cash Flow Savings</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">When shares are repurchased, a company avoids the need to pay dividends on those shares going forward. This can result in significant cash flow savings when compounded over time, especially if the company has a relative high yield or a dividend policy that calls for annual increases.</p>
<p class="para">Companies with relatively high yields can realize a positive cash flow arbitrage versus the after-tax earnings on their cash balance or the after-tax cost of their debt. For example, if the company has a dividend yield of 3.0 percent and a marginal tax rate of 35 percent, this equates to a breakeven pre-tax cost of debt of 4.6 percent (3.0%/.65).</p>
<p class="h2">Offset to Dilution</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A common justification for repurchases is to offset the dilution due to stock issuances, with companies often establishing an explicit goal of not increasing their shares outstanding. The sources of dilution can include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bolditalic">Incentive Compensation:</span> Shares may be issued as restricted stock and stock options in a company's incentive compensation programs. Restricted stock has two advantages versus options in managing a share repurchase program: It involves fewer potential shares to be repurchased and there is greater certainty concerning the number of shares that will need to be repurchased.</li><li><span class="bolditalic">Mergers and Acquisitions:</span> Shares may be issued in a merger or acquisition to achieve a tax-free exchange. A repurchase program can offset these issuances with no effect on either the tax or accounting treatment for the transaction. Often the acquirer will state its intention to repurchase the shares when the transaction is announced, allowing analysts to make pro forma adjustments to both shares outstanding and earnings per share.</li><li><span class="bolditalic">Employee Purchase Programs:</span> Employee stock purchase programs formerly represented a potentially significant issuance of shares. However, after the Enron debacle, companies generally stopped encouraging employee stock ownership and the accounting treatment was changed: The maximum discount to avoid an expense was reduced from 15 to 5 percent and any “look back” pricing was deemed to be a stock option that must be expensed. Consequently, these programs are now a relatively minor source of dilution for most companies, and the issuances can be easily offset with share repurchases.</li><li><span class="bolditalic">Dividend Reinvestment Programs:</span> Another minor source of dilution can be the company's dividend reinvestment program. However, the issuance of shares through these programs is fairly predictable and can be offset by repurchases.</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Private Company Repurchases</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Private companies often will repurchase shares from minority shareholders or employees—especially those who have left the company—as a way to provide them with liquidity and to stay below the maximum number of shareholders to remain a private company. The transactions typically involve a valuation of the shares by an objective third party.</p>
<p class="para">However, the need for this type of repurchase program may become less compelling with the advent of secondary markets for private shares— provided that these markets gain traction and that their regulatory issues can be addressed.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, private companies may repurchase equity from their venture capital or private equity investors, using either the proceeds from a refinancing or surplus free cash flow from operations. This is a fairly typical transaction and can enhance the investors' discounted returns on investment.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c06-6">OPEN MARKET PROGRAMS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Open market programs represent the lion's share of share repurchases. The company announces its intention to repurchase a target dollar amount of shares (or sometimes a target number of shares) over an indefinite time period, although they generally are expected to be accomplished within a one- to two-year time period. This approach communicates the company's intention, while still giving it the flexibility to suspend the program in the event of financial duress or due to acquisitions or other unforeseen strategic actions. Moreover, it facilitates a dollar averaging approach to the repurchases, mitigating the risk that the company is buying shares at the peak of the market.</p>
<p class="para">In implementing an open market program, CFOs will engage an investment bank to act as the company's agent in executing the transactions. They will organize a procedure to provide instructions each day concerning the price and volume parameters. The number of shares that can be repurchased each day is subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, but block purchases are exempt, giving the CFO considerable flexibility to set the volume targets. The CFO also will partner with the general counsel to ensure that discretionary repurchases are not made during “blackout” periods or if the company possesses material information that has not been publicly disclosed.</p>
<p class="para">Shareholders will expect regular updates concerning the status of the repurchase program (e.g., in connection with earnings announcements or investor presentations). CFOs will want to keep investors well-informed, especially if a decision is made to suspend or terminate a program; otherwise, they can lose credibility in announcing future programs.</p>
<p class="h2">Accelerated Share Repurchase Program</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Several CFOs in recent years have implemented open market repurchases through an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. This allows them to repurchase the shares over time, but to obtain an immediate reduction in shares outstanding and a positive impact to earnings per share from the outset.</p>
<p class="para">In order to receive this accounting treatment, the CFO enters into a contractual commitment with an investment bank to repurchase a stated dollar amount of shares. This contract will commit the company to repurchase a specified number of shares at an estimated cost based on the current market value of the stock, with a “true up” at the end of the program to reflect the actual costs incurred in repurchasing the shares.</p>
<p class="para">The company's shares outstanding are reduced immediately to reflect the estimated shares to be repurchased and the true up is treated as an “option” that is settled through paid-in-capital, thus not impacting the income statement. However, if the true up is paid in shares, it will cause shares outstanding to increase at that time.</p>
<p class="para">The CFO manages an ASR program in the same manner as a conventional open market program, providing parameters to the investment bank concerning the timing of repurchases and the prices to be paid. However, the contractual commitment eliminates the company's flexibility to reduce or discontinue the program. In the event of financial duress, the CFO would have to arrange a separate transaction to reissue shares.</p>
<p class="para">An ASR program can be especially beneficial if a company seeks to offset the loss of earnings from a business that has been divested. Committing the divestiture proceeds to repurchases allows it to match the reduced shares outstanding against the loss of earnings, thus smoothing the impact on earnings per share. It is also a valuable technique in repurchasing shares issued in an acquisition, enabling the transaction to be more accretive or less dilutive from the outset.</p>
<p class="h2">Example of ASR Impact</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Let's assume that a company has net income of $100 in year 1, $110 in year 2, and $120 in year 3. If it repurchases 10 percent of its 100 shares outstanding, the impact on its earnings per share can be compared as follows:</p>
<p><img src="../OEBPS/images/c06tab1.jpg" alt="nc02f001.eps" width="631" height="152"/></p>
<p class="h1" id="c06-7">TENDER OFFERS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">If public companies pursue a one-time share repurchase, they typically execute the transaction through a tender offer at a fixed price or at a price that is set through a Dutch auction. In a Dutch auction, the company specifies a minimum and a maximum price and then all of the repurchases are made at the lowest price that achieves the targeted number of shares to be repurchased (subject to the minimum and maximum price).</p>
<p class="para">The advantage of a tender offer is that it allows a major repurchase to be executed relatively quickly, which reduces the market risk inherent in an open market program. However, it exposes the company to the risk that it is repurchasing all of the shares at an inopportune time—possibly at a market peak.</p>
<p class="para">Similar to an ASR program, a tender offer results in an immediate reduction in shares outstanding. Therefore, it is often used when a CFO seeks to offset the dilution from shares issued in an acquisition or to redeploy the proceeds from a major divestiture.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c06-8">RETAINING STRATEGIC CASH</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As an alternative to returning cash to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases, CFOs may prefer to retain a portion of their company's free cash flow either as a surplus cash balance or as unused credit lines. This provides more financial flexibility, allowing greater cash resources to be redeployed in the future.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs often refer to this as “strategic” cash to distinguish it from “operating” cash that is needed to run the business. Strategic cash can facilitate acquisitions or investments or can provide a buffer against uncertain economic or financial conditions. It is consistent with the maxim that “cash is king,” giving a company more strategic options.</p>
<p class="para">However, retaining strategic cash can be viewed unfavorably by investors, who may be concerned about undisciplined spending and the relatively low return on investment.</p>
<p class="h2">Facilitate Acquisitions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs are understandably reluctant to budget for unidentified acquisitions that may or may not be executed in the future. At the same time, they want to maintain flexibility concerning the timing and pricing of the potential transactions—thus allowing the company to be patient and opportunistic in its consideration of alternatives. Having cash on hand is the best insurance that CFOs will be able to respond with alacrity to opportunities and not be subject to the vagaries of the financial markets.</p>
<p class="para">Having ample financial resources can be a significant advantage in negotiations with the seller and can facilitate tactical responses in competition with other potential acquirers. Sellers usually want to be paid in cash, especially if they are marketing a business through a competitive auction. Long-term debt financing can be difficult to arrange quickly and bridge financing can be expensive.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, with a large cash balance, CFOs can avoid being reliant on stock or debt issuances to effect potential transactions; often the best acquisition opportunities become available during a market downturn, which very well may be an unfavorable time for the acquirer to issue stock or debt.</p>
<p class="h2">Facilitate Investments</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another argument for retaining cash is that it can finance major reinvestments in the business. If funding is not a constraint, a company may be motivated to develop additional business opportunities that will produce shareholder value.</p>
<p class="para">This argument especially applies to companies in capital intensive industries (e.g., energy or telecom) and to companies in research-intensive industries (e.g., high technology or pharmaceutical) that are investing in projects with uncertain long-range payoffs. No CFO wants lack of financial resources to be the constraint that frustrates attractive reinvestment projects.</p>
<p class="h2">Respond to Future Events</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A third argument for retaining surplus cash is that it provides more flexibility in an uncertain and volatile world. It provides protection against downsides—such as disruptive technologies, economic recessions, and market turmoil—but also offers the opportunity to capture upsides. For example, a market downturn is a great time to repurchase stock or to introduce new marketing campaigns against weakened competitors.</p>
<p class="para">In many ways, retaining cash is akin to an investment strategy where a portion of the portfolio is maintained in liquid investments, thus giving the CFO more diversification of financial resources and more flexibility to respond aggressively to future events.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, multinationals often retain much of their strategic cash in their international subsidiaries. This has tax advantages—avoiding the additional tax on repatriation—and provides flexibility to expand their international business with offshore funds.</p>
<p class="h2">Undisciplined Spending</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">While retaining strategic cash can be a cost-effective way to accommodate potential acquisitions, shareholders may be concerned that the money will not be spent wisely—particularly if the company does not have a track record of making value-enhancing acquisitions. They may fear that if funds are readily available, a company will become undisciplined in its approach to acquisitions—that the cash will “burn a hole in its pocket.” Investors usually prefer that any surplus cash be returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases—a “bird in the hand.”</p>
<p class="para">Unless a company is well-known as a superior acquirer—such as a private equity firm or a company with a documented track record of success—investors will be skeptical that it can redeploy the cash profitably. This skepticism applies equally to acquisitions and long-term investment programs.</p>
<p class="para">If a decision is made to retain surplus cash for strategic purposes, the CFO will need to provide frequent and convincing reassurances to investors that the company is committed to a disciplined approach to acquisitions and investments and that it will review any potential opportunities in comparison with the alternative uses of capital, including paying dividends to shareholders or repurchasing the company's stock.</p>
<p class="h2">Low Return on Investment</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A second argument against retaining surplus cash is that it produces a meager return on investment, especially in a low interest rate environment. Cash is typically invested in high-quality, short-term investments (such as Treasury notes or top-rated commercial paper)—assuring safety and liquidity, but producing a return that is far below the company's cost of capital.</p>
<p class="para">A few technology companies with very large cash portfolios—notably Microsoft and Google—have recently expanded their investments into new areas such as corporate debt, equities, and derivatives (including commodities). However, these strategies are very controversial, and some shareholders have been vocal in their opposition, advocating that the surplus cash be used instead for dividends or share repurchases.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c06-9">CASH INVESTMENT POLICIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Banks and other financial services companies are especially focused on maintaining appropriate investment policies, as are companies who manage customer funds in a fiduciary relationship. However, given the recent experiences in the financial crisis, it's safe to say that virtually all companies—including private companies, governments, and nonprofits—have reviewed and reinforced their investment policies.</p>
<p class="h2">Investment Policy Statement</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Every company should have a documented investment policy statement that is approved by the board of directors. The format and contents can vary, but it typically should include an overview of the company's cash management objectives, guidelines, and administration.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bolditalic">Objectives:</span> It should describe the cash portfolio, for example, whether it is divided into categories of cash (such as operating cash versus strategic cash) and who manages it—and specify the investment objectives (especially the tradeoff among yield, safety, and liquidity). It also should identify the benchmark for measuring performance (such as a market index).</li><li><span class="bolditalic">Guidelines:</span> It should set forth the guidelines for investing the cash—types of investments that are permissible, target maturities, limits against concentration of assets, and credit requirements (such as minimum debt ratings).</li><li><span class="bolditalic">Administration:</span> It should specify the administration of the portfolio—the custodian, the record keeping and compliance systems, the authorizations and controls, and any investment or other consultants that have been retained.</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Trends</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For the most part, companies have instituted conservative guidelines for investing their cash and their boards of directors continue to be risk averse. Generally, they prefer to sacrifice potentially higher returns for the additional safety of prudent investment strategies.</p>
<p class="para">The trends toward approving explicit investment policy statements and establishing conservative investment guidelines are widespread among companies, including nonprofits, but are especially pronounced among state and local governments. Several governmental units have posted their policy statements on the web.</p>
<p class="para">During times of market distress, CFOs will operate even more conservatively than the investment policies allow. For example, knowing the tendency of the rating agencies to lag actual events, they will more closely monitor their counterparty and credit risks and take anticipatory actions to limit their exposures.</p>
