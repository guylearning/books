<p class="chaptertitle">Achieving Finance Transformation</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">VERY FEW FINANCIAL ORGANIZATIONS have remained static during the past decade. Given the mounting financial and regulatory pressures, CFOs have responded with a series of initiatives to streamline their communications, standardize their processes, and enhance their analytical capabilities.</p>
<p class="para">Frequently, CFOs refer to their organizational aspirations as achieving “<span class="italic">finance</span> <span class="italic">transformation,</span>” a term that can have a generalized meaning, but typically and more specifically is associated with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revising the organizational structure</li><li>Implementing technology systems</li><li>Reengineering financial processes</li><li>Outsourcing financial functions</li><li>Emphasizing analysis versus data</li></ul>

<p class="h1" id="c23-1">ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The CFO's first objective in finance transformation typically is to revise the reporting relationships, creating more centralization and specialization among the financial functions. These changes can occur quickly—especially in response to severe cost pressures or control issues—but more likely will be implemented gradually, with incremental revisions over several years.</p>
<p class="h2">Traditional Structure</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In most large companies, the financial organizations traditionally have been organized according to business units. In this traditional structure, each business unit has a financial leader—typically with the title of division chief financial officer or division controller—who in turn has people reporting to him or her who are responsible for the various financial functions.</p>
<p class="para">For companies with international operations, the reporting structure usually has reflected a geographical focus as well, with a country serving either as the dominant organizational unit or as a secondary form of organization in a matrix arrangement with the lines of business.</p>
<p class="para">This traditional structure has the advantages of simplicity and consistency, with a series of decentralized financial organizations that are linked through a hierarchical chain of command. It also fosters close working relationships between the finance professionals and the business units.</p>
<p class="para">However, as companies have expanded their operations—moving into new business lines and expanding their global footprints—this decentralized form of organization has proven to be too costly. It is often associated with inflation of job titles, lack of specialization, and redundancies among activities and locations. Moreover, while a decentralized structure can help the finance professionals stay connected with the business, it can also result in sub-optimal controls and a loss of objectivity in financial reporting and analysis (“going native”).</p>
<p class="h2">Alternative Structure</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In response to the dual demands for stronger controls and lower costs, financial organizations generally have been evolving toward more centralization of activities and stronger reporting relationships. This trend toward greater centralization in the financial organization—both regionally and globally—first appeared for truly specialized functions (such as treasury and tax) and then became commonplace for operational activities (such as accounts payable, accounts receivable, and procurement), which were often organized as shared services.</p>
<p class="para">In recent years, this evolution toward more centralization and greater specialization has spread to the controllership functions—including an explicit separation of accounting and financial reporting from financial planning and analysis (FP&amp;A).</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>
</div>

<p class="featuretitle">Modern Organizational Structure</p>
<p class="featurepara">The modern organizational structure emphasizes more centralization and specialization in the reporting relationships than in the traditional structure. For example, the financial organization might be organized as shown in <a id="c23-f-1-1" href="#c23-f-1">Figure A</a>.</p><div class="figure">
<p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c23-f-1" href="#c23-f-1-1">Figure A</a></span> Modern Organizational Structure</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/c23f001.jpg" alt="c23f001.eps" width="451" height="502"/>
</div>
<div class="hr"><hr/>
</div>

</div>

<p class="para">In this alternative form of organization, the business unit controllers report directly to the corporate controller on a straight-line basis. However, they may continue to have a dotted line reporting relationship to their business unit—either a line of business or a country—and they may continue to be located physically in the field.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, the controllers often continue to be responsible for operational activities such as payables and receivables, although increasingly companies are housing these operational functions in a shared services organization, which may also include other functions such as procurement and facilities administration. These operational activities are normally clustered in centralized or regional locations.</p>
<p class="para">The FP&amp;A activities—which consist primarily of budgeting, forecasting, performance measuring, and business analysis—are separated from the controllership functions under a head of FP&amp;A, who normally reports directly to the CFO. Alternatively, the FP&amp;A people will continue to report to the business units, with dotted line reporting to the financial organization.</p>
<p class="para">Among the CFOs who have implemented this alternative structure, there is not a strong consensus concerning the reporting relationships for their FP&amp;A functions. Some CFOs advocate straight-line reporting throughout the financial organization, perhaps with dotted lines to the business units. Others prefer to maintain a predominantly business unit focus, usually with dotted line reporting to the financial organization. And still others conclude that a dual reporting structure is best, with shared responsibility between the business units and the financial organization, including shared responsibility for performance reviews and compensation decisions.</p>
<p class="para">Irrespective of the formal reporting arrangements, CFOs invariably will argue that they should have a strong say concerning the compensation decisions and career paths for the FP&amp;A professionals and that the FP&amp;A functions should maintain linkages with the rest of the financial organization.</p>
<p class="h2">Benefits of Reorganization</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As CFOs have gained experience with these alternative organizational structures, they have realized significant benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Lower Costs:</span> The alternative structures are inherently a more efficient form of organization for most companies, requiring fewer and often less expensive people. They can lead to fewer layers of management and more efficient flows of information.</li><li><span class="bold">Enhanced Controls:</span> A centralized controller organization facilitates the reengineering of accounting processes and fosters greater objectivity and consistency in accounting judgments. For this reason, audit committees typically prefer controllership functions that feature straight line reporting relationships to the CFO.</li><li><span class="bold">Differentiated Skills:</span> The revised organizational structure recognizes that the requisite skill sets for a controller position will vary from the skill sets for FP&amp;A and other financial positions. This can enhance the recruiting of highly qualified people to fill specific openings.</li><li><span class="bold">Analytical Capabilities:</span> The division of responsibilities makes it more likely that finance professionals can focus on analysis and value-added activities. The FP&amp;A skill sets typically are enhanced through the greater focus on business analysis.</li><li><span class="bold">More Standardization:</span> The centralized structure facilitates the adoption of consistent accounting procedures (such as the chart of accounts) and standardized performance measurements (such as the business unit financial reports and metrics). This promotes efficiencies and timely information flows.</li><li><span class="bold">New Technologies:</span> A global financial organization also makes it easier to implement new technology systems. More top-down direction and tighter reporting relationships can overcome some of the active or passive resistance that otherwise might frustrate major changes to existing processes.</li></ul>

<p class="para">The bottom line is that the reorganization of reporting relationships can be a significant step forward for the financial organization. The benefits are tangible and well worth the effort.</p>
<p class="h2">Obstacles to Reorganization</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given the potential benefits from a revised structure and the success that companies have achieved to date, why do all CFOs not adopt a centralized form of organization? The answer is that they usually need to overcome some obstacles, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Inertia:</span> Reorganizations are disruptive, and there never seems to be a good time to implement the changes, especially in light of competing priorities. CFOs need to drive the process and to take some risk.</li><li><span class="bold">Business Unit Resistance:</span> Many business leaders prefer to control all of their staff functions, including financial reporting. They may resist changes that will give them less autonomy over their financial statements and their people. This is especially true for their FP&amp;A professionals, who often serve as their trusted lieutenants in running the business.</li><li><span class="bold">Division Controller Resistance:</span> Division controllers often like to manage all of the financial functions for their business unit and do not want to choose between accounting and analysis, preferring to do both. Also, they may have concerns about their status (including their title), their level of compensation, and their future career path.</li><li><span class="bold">Insufficient Size:</span> Smaller companies or business units may not be able to realize the benefits from greater specialization. It may be more cost effective for finance professionals to perform multiple responsibilities.</li><li><span class="bold">Technology Limitations:</span> The ability to implement the changes may be impeded by limitations in the company's technology infrastructure. Consequently, the reorganization often must be accompanied by investments in new technology systems and tools.</li><li><span class="bold">Career Development:</span> The greater degree of specialization can make it harder to groom well-rounded financial leaders. The CFO's talent development programs need to explicitly address this challenge, employing development tools to broaden the skill sets of finance professionals.</li></ul>

<p class="para">The bottom line is that it is not easy to implement the organizational changes. CFOs need to communicate the benefits and solicit support for the transformation. They also need to proceed with deliberate speed, building on interim successes and quickly resolving issues that undoubtedly will surface along the way.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c23-2">TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A common lament among CFOs is that it is hard to get data in the form that they need it and that the financial organization is inordinately focused on producing data rather than providing business analysis. Finance transformation responds to this issue by upgrading and standardizing information technology systems.</p>
<p class="para">The good news is that technology providers have been developing sophisticated products to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of financial information systems. But the bad news is that implementing these technologies can be difficult.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, CFOs should follow some best practices that increase their odds of success in finance transformation. In particular, they should communicate a business plan and focus on project management.</p>
<p class="h2">Business Plan</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should communicate a clear <span class="italic">road map</span> for the scope of the project— including the time frame for its implementation and the benefits to be achieved—and set forth a realistic assessment of the financial and human resource  commitments that will be required. This will help get buy-ins from the CEO and business leaders, who can be indispensable allies in getting things done.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, they should set forth the goals for their financial information systems—articulating the end state that will define success. These <span class="italic">system requirements</span> typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A consistent chart of accounts.</li><li>A single general ledger system.</li><li>A comprehensive data warehouse.</li><li>Software for extracting and manipulating the data.</li><li>Automated electronic transfers of data and information.</li><li>Tools to facilitate consolidations of financial statements.</li></ul>

<p class="para">Finally, CFOs should estimate the annualized <span class="italic">cost savings</span> to be realized from the project. Much of the benefits of the transformation will be qualitative, but the technology investments also should produce some quantifiable savings, usually in the form of greater productivity and lower headcount. These savings can help sustain support for the project in the face of the challenges that inevitably will arise during implementation.</p>
<p class="h2">Project Management</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can also enhance the odds of success by focusing on proven project management strategies. These best practices include the following seven rules:</p><div class="list"><div class="item1"><span class="bold">Rule 1: Establish manageable goals.</span> Do not try to do everything at once, particularly if it expands the number of people who need to be coordinated. For example, CFOs may choose to implement one business division or one technology improvement at a time and to establish interim milestones.
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">Rule 2: Fix the underlying problems.</span> CFOs should not expect the technologies to fix underlying issues in their financial processes. Instead, the best practice is to fix the problems first (such as establishing common definitions for the chart of accounts) before implementing a new technology system.
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">Rule 3: Provide top-down leadership.</span> While consensus-building is normally a laudable goal, this kind of project needs firm direction to succeed, including the support of the business unit leaders who will benefit from the greater analytical capabilities that are made possible. It is absolutely critical for the CFO to provide strong top-down leadership.
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">Rule 4: Standardize; don't customize.</span> Instead of trying to replicate existing reports, the best practice is to settle on some standardized approaches that are used throughout the organization. Insisting on standardization is much more cost effective and can dramatically reduce the potential complications in implementation.
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">Rule 5: Make someone accountable.</span> Ideally, the project leader should know the financial organization, be adept with technology, and possess superb project management skills. It is important to appoint the best person available and to make it clear that he or she is in charge of the  project—with the CFO's unequivocal support!
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">Rule 6: Hire a consultant.</span> It helps to have people involved who have been through this process before. And consultants' specialized knowhow and technology expertise can be invaluable to project management. However, while the consultants can play a vital role, it is not their project: The accountability still lies with the CFO and the project manager.
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">Rule 7: Celebrate and reward success.</span> New and evolving technologies inevitably will be fundamental to maintaining a first-class financial system into the future. Therefore, CFOs should cultivate, recognize, and reward those people who demonstrate the ability to execute technology projects in a timely and effective manner; it's likely to be a valuable skill set that is coveted by financial organizations for the foreseeable future.

<p class="featuretitle">Reinventing the CFO</p>
<p class="featurepara">In his 2006 book <span class="italic">Reinventing the CFO: How Financial Managers Can Transform Their Roles and Add Greater Value</span> (Harvard Business Press, 2006), Jeremy Hope suggests ways to “liberate both finance and business managers from huge amounts of detail and the proliferation of complex systems that increase their workload and deny them time for reflection and analysis.”</p>
<p class="featurepara">Hope puts forth the following vision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce targets, measures, and controls.</li><li>Improve business analysis skills.</li><li>Enable local managers to respond to events.</li><li>Eliminate costs that add no value.</li><li>Measure to learn and improve.</li><li>Manage risk by raising competencies.</li></ul>
<div class="hr"><hr/>
</div>

</div>

<p class="h1" id="c23-3">PROCESS REENGINEERING</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A persistent theme is that CFOs are challenged to reduce the costs of their financial organizations, while at the same time continuing to maintain a high level of professionalism and service to their stakeholders. And to a very great extent, they have been succeeding: It is estimated that the financial headcounts have come down about 30 percent in the past decade.</p>
<p class="para">These cost reductions have not been easy, resulting in large part from the concerted efforts by CFOs to introduce more specialization, eliminate redundant activities, and achieve greater economies of scale.</p>
<p class="para">Without question, cost pressures will continue to be a fact of life for CFOs. As with most corporate functions, financial organizations will be expected to deliver continuous improvements and productivity gains. Moreover, because of their leadership role in managing the company's cost structure, CFOs will be expected to exemplify a cost consciousness that can be emulated throughout the company.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, like it or not, the CFO's playbook must include a relentless and never-ending focus on the reengineering of financial processes.</p>
<p class="h2">Set Aggressive Targets</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Although various benchmarking studies can provide some comparative data, it is hard to get true apples-to-apples comparisons for the overall costs of the financial functions. Companies can vary a great deal in their business mix, their geographical locations, and the functions that are included in the finance organization. For example, corporate development may be included in some organizations, but not in others. Furthermore, the treatment of payments to service providers—such as audit or banking fees—may not be consistently included or excluded by the companies in the survey.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, the benchmarking may not reflect differences in the quality of service provided by the financial organization. For example, a greater focus on business analysis can result in higher costs, but also increased profitability.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, while general benchmarking studies can broadly indicate an average level of spending—the general rule is that finance should be around 1 to 2 percent of revenue—it cannot provide a specific road map for managing the cost structure. A more fruitful approach is to look at benchmarking for specific financial functions—such as transaction processing or treasury functions—for similar companies in similar industries, but even here the information is likely to be directional and not dispositive.</p>
<p class="para">An alternative approach is to set aggressive targets against the company's baseline budget for the finance organization. The goal should be to achieve continuous savings, but to set the bar high enough so that it cannot be achieved without some radical improvements.</p>
<p class="para">If the CFO can get the finance organization's buy-in for ambitious objectives, then the financial leaders can focus intently on the action steps that are required, and worry less about the potential implications for their current status or career prospects. This approach has worked well in many financial organizations and is likely to be the best alternative for CFOs to pursue.</p>
<p class="h2">Introduce More Specialization</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The trend toward more centralized reporting relationships undoubtedly has helped financial organizations to achieve more specialization, which in turn has enhanced their level of expertise and knowhow. The need for increased specialization has been magnified by the seemingly endless proliferation and growing complexity of governmental regulations and financial reporting requirements; specialization has enabled CFOs to fulfill these added compliance responsibilities in a capable and efficient manner.</p>
<p class="para">As an acknowledged best practice, companies are centralizing both financial and operational activities within geographic regions or even at a single worldwide location. For example, a company might centralize all of its account reconciliations in one location, which can facilitate smooth communications and timely adjustments. Of course, specialization can deliver further savings if the activities are concentrated in a lower cost location.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, establishing centers of excellence also benefits a company's controls (e.g., by avoiding potential issues related to separation of duties in small operations). Moreover, the greater reliance on specialized expertise enhances the likelihood that a company will keep up-to-date concerning new regulatory requirements and will stay current with best practices in processes, methodologies, and technologies.</p>
<p class="h2">Eliminate Redundant Activities</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Establishing regional or centralized locations can also produce significant efficiencies through the elimination of redundant activities. The potential savings can be especially pronounced in the case of repetitive operations such as accounts payable, accounts receivable, and the administration of compensation and benefits plans. Although the relocation of functions can be disruptive—especially if much of the accumulated knowhow has not been documented—the potential benefits are usually well worth the hassles.</p>
<p class="para">In addition to the direct cost savings from the reduction of headcount, CFOs have often been able to achieve dramatic improvements from the adoption of best practices among the units that have been combined. Bringing the functions together makes it much more likely that these best practices will be embraced, especially if the operations are starting with a clean slate.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, documenting the procedures and practices can be a useful exercise in itself, helping to identify steps that can be eliminated and highlighting instances where employees are achieving results through heroic, but ultimately, inefficient “workarounds”—such as the use of offline spread sheets. Eliminating these workarounds will greatly enhance the integrity of the processes and pave the way for further automation and streamlining.</p>
<p class="h2">Achieve Economies of Scale</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The combination of activities in a centralized location can produce further benefits through greater economies of scale. For example, a consolidation of activities can lower the costs for facilities, technology tools, and administrative support. In addition, the larger scale can facilitate the assignment of activities to full-time specialists, who can work more efficiently than the part-time efforts of the people who were doing the activities previously.</p>
<p class="para">Even greater savings are usually possible if the financial operations are included within a broader shared services organization, especially if they are combined with other company-wide activities such as information technology, facilities management, and procurement. By elevating the status of shared services, companies can attract managers who have an aptitude for driving operational efficiencies and create a separate career track for people who have specific skills in shared services. Probably the biggest disadvantage with co-locating the shared service functions is the greater risk of a disruption due to a natural event (such as an earthquake or hurricane) or a labor issue (such as a slowdown or strike). Therefore, CFOs should consider the risk of potential business disruptions in deciding where to locate the shared services and ensure that they have back-up plans to mitigate the risks.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c23-4">OUTSOURCING ADVANTAGES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The use of outsourcing arrangements is another growing trend among modern finance organizations, although not without some controversy and risks. In many ways it is a natural outgrowth from finance transformation, as CFOs seek more specialization, centralization, and economies of scale throughout their financial organizations.</p>
<p class="para">Traditionally, CFOs have outsourced functions such as payroll, tax filings, internal audit, and collections. The unmistakable trend is now for CFOs to consider a much broader array of potential outsourcing arrangements, including core accounting and financial reporting activities and operational functions such as accounts receivable and accounts payable.</p>
<p class="h2">Lower Costs</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The cost advantages to be derived from outsourcing are well-documented at this stage. The arrangements usually reduce a company's all-in expense due primarily to lower labor costs, greater economies of scale, and perhaps a lower capital commitment.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs can achieve cost advantages from the service provider's greater level of expertise. In effect, the outsourcer can leverage the knowhow gained from its work with other companies and pass on some of the learning curve benefits from its accumulated experience.</p>
<p class="h2">Enhanced Quality</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Outsourcing can also result in improved quality, usually arising from the superior qualifications and training of the people involved. For example, an outsourcing firm in India can attract a well-educated and highly motivated work force. Furthermore, the outsourcing companies emphasize continuous learning in their specialized areas of expertise.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs can reinforce the focus on quality by establishing performance metrics that are defined precisely, documented thoroughly, and monitored regularly. When CFOs experience quality issues in outsourcing, it is usually due to improperly designed metrics or with a lack of clarity in the tasks to be performed. Therefore, CFOs who include outsourcing in their playbook should ensure that much careful thought goes into the “<span class="italic">statement of work</span>” that governs the outsourcing relationship.</p>
<p class="h2">Improved Controls</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For similar reasons, many CFOs also consider outsourcing to be a source of improved controls. A decision to outsource does not relieve a company from its responsibilities to maintain an effective control environment for the functions that are transferred. However, CFOs can take comfort from the outsourcing company's expertise, the quality of its people, the extensive documentation in its statement of work, and its intense focus on consistently delivering the performance metrics.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, each year the outsourcing company will provide a report pursuant to Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70 that confirms the effectiveness of its controls.</p>
<p class="h2">Greater Flexibility</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The transfer of work to a location in a different time zone can be advantageous if it facilitates continuous processing—often allowing a transfer of data back-and-forth between two or more distant locations. Combined with the efficiencies of broadband communications, the difference in time zones can reduce cycle times and allow more flexibility in meeting deadlines.</p>
<p class="para">Moreover, an outsourcing arrangement can also provide more flexibility in preparing for disaster recovery or other disruptions to the company's work flow—providing alternative locations where work can be accomplished. This is particularly true where the outsourcing company maintains back-up sites that can service several of its clients.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c23-5">OUTSOURCING IMPLEMENTATION</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Much of a CFO's success in outsourcing relates to the manner of its implementation. It is not without risk, and therefore CFOs should carefully review the best way to accomplish their outsourcing objectives. In particular, they should fix their problems first, take a gradual approach, review the tradeoffs in using an offshore provider, consider the potential ramifications to various stakeholders, and continue to evolve their outsourcing strategies.</p>
<p class="h2">Fixing Problems</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Probably the most common mistake in outsourcing is to transfer the operations before the problems are fixed—expecting the outsourcing provider to rectify the issues. Instead, the best practice is to identify the problems and then not to transfer the functions until the problems have been fixed or there is a well-defined road map for addressing them.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should view an outsourcing decision as a golden opportunity to review all of the processes and to determine what steps need to be improved and what steps can be eliminated. If CFOs need help in making these assessments, they can bring in people with specialized expertise, who typically are different people than the people who are adept in managing outsourced operations.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, many CFOs have learned—often the hard way—that they should not transfer the operations until they have fully documented all of the processes and have determined the performance metrics by which the operations will be managed. Otherwise, the statement of work will be unduly vague, which can lead to miscommunications and flawed execution.</p>
<p class="para">The outsourcing arrangements simply will not work properly unless the expectations are <span class="italic">reasonable</span> and <span class="italic">certain.</span></p>
<p class="h2">Gradual Approach</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs are also well-advised to move gradually toward the outsourcing of their financial functions. Usually, it is best to gain experience with outsourcing routine functions such as payroll and accounts payable, and then proceeding into more sophisticated functions such as accounting and financial reporting.</p>
<p class="para">Managing an outsourcing relationship requires different skills than managing operations directly. In particular, it takes a different style of communication, usually requiring more precision in the instructions and more clarity in the objectives that are sought. Therefore, before entrusting more extensive or higher value activities to the outsourcing provider, CFOs should ensure that their organizations have had sufficient experience in managing through performance metrics pursuant to a statement of work.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, because the outsourcing contracts typically extend over several years, a gradual approach allows the CFO to test the relationship before expanding the company's financial commitment. It is relatively easy to add new services to an existing relationship, while it is usually very difficult to unwind a relationship after the activities have been transferred.</p>
<p class="para">Consequently, CFOs should generally err on the side of caution, including an incremental approach to an expanded relationship.</p>
<p class="h2">Offshore Alternatives</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Many CFOs have had a positive experience in contracting with outsourcers who conduct their activities offshore. Such offshoring typically results in even greater cost savings than a domestic alternative due to cheaper labor and superior quality due to more specialized expertise. Also, they can offer economies of scale by co-locating several clients in the same vicinity.</p>
<p class="para">However, the vendor may be challenged to sustain these advantages as its labor markets become more competitive and its employee turnover escalates. For example, labor costs and turnover have been rising in Bangalore, India, where a number of outsourcing companies are located.</p>
<p class="para">As a general rule, CFOs are likely to have greater success in outsourcing if they are an important client of the vendor. If the vendor is allocating its best people, CFOs will want to be on its list of priority clients.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, communications can be a barrier. This certainly can apply to oral communications where language skills may be an issue. However, it can also be an issue in written instructions, which need to be extremely precise to avoid the risk of miscommunications. This is why the vendor normally will house a number of people at the client's place of business—who serve as intermediaries in communications with their colleagues at the offshore location.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, it should be noted that it can be difficult for CFOs to manage activities that are being conducted in a distant, remote location, especially if travel arrangements are limited. This can make it hard to maintain a hands-on understanding of potential problems that may be percolating. Also, travel can represent a significant cost of outsourcing, both the out-of-pocket transportation expense and the opportunity costs of management's time.</p>
<p class="h2">Stakeholder Relations</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should be sensitive to the potential impact of outsourcing on the company's relations with its stakeholders, including governments, communities, customers, and employees. This is especially true when the activities are being transferred to an offshore location.</p>
<p class="para">Given high levels of unemployment, communities and customers may react negatively to an offshoring decision, perhaps damaging the company's image and its reputation for corporate responsibility. And depending upon its business and customer mix, the public's reaction can have a discernible impact on the company's revenue and business results, especially if it markets its products or services to governments and their agencies.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, the decision to outsource—either a domestic or an offshore alternative—can have a negative impact on employee morale, causing the people not directly affected to feel less secure about their own status. Therefore, it is very important for CFOs to be extremely transparent with employees, letting them know as soon as an outsourcing decision is made and providing candid descriptions of the future plans to the extent that they are known. They should not be learning of decisions through the grapevine.</p>
<p class="para">Employees can handle the truth; it is uncertainty that they find most vexing. They will appreciate being kept informed and being treated with trust and respect.</p>
<p class="h2">Evolving Strategies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Without question, CFOs will continue to pursue outsourcing as a fundamental way of doing business in an increasingly global environment. The question usually is not whether to outsource, but how much and with whom? However, given the potential issues involved—especially in a decision to use an offshore provider—it is also likely that most CFOs will be gradually evolving their outsourcing strategies over time.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, the pros and cons of outsourcing are likely to be continuously in flux. Because the technology, labor, and political environments remain very fluid across the globe, a strategy that makes sense today may not make sense tomorrow.</p>
<p class="para">For example, the locations for outsourcing may need to shift with the changing labor markets; today's low-cost location may be uncompetitive tomorrow—making it desirable to engage in a continuous migration to the next frontier of service providers. And a change in tax rules could make a difference in a comparison between locations.</p>
<p class="para">The bottom line is that CFOs need to emphasize continuous improvements in their outsourced functions and to remain flexibly adaptive to changes in the environment.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c23-6">ANALYSIS VERSUS DATA</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given the escalating demands for financial organizations to produce frequent and detailed financial reports, there is a natural tendency for finance professionals to become overly preoccupied with process and to focus on data rather than analysis. This is particularly true if, like most companies, their methods of generating data are cumbersome and time-consuming. The financial organization can become numb due to the constant need to produce data on a tight time schedule and too accepting of their limitations in providing financial analysis.</p>
<p class="para">A focus on data rather than analysis was confirmed by an APQC study that found that 47 percent of financial analysts' time was spent on collecting and validating data; 30 percent on administering the process; and only 23 percent on providing value-adding analysis. Certainly, this is not the ideal allocation of time and CFOs are constantly seeking ways to tilt the balance toward value-adding activities.</p>
<p class="para">Finance transformation can be a partial antidote to this dilemma, with its changes—reorganization of reporting relationships, investments in technology, and reengineering of processes—all intended to free up resources for higher value activities. However, the solution also lies with finance professionals who possess superb analytical skills and a passion for solving business problems.</p>
<p class="para">In leading their financial organizations, CFOs should continuously reinforce the message that budgets, forecasts, and reports are simply tools in managing a company's performance and not ends in themselves. Their mandate is to facilitate timely and effective responses to business issues that are identified through a systematic and thoughtful communication of pertinent financial information.</p>
<p class="para">They should also focus resources on higher value tasks, and accelerate the evolution toward finance professionals who are business partners. They should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate reports and processes that are no longer necessary or that have lower value compared with business analysis.</li><li>Emphasize analytical and communication skills in staffing the financial organization, seeking people who can produce impactful analyses.</li><li>Align objectives and rewards among finance professionals to reflect impact rather than process.</li></ul>

<p class="para">This requires a financial organization that is more adaptive and more focused. In other words, less is more.</p>
