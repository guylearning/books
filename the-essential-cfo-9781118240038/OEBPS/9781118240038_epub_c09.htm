<p class="chaptertitle">Executing a Merger or Acquisition</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">WHEN A COMPANY IS READY TO pursue a potential merger or acquisition, the CFO usually partners with the business sponsor and general counsel in leading a deal team that conducts due diligence, prepares a business plan, establishes the pricing parameters, negotiates the contract terms, and integrates the acquired company.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, the CFO actively coordinates all of the various parties involved in a transaction, both the internal management and the external advisors, who can include investment bankers, lawyers, accountants, tax specialists, consultants, and other participants at various stages of the transaction. This coordination can contribute to a smooth and error-free execution, and can increase the likelihood that the transaction will fulfill the company's business and financial objectives.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c09-1">DUE DILIGENCE</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">After entering into discussions concerning a transaction—either through one-on-one negotiations or as part of a competitive auction—the deal team will conduct a thorough due diligence review of the acquisition candidate. To the extent possible, this will include a relatively constant group of staff people who work on all of the acquirer's transactions and who can apply consistent procedures in ensuring that all the bases are covered.</p>
<p class="h2">Negotiated Transactions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Due diligence is best accomplished through a methodical, painstaking approach that involves substantial requests for information to be provided by the target. This is one of the reasons that acquirers normally prefer negotiated transactions with a willing seller. If they can reach a meeting of the minds about the desirability of a deal, both parties can invest the substantial time and energy to do a proper review of all the considerations involved—making it more likely that the integration will go smoothly and that neither side will be surprised or disappointed.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, if the acquirer is a strategic competitor, the acquisition candidate may feel more comfortable sharing confidential or sensitive information about its products, customers, and other aspects of its business when it is likely to lead to a combination than when it is part of a competitive process with an uncertain ending. In an auction, the seller often fears that a strategic acquirer is simply on a “fishing expedition.”</p>
<p class="h2">Competitive Transactions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">An auction typically involves simultaneous discussions with several potential acquirers through most of a two-stage process—a “preliminary indication of interest” and then a “final bid”—usually with relatively standardized information provided to the auction participants through a data room—which today is typically provided in electronic form—and through well-orchestrated management presentations.</p>
<p class="para">Potential acquirers can submit requests for additional information or for answers to specific questions, but the target's management team is usually stretched due to their need to be responsive to several potential buyers at the same time. Also, the seller does not want to give any impression that there is not a level playing field among the auction participants.</p>
<p class="para">It is only after the auction process has been narrowed to one or a few participants that the acquirer can ascertain some of the most valuable information—such as customer lists or pricing strategies. And because the auction normally imposes strict time constraints, the acquirer can find it challenging to perform a thorough review in the allotted window of opportunity. Moreover, this final phase of an auction is usually termed “<span class="italic">confirmatory</span>” due diligence, which makes it difficult for the acquirer to expand its scope too aggressively.</p>
<p class="h2">Responses to Auction Limitations</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given the stark contrast between negotiated and competitive deal environments, CFOs should take some action steps to increase their odds of success. First, they should seek to pursue negotiated transactions whenever possible—perhaps making a preemptive bid that is contingent upon the seller agreeing to exclusive negotiations. The CFO can argue that a negotiated transaction will be quicker and more certain than an auction, which may be attractive to the target, especially if the acquirer can offer an attractive price that does not include a financing contingency.</p>
<p class="para">Second, CFOs should seek to limit the number of auctions in which the acquirer participates, thus avoiding some of the strain on the company's scarce business and staff resources. Participating in auctions has opportunity costs that should only be incurred if the CFO believes there is a reasonably good probability that a transaction will be consummated. Like most things, acquisitions benefit from greater focus.</p>
<p class="para">Third, CFOs should seek to overcome the inherent limitations to conducting due diligence in a competitive auction. For example, they can:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="italic">Leverage external information sources</span>—such as bankers, consultants, accountants, and the Internet—to learn as much as possible about the target (but remaining compliant with the nondisclosure agreement).</li><li><span class="italic">Organize a swat team</span> for conducting confirmatory due diligence if the company reaches the final stage of the process (accomplishing as much as possible in a limited amount of time).</li><li><span class="italic">Include</span> <span class="italic">representations and warranties</span> in the contract (marking up the seller's contract that is submitted with the final bid).</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Due Diligence Checklist</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Plenty of checklists are available and the mergers and acquisitions specialists within law firms can provide state-of-the-art itemizations of the various areas that need to be covered in a due diligence review. However, CFOs should recognize that while generic checklists can be terrific blueprints—especially for the legal and financial items that need to be covered—they should be supplemented with tailored procedures that reflect the acquirer's specific business and strategic objectives.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should also take pains to ensure that the due diligence process does not devolve into a rote, “check-the-box” type of exercise. Instead, the primary focus should be on issues that can determine a deal's success or subject the acquirer to material financial, operational, legal, or reputational risks.</p>
<p class="para">Establishing continuity in the due diligence team can go a long way toward obtaining the right level of focus; working with a detailed checklist, an experienced deal team can leverage their accumulated expertise and direct their energies toward the issues of most concern.</p>
<p class="h2">Due Diligence Team</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Due diligence teams historically have been dominated by financial and legal people, with a primary focus on verifying the assets and liabilities, reviewing the legal and governance documents, and discovering any liabilities or other exposures that are not currently shown in the financial statements. These objectives remain central to the due diligence efforts.</p>
<p class="para">However, much of today's focus is on <span class="italic">business due diligence,</span> especially learning information about the target that can form the basis for a business plan to integrate the companies effectively and to realize the projected synergies from the transaction. The team should not hesitate to request relatively detailed and sensitive information from the target, including answers that may require opinions and interpretations—and not just data—about customers, competitors, products, and markets, as well as strategies for addressing long-term challenges in the business. The target may resist some of these requests, but they are critical to confirming that the acquisition will indeed make business sense.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, there is greater focus on human resource considerations—such as the compatibility of the <span class="italic">compensation and benefits programs.</span> The danger is that conforming to the acquirer's programs can make the target's cost structure uncompetitive; however, maintaining separate programs can create administrative costs and headaches, especially if the nonconforming programs continue to proliferate.</p>
<p class="para">Acquirers are also more focused on the <span class="italic">compatibility of the cultures,</span> which frequently can make or break a successful integration. The horror stories of incompatible cultures are legion—providing cautionary tales for all acquirers and their CFOs.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Technology</span> is another area of increased concern, especially when it is fundamental to the target's business model. Incompatible systems can be a deal killer, as can the need for significant investments to bring the target's infrastructure up to the acquirer's standards. These can be issues that fester if not addressed immediately in the integration plan.</p>
<p class="para">It is also important to review the target's support systems, including the compatibility of <span class="italic">financial reporting</span> technologies. The proliferation of general ledgers is something to avoid.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, due diligence teams often involve a broad and expanding group of <span class="italic">specialists</span> who can lend their expertise to the review. For example, human resource specialists may asses the capabilities and potential of the target's management team—helping to determine whether they can play a leadership role in the combined company going forward. Other specialty areas may include accounting procedures (including a review of the target's Sarbanes-Oxley compliance), environmental issues, litigation exposures, tax planning, or regulatory compliance.</p>
<p class="h2">Sharing Conclusions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Once the team members have completed their reviews, they should share their conclusions with the rest of the due diligence team and prepare a summary report for the business sponsor—along with any suggestions for strategies to mitigate the issues that have been identified.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should appreciate that the goal of due diligence is not to produce a riskless transaction, but to foster a common understanding of the relevant facts and to ensure that the acquirer's decision-makers are made aware of all the material risks and opportunities—which then can be considered in negotiating the deal terms and ultimately in deciding whether to proceed with the transaction. It is one thing not to know about the issues, but it is another thing if the acquirer can accept the issues with eyes wide open.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c09-2">BUSINESS PLAN</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Preparing a detailed business plan is the cornerstone of a successful transaction—the work product that largely determines the target's valuation and dictates the plan for its integration. The plan is shaped by the information gleaned through due diligence and should manifest the acquirer's strategic and business objectives.</p>
<p class="para">While the CFO can provide active support to the business plan's preparation, it is critically important that the business sponsor takes the lead in its development and assumes personal responsibility for its implementation—including the financial projections. To that end, the CFO should strive to reinforce the business sponsor's “ownership” of the transaction.</p>
<p class="para">The business plan should be as detailed as possible, with specific target dates and explicit accountabilities for:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="italic">Communicating with stakeholders,</span> including employees, customers, vendors, and regulatory authorities.</li><li><span class="italic">Realizing cost and other synergies,</span> including an itemization of the planned headcount reductions.</li><li><span class="italic">Integrating infrastructure functions,</span> including IT systems, payroll, benefits administration, telecommunications, and email.</li><li><span class="italic">Achieving business milestones,</span> including the proposed actions with respect to brand names, sales reorganizations, and leadership roles.</li></ul>

<p class="para">In each case, the CFO should confirm that designated individuals will be accountable for completing each of the action steps in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c09-3">FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Of course, the business plan should also include detailed financial projections—typically three to five years—that will serve not only as the yardstick for measuring the transaction's performance, but also as guideposts for determining the target's valuation and the price to be offered. The goal should be to produce aggressive, yet realistic projections—similar to the company's methodologies for preparing its long-term financial model.</p>
<p class="para">In addition to the overlay of projected synergies, the target's historical and projected financial statements should reflect the allocations and accounting treatments that will apply after the acquisition. Some typical examples include applying purchase accounting adjustments for intangibles and goodwill, excluding non-recurring items, consolidating tax returns, reflecting revised compensation arrangements, allocating overhead expense, and using constant currencies.</p>
<p class="h2">Intangibles</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">If the acquirer is paying more than the target's book value, the assets will be written up to their fair value, including the value of intangible assets such as customer lists, brand names, patents, and technology systems. These intangibles will be amortized over their estimated useful life, which means that the acquirer will need to have relatively definitive plans for their use.</p>
<p class="para">For example, the value of a brand name can have a perpetual life—and thus not be amortized. However, if the acquirer plans to phase the brand name out over time, the amortization will reflect this shorter life.</p>
<p class="h2">Goodwill</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As the residual from all of the purchase accounting adjustments, the transaction is likely to show a goodwill asset on the balance sheet. Although not amortized, the goodwill is subject to the risk of a future write-off if its value diminishes. Therefore, CFOs will want to understand this risk and to consider if there are any mitigation strategies to consider.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, the goodwill is usually tax deductible in an asset deal. This should be included in the cash flow projections, but it will not affect net income.</p>
<p class="h2">Non-Recurring Items</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs may choose to exclude certain non-recurring revenue or expenses from the pro forma financials—both historical results and future projections. For example, they may exclude a positive or negative legal or insurance settlement or a special bonus related to the transaction.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs typically exclude some deal-related expenses from the business plan projections. For example, they usually exclude expenses—such as investment banking and legal fees—that are not intrinsic to the business.</p>
<p class="h2">Tax Status</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">If the acquisition involves a U.S. private company, it may be organized as an S corporation, where the shareholders are taxed as individuals or a partnership. The financials will need to be adjusted to include a corporate tax expense, reflecting the conversion of the target to a C corporation, which will be included in the acquirer's consolidated tax return.</p>
<p class="h2">Compensation Arrangements</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">If the target is closely held, it may be paying compensation to the owners that will not be continued after the acquisition. The financial statements should be restated to reflect the anticipated compensation arrangements going forward.</p>
<p class="h2">Overhead Charges</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should adjust the financials to reflect the allocated and direct overhead expenses that will be borne by the target after the transaction is consummated. They can either include only the acquirer's incremental expenses (which is the best approach in valuing the target) or they can include the fully allocated costs (which is likely the way that the target will be charged going forward).</p>
<p class="h2">Constant Currencies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In preparing the pro forma financials, CFOs may choose to adjust the target's historical results to reflect constant foreign exchange rates for its international operations. This can facilitate comparisons of the target's historical and forecasted results.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c09-4">FINANCING PLAN</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given the fundamental corporate finance principle that separates investment decisions from financing decisions, the CFO's valuation of an acquisition candidate should be largely agnostic to the way that transaction is to be financed. However, the expected financing plan will influence the pro forma analyses, which in turn may affect the acquirer's stock price reaction. Therefore, when evaluating a potential transaction, the CFO will need to reflect the likely financing arrangements in some of the analyses.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, arranging financing is a critical part of executing the transaction. The CFO should develop a short- and long-term financing plan, understand the likely costs, estimate the impact on the company's financial projections, determine whether an offer to the target should include a financing condition, and ensure that the acquisition will not cause the company to violate its debt covenants.</p>
<p class="h2">Cash versus Equity</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The CFO's first decision is to determine whether the transaction will be paid totally in cash, totally in equity, or through a combination of the two. In most cases, CFOs will prefer to pay cash: It's easier for the seller to value, and it is usually favored by the target's shareholders. In addition, it is typically favored by the acquirer's shareholders, who prefer not to be diluted. And if an acquirer is listed on a U.S. stock exchange, it must receive shareholder approval to issue more than 20 percent of shares outstanding.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, there are good reasons why a CFO may decide to issue equity—usually in the form of common stock, but sometimes as a convertible preferred. First, the acquirer may not be able to retain its debt ratings unless it includes equity in the consideration. Second, the seller may prefer equity to facilitate a tax-free transaction for its shareholders. Third, the seller may desire to share in the perceived upside in the acquirer's stock due to the perceived benefits that will accrue from the transaction or due to a perception that the acquirer's stock may be undervalued.</p>
<p class="para">The issuance of equity is often associated with consolidation transactions, especially in connection with a merger of equals. Equity also is more likely to be used in a negotiated transaction than in an auction process; in an auction, the seller typically prefers the certainty and speed of execution of cash. Nevertheless, equity is occasionally used in competitive auctions, usually if it allows the seller to obtain a higher value. For example, Capital One offered common stock to win a competitive auction for ING's online banking platform, giving ING a 10 percent ownership stake and a board seat.</p>
<p class="h2">Short-Term Financing</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The CFO's second decision is to determine how the transaction will be financed over the short term. Because the target typically wants to close the transaction quickly and not be subject to a financing contingency, CFOs normally will pay for the acquisition out of surplus cash balances or by tapping existing lines of credit. However, if they do not have sufficient funds available, they may need to arrange short-term bank loans, with the expectation that they will refinance the funding subsequent to closing.</p>
<p class="para">For major transactions, CFOs may obtain “bridge” financing, usually from the banks that are serving as financial advisors for the transaction. The ability of major banks to provide this one-stop shopping has become an important consideration in CFOs' evaluation of their financial advisory relationships.</p>
<p class="h2">Long-Term Financing</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The CFO's final decision is to determine the long-term financing for the transaction. If stock has been issued to satisfy the seller's desire for  a tax-free transaction, the acquirer often will repurchase part or all of the shares in the open market, thus eliminating the dilution from the original issuance. To fund this repurchase, the CFO may need to arrange additional long-term debt financing.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs will usually issue long-term debt or equity to refinance any short-term financing issued in the transaction. To some extent, the nature of this refinancing may reflect the assets and financial characteristics of the target's business. However, unless the acquisition has caused a material change in the acquirer's overall portfolio, the refinancing plan will largely reflect the CFO's overall objectives with respect to the company's long-term capital structure.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c09-5">PRICE NEGOTIATIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Although the business sponsor should be the decision maker concerning the price to be paid, the CFO can influence the negotiations, helping to ensure pricing discipline and realistic determinations of value.</p>
<p class="h2">Point of Indifference</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The valuation analyses performed by the acquirer are essential to confirming that the proposed transaction will create shareholder value and establishing the parameters for the price that will be offered. In particular, the CFO should develop a clear-eyed appraisal of the maximum price to be paid.</p>
<p class="para">Especially in the case of a competitive auction, it is important to define in advance this “<span class="italic">point of</span> <span class="italic">indifference</span>” where the transaction no longer makes sense. Otherwise, it is too easy to get swept up by the deal fever that is aroused by the competitive process.</p>
<p class="h2">Board Authorization</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The board of directors can help enforce pricing discipline. The CFO usually will prepare a decision memorandum or presentation for the board of directors (usually with a prior review by the finance, audit, or executive committee) that contains the background for the transaction; the strategic rationale; the business plan; the financing arrangements; and the various financial analyses, including the valuation analyses and the pro forma impact of the proposed transaction on the acquirer's financial statements.</p>
<p class="para">Because the board members typically have not been intimately involved in the negotiations, they can provide objective feedback not only about whether the transaction makes sense, but also the maximum price that should be authorized. Furthermore, by requiring the company to seek additional approval to raise its offer above the authorized amount, the board is establishing a last line of defense that can help avoid a non-economic transaction. While this approval process gives management less flexibility in responding to fluid deal dynamics, it is a tradeoff that usually pays off over the long run.</p>
<p class="h2">Earnouts</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Earnouts are often used to bridge a gap between the seller's expectations and the price that the acquirer is willing to pay. However, while earnouts can be an elegant solution in some cases—especially when the target will be run separately and the acquirer wants to retain the management team—they can also create problems in the future.</p>
<p class="para">First, they can retard the speed of integration, making it harder to realize cost synergies. Second, they can lead to disputes over accounting allocations. Third, since the adoption of FAS 141R, contingent consideration is subject to fair value accounting, which creates potential volatility to earnings during the earnout period.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, CFOs should be wary of their use, try to limit their life, and not let them represent too much of the purchase price (around 10 to 20 percent is a good guidepost for their maximum amount).</p>
<p class="h2">Flexibility to Walk Away</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">It is also important that the acquirer not be wedded to a specific transaction. Similar to the real estate admonition “don't fall in love with the house,” if the acquirer is too strongly committed to a specific acquisition candidate, it is very susceptible to overpaying—often under the guise that the target's “<span class="italic">scarcity value</span>” justifies a higher premium. While paying an extraordinary premium for scarcity value may be valid in rare situations, CFOs should be wary that it's not sophistry—usually advanced by investment bankers to rationalize a higher price than warranted by the valuation analysis.</p>
<p class="para">Because transactions typically involve a substantial investment of time and emotion, it's often very hard to walk away from a deal. Therefore, CFOs should serve as a modulating force, helping to preserve the company's ability to say “no,” especially in response to competitive offers or unreasonable demands. Saying no is certainly better than experiencing buyer's remorse after the deal fever subsides.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c09-6">CONTRACT TERMS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Partnering with the general counsel, the CFO usually plays an active role in negotiating the deal terms—making sure that all of the key issues are considered and providing input with respect to the liability exposures, the contingency arrangements, and the employee agreements.</p>
<p class="h2">Liability Exposures</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The CFO should seek to limit the acquirer's exposure to liabilities subsequent to the transaction. Constructing the transaction as an acquisition of assets rather than the stock of the target company can be a significant advantage, as it generally limits much of the liability exposure that otherwise would be attendant to the acquisition. However, in many instances, a stock transaction is the only alternative that is possible.</p>
<p class="para">The acquirer can also obtain protections through the representations and warranties provided by the seller—usually through defined procedures for compensating the acquirer for breaches of these assurances. However, they are usually subject to a maximum amount, and, as a practical matter, it may be difficult to collect these reimbursements if the business is acquired from individuals who don't have deep pockets. Furthermore, it is generally impossible to negotiate any post-closing remedies when acquiring the stock of a publicly held company.</p>
<p class="para">The CFO's best protection against liability exposures is maintaining the flexibility to say “no” to the deal. If a transaction is going to expose the acquirer to unacceptable risks, then it is probably better to walk away, especially if the company has alternatives for fulfilling its strategic objectives. This is particularly true of certain risks—such as environmental or consumer safety concerns—that can tarnish a company's reputation as well as expose it to monetary penalties.</p>
<p class="h2">Contingency Arrangements</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another key part of the contract is the set of conditions and contingencies that can cause the deal to be abandoned by either party. Although the possibility of unforeseen events may not be top-of-mind in the discussions between the principals, it is enormously important to think through these arrangements carefully in advance. Some of the key questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Deadline:</span> How much time do the parties have to consummate the transaction (the <span class="italic">“</span>drop dead” date)?</li><li><span class="bold">Regulatory Approvals:</span> What happens if the transaction fails to obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals (e.g., will the acquirer need to compensate the target through a breakup fee)?</li><li><span class="bold">Material Adverse Change:</span> What happens if there is a significant deterioration in the target's business?</li><li><span class="bold">Force Majeure:</span> What are the contingencies for major events (such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks or hostilities, or financial market shutdowns) that may occur before closing?</li><li><span class="bold">Customer Approvals:</span> Will the customers need to agree to the transaction and what are the price adjustments or other remedies if some of them fail to agree?</li><li><span class="bold">Financing Condition:</span> Is the transaction subject to a condition that the acquirer can obtain financing (which is an especially important consideration in the case of a highly leveraged structure)?</li><li><span class="bold">Stock Price Adjustments:</span> If common stock is being paid by the acquirer, will there be a “collar<span class="italic">”</span> concerning either the maximum and minimum stock price or the maximum and minimum number of shares, and are there stock price levels where either party can walk away from the deal?</li><li><span class="bold">Alternative Acquirer:</span> Can the seller continue to shop the business to other potential acquirers and does it owe a breakup fee if the business is sold to an alternative acquirer?</li></ul>

<p class="para">As the contract is being negotiated, it can be tempting for CFOs not to focus on these contingencies, which can seem like remote possibilities. However, as a prudent application of Murphy's Law, it is better to assume that what can go wrong, will go wrong.</p>
<p class="h2">Employee Agreements</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The parties also will specify the acquirer's obligations to the target's employees. For example, they will compare the salaries and benefits, including healthcare, with their current compensation. If the target's employees will have less favorable arrangements with their new employer, it is usually desirable to communicate these changes up front, avoiding disappointments or misunderstandings after the acquisition is completed.</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, because employee turnover usually increases after closing—both voluntary and involuntary turnover—the agreement should clarify the acquirer's obligations to pay severance or provide career counseling. For example, the acquirer's commitment to pay severance often is based on a “double trigger” that applies if an employee is involuntarily or “constructively” terminated by the acquirer within a specified time frame (typically six months to two years).</p>
<p class="para">If certain employees are considered essential to the acquirer's business plan, the transaction may be subject to them signing employment contracts, including a non-compete provision for a specified period of time (typically six months to three years). In addition, these key employees often will receive bonus incentives that are tied to their continued service.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c09-7">ACQUISITION INTEGRATION</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Of all the steps in an acquisition that can go wrong, integration is probably the one that is most underestimated. To paraphrase a tired cliché, “the devil is in the integration details.” Integration skills are often the telltale indicators of companies who successfully execute their acquisition strategies versus acquirers with a propensity to destroy shareholder value.</p>
<p class="para">For example, GE Capital has been known to be an acquirer with superior capabilities in executing transactions. A <span class="italic">Harvard Business Review</span> article attributed GE Capital's ability to integrate acquisitions to four principles that can be paraphrased as follows:<a id="c09-not-0001-1" href="#c09-not-0001"><span class="superscript">1</span></a></p><div class="list"><div class="item1">1. Acquisition integration is a process that begins with due diligence.
</div>
<div class="item1">2. Integration management is a full-time job.
</div>
<div class="item1">3. Decisions should be made and implemented as soon as possible.
</div>
<div class="item1">4. Integration should meld not only the business operations, but also the  cultures.
</div>

</div>

<p class="h2">Business Plan Reviews</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should employ the business plan as the primary tool for evaluating a transaction's performance. To that end, CFOs usually institute a regular process for reviewing the progress of the acquisition's actual results against the business plan's expectations—with a focus on completing the integration milestones, delivering the forecasted synergies, achieving the projected financial results, and documenting any lessons learned that can affect the acquirer's approach to future transactions.</p>
<p class="para">Companies usually conduct these reviews quite frequently during the first year after a transaction is consummated and gradually reduce their frequency thereafter. These reviews are critical to creating a culture of excellence in executing acquisitions, providing the foundation for future value-enhancing transactions.</p>
<p class="h2">Business Sponsor Involvement</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The business sponsor's hands-on involvement is absolutely critical to the successful execution of an acquisition. This applies not only to realizing the business and financial objectives, but also to performing the seemingly mundane tasks of integrating all of the various back office functions that affect the day-to-day activities of employees—including their ability to get things done in their new environment.</p>
<p class="para">In particular, the business sponsor can make a real difference in talent retention, which is often a challenge in the wake of an acquisition. By establishing a good working relationship with the target's management team, the business sponsor can smooth their assimilation into the acquirer's culture and facilitate their adaptation to unfamiliar operating and administrative procedures.</p>
<p class="h2">Gatekeeper</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Most acquirers find it desirable to establish a gatekeeper for accessing the target after a transaction is announced, with clear ground rules concerning the scope and frequency of visits and information requests. Otherwise, the target's employees can be overwhelmed by a deluge of visits and requests from the acquirer's well-meaning staff people, including members of the CFO's financial organization.</p>
<p class="para">Above all, the acquirer should do everything possible to ease the on boarding of new employees; to eliminate any obstacles to a smooth integration; and to focus resolutely on achieving the acquisition's strategic, business, and financial objectives.</p>
<p class="h2">Post-Closing Adjustments</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Finally, the CFO should establish rigorous processes for determining the post-closing “true ups”—adjustments to the purchase price that reflect updated financial statements and any indemnities that arise from the representations and warranties. For example, the price in private transactions is often adjusted for the amount of working capital on the target's balance sheet or the seller may need to indemnify the acquirer for an environmental or other type of liability.</p>
<p class="para">The procedures for these adjustments will be spelled out in the sale agreement, including “holdbacks” of a portion of the purchase price, minimum and maximum amounts for the adjustments, deductibles against potential claims, and “flyspecks” that establish a minimum amount for each issue that is raised. The agreement also will include time limits to raise issues, which can create some urgency for the acquirer to complete its post-closing reviews.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs can realize material savings by approaching these adjustments seriously—ensuring that the reconciliations are conducted thoroughly and accurately and often enlisting the help of an outside accounting firm with expertise in this type of analysis.</p>
