<p class="chaptertitle">Chapter Two</p>
<p class="chaptertitle">Communicating and Achieving Alignment</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL BENEFITS OF A well-articulated strategic plan is that it can foster alignment among the company's investors, board of directors, chief executive officer (CEO), management team, and employees: It's a great way to get everyone singing from the same hymnal.</p>
<p class="para">The strategic plan also provides milestones through which the CFO and the financial organization can monitor, measure, and evaluate the company's financial performance and forms the basis for the company's incentive compensation programs. CFOs can add considerable value in the design and implementation of the compensation programs, which are powerful tools in driving performance.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs today typically play an indispensable role in interfacing with the investment community and a growing role with the financial media. Given the powerful developments in communications technology and the explosion of both traditional and online sources of information, it's more important than ever that companies project consistent messaging to the external world, especially with respect to their business and financial strategies. The CFO's playbook should emphasize this priority.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-1">CONSISTENCY AND TRANSPARENCY</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can play an integral role in achieving alignment, emphasizing consistency and transparency in the company's messaging—all the time reinforcing a focus on the strategic plan's business and financial objectives.</p>
<p class="h2">Consistent Communications</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The strategic plan should be described consistently in all strategic communications, although the degree of specificity will vary depending on the audience and the type of communication (e.g., a regulatory filing, a press release, a media interview, an investor conference, or a town hall meeting). The general counsel typically will also review presentation materials to ensure that the company doesn't inadvertently violate a securities regulation.</p>
<p class="para">In addition to consistency, CFOs should emphasize <span class="italic">repetition</span> in their communications. By repeating key message points, they can reinforce the company's commitment to its business and financial objectives and achieve greater alignment throughout the company and with external constituencies.</p>
<p class="h2">Transparent Communications</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The investment community is looking for greater transparency concerning a company's strategic objectives, as well the metrics and sensitivities that will drive the company's performance. Therefore, CFOs are trending toward providing more information with respect to the key variables that will create or destroy shareholder value.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should evaluate what metrics to disclose regularly to investors, either in connection with their quarterly results or through a separate communication, including posting the results on the company's website. It is one of the best ways to achieve greater appreciation for the relationship between the company's near-term performance and its long-term strategic objectives.</p>
<p class="para"> It can also be argued that greater transparency will enhance shareholder value; investors abhor uncertainty and may ascribe a higher valuation to a stock if they believe management is being open and candid with them. Therefore, although some information may be sensitive in light of competitor or customer concerns, CFOs generally should be biased toward transparency—withholding information only if they have good reason to believe that the potential downsides of disclosure will outweigh the potential benefits.</p>
<p class="h2">Stakeholder Communications</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs generally have broadened and escalated their communications efforts in recent years, not only with investors, but also with other external and internal constituencies. For example, they often meet with customers, vendors, and government officials to describe their companies' strategic objectives and to provide perspectives concerning their historical financial results and expectations for the future. Furthermore, they meet regularly with bankers and the rating agencies; make frequent presentations to the board of directors and board committees; and speak regularly to management and employee groups.</p>
<p class="para">The challenge for CFOs is not only to maintain consistency in their communications across the various constituencies, but also to cater their presentations for the specific audience that is being addressed—striking the right balance to inform and motivate. Recruiters at search firms confirm that these communication skills are becoming increasingly important in evaluating CFO candidates.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-2">INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Incentive compensation programs are especially important tools in achieving alignment around the strategic plan objectives. As a result, many CFOs are involved with establishing the criteria for these programs; it is integral to their playbook for delivering shareholder value.</p>
<p class="para">While the chief human resource officer usually provides the primary staff support for the compensation committee of the board of directors, CFOs can play a role in recommending the metrics used for determining bonuses and other incentive compensation, establishing the definitions for these metrics, calculating the performance against these metrics, and providing input concerning the type of compensation that is paid. They can also help assess whether the compensation programs will incentivize behaviors and actions to achieve the company's strategic objectives.</p>
<p class="h2">Incentive Compensation Metrics</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should provide input into the frameworks for the compensation programs. These frameworks usually reflect a mix of criteria that are either quantitative or qualitative and that are judged either according to a formula or left to the committee's discretion.</p>
<p class="para">The discretionary portion of the framework can reflect the “degree of difficulty” in achieving the targets. For example, economic conditions may have improved or grown worse since setting the financial targets. They can also accommodate judgments concerning qualitative objectives that don't lend themselves to formulaic determinations.</p>
<p class="para">An example of a hypothetical framework might be expressed in the following three-by-two matrix:</p>
<table class="bodytable" border="1">
<tbody><tr><td> </td><td class="headercell">Formulaic</td><td class="headercell">Discretionary</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Financial Metrics:</td><td class="bodycell">50%</td><td class="bodycell">20%</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Non-Financial Metrics:</td><td class="bodycell">20%</td><td class="bodycell">—</td></tr><tr><td class="bodycell">Qualitative Objectives:</td><td class="bodycell">—</td><td class="bodycell">10%</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p class="para">CFOs can express views concerning the metrics to be included, as well as the percentage breakdown among quantifiable financial metrics (e.g., earnings per share); quantifiable non-financial metrics (e.g., customer satisfaction surveys); and qualitative objectives (e.g., implementation of a management development program). They can also recommend relative weightings for the criteria—especially the percentage breakdown between financial and non-financial metrics—as well as the amount of discretion that can be applied.</p>
<p class="para">The criteria and their weightings should reinforce the strategic plan, including the business and financial objectives.</p>
<p class="h2">Absolute versus Relative Performance</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another key decision is whether the financial metrics should be evaluated on an absolute or relative basis. For example, if total shareholder return is to be a key performance measure, how should it be evaluated?</p>
<ul>
<li>As an <span class="italic">absolute target</span> (say, 2 percent)?</li><li>In comparison with a <span class="italic">market index</span>?</li><li>In comparison with an industry <span class="italic">peer group</span>?</li><li>Or as a <span class="italic">combination</span> of an absolute target, with a market index or industry peer group modifier?</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Range of Possible Outcomes</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs also can offer their perspectives concerning the ranges for the performance metrics—such as the minimum threshold to receive a bonus and the upper target to earn the maximum bonus. Also, should the range be symmetric or asymmetric from the target? For example, it may make sense to have a wider range for the upside potential and a narrower range for the downside risk.</p>
<p class="para">By analyzing the company's historical data and performing sensitivity analyses, CFOs can help the compensation committee arrive at a sound judgment concerning the best way to structure the incentive payments for a range of possible outcomes.</p>
<p class="h2">Metric Definitions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should ensure that the definitions of the performance metrics are consistently applied and that they reinforce the strategic plan. For example, they should consider questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Capital Charge:</span> Should a capital charge be applied to the financial results? </li><li><span class="bold">Currencies:</span> Should non-U.S. operations be evaluated using local currency, budgeted exchange rates, or actual exchange rates?</li><li><span class="bold">Restructurings:</span> Should the costs and benefits of restructuring programs be included in the financial results?</li><li><span class="bold">Pension Funds:</span> Should the financial targets include the incremental costs of defined benefit plans due to changes in stock market values and interest rate levels?</li><li><span class="bold">Non-recurring Items:</span> Should the results include one-time benefits or costs such as a large investment gain or a litigation settlement?</li><li><span class="bold">Strategic Transactions:</span> Should the results include the costs and benefits of incremental acquisitions and divestitures?</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Compensation Mix</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs may also want to express a point of view concerning the proportion of incentive compensation relative to salaries. For example, they may recommend a higher percentage of variable compensation as a way to gain more consistency in the company's financial results or to lessen its vulnerability to economic cycles.</p>
<p class="para">As another example, CFOs may advocate restricted stock versus stock options if the company is paying a rich dividend and emphasizing the stability and predictability of its results. In contrast, stock options (or stock appreciation rights) may be more appropriate if the company is pursuing a high growth strategy in a relatively risky or volatile industry.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-3">INVESTOR ALIGNMENT</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given their dual responsibilities in strategy and investor relations, CFOs are uniquely positioned to help achieve investor alignment around the strategic plan objectives. As much as possible, they should emphasize transparency in their communications of the company's strategic and financial objectives and the metrics that are used in the company's incentive compensation programs.</p>
<p class="para">At the same time, they should <span class="italic">manage expectations.</span> It is critically important that CFOs establish credibility with investors and cultivate a reputation for delivering on their promises. The commonly expressed goal is to <span class="italic">underpromise</span> and <span class="italic">overdeliver</span>.</p>
<p class="para">As a result, CFOs will always face a delicate balance between their desire to communicate openly about the company's objectives and their need to set realistic expectations about what can be accomplished within a given time frame.</p>
<p class="h2">Compensation Metrics</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In particular, investors are increasingly focused on the metrics that drive incentive compensation programs—often considering them to be crucial in their decisions whether to own a stock. This focus has been heightened by the enhanced disclosures in proxy statements, particularly the relatively new requirement to provide a compensation discussion and analysis (CD&amp;A).</p>
<p class="para">The disclosures concerning incentive compensation can be a source of tension with shareholders; companies often prefer not to provide the specifics of their compensation metrics due to competitive concerns, while investors want to know the agreed-upon formulas that are incentivizing management. Furthermore, boards of directors often do not want to be constrained by a strictly formulaic approach to their compensation decisions—preferring to preserve some flexibility to account for the business environment and competitive conditions—while investors often desire certainty, especially in cases where the company has underperformed in the past.</p>
<p class="para">Given the differing approaches to compensation, CFOs should be prepared to describe to investors not only the facts concerning their company's incentive compensation program, but also the compensation committee's rationale in designing and disclosing the management incentive metrics.</p>
<p class="h2">Form of Consideration</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In addition, investors often have strong views concerning the form of consideration provided to management. For example, they may prefer that management receive equity securities rather than cash—thus giving management more “skin in the game.” Or they may prefer that a company issue restricted stock rather than options so as to expose management to the same downside risks as investors and to eliminate a potential disincentive for increasing dividends on the stock (due to the negative impact on the Black-Scholes valuation of options).</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, CFOs should evaluate whether the mix of consideration in the incentive compensation programs is consistent with the company's strategies and its target shareholders. If not, they may want to express this point of view to the compensation committee.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-4">ANALYST RELATIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Analyst relations are at the heart of investor communications and central to the CFO's goal of achieving alignment. Between earnings announcements, public companies generally try to maintain an active dialogue with both sell side and buy side financial analysts, although subject to the “Fair Disclosure” restrictions (which prohibit selective disclosure of material information).<a id="c2-not-1-1" href="#c2-not-1"><span class="superscript">1</span></a> This dialogue typically begins in the immediate aftermath of the earnings call, when the company's investor relations professionals will answer detailed questions from the analysts to clarify the points made on the call.</p>
<p class="para">Typically, most of the analysts' questions relate to their earnings models, which are updated to reflect the new information that has been communicated by the company. The sell side analysts usually will publish research notes that summarize the messages conveyed by the company on the earnings call, give some commentary about their reaction to the earnings announcement, and provide any updates with respect to their investment ratings on the company or their stock price expectations going forward.</p>
<p class="para">Because of the significant decline in the number of sell side analysts during the past decade, as well as the sizable increase in the number of companies that each analyst covers, CFOs have become less reliant on sell side analysts to communicate their company's story to investors. The analysts simply do not have the bandwidth to fulfill this mission in today's financial environment. Therefore, maintaining sell side relations is a necessary, but not sufficient, strategy for keeping investors informed.</p>
<p class="para">In response, CFOs and their investor relations teams are placing greater emphasis on communicating directly with current and prospective investors—focusing on both buy side analysts and institutional portfolio managers. This is a trend that has been underway for several years and shows no signs of abating. For CFOs, it means being readily accessible to investors and recognizing that every interaction is important given the relatively close-knit investment community; major investors often will share their impressions with each other and the media.</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>
</div>

<p class="featuretitle">Sell Side versus Buy Side Analysts</p>
<p class="featurepara">Sell side analysts are employed by brokerage firms to communicate with investors concerning an industry and companies within that industry. They typically will provide some fundamental research on the industry, maintain earnings models, and publish projections for earnings per share and other key financial data. They also will rate the company's stock (along the lines of a buy, sell, or hold recommendation) and usually provide a stock price target (the expected price within twelve months).</p>
<p class="featurepara">They formerly were closely identified with investment banking and played active roles in soliciting and executing equity financings. However, as a result of the reforms instigated by then New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer in 2002, they now are separated from underwriting activities and are expected to generate revenue from trading commissions and fees paid by investors to the brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="featurepara">Buy side analysts, in contrast, are employed by institutional investors (such as investment managers, mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds) to analyze industries and companies and to recommend investments (either purchases or short sales) to the portfolio managers or other decision-makers. They do not publish their research and their investment ideas are considered proprietary.</p><div class="hr"><hr/>
</div>

</div>

<p class="h2">Industry Analysts</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In addition to their relations with financial analysts, CFOs also may help to cultivate the relations with industry analysts who form opinions concerning a company's business strategies and product lines. They include industry experts and consultants who provide proprietary commentary on industry developments. These thought leaders are especially prominent in high technology industries, where a number of well-known firms can exert significant influence among customers and investors.</p>
<p class="para">At a minimum, CFOs should be aware of the analysts' opinions and should be alerted to any significant commentaries—both favorable and unfavorable—that may be forthcoming. This early warning allows CFOs to consider the potential impact on the company's financial results and the likely reaction among investors.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, CFOs should make sure that any information provided to industry analysts is consistent with that provided to the investment community. And they may want to be actively involved in presentations to the analysts. For example, they can help to communicate the company's acquisition strategies or provide updates concerning the company's financial condition and its performance metrics.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-5">INVESTOR PRESENTATIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs usually play a primary role in coordinating the priorities and content of investor presentations, which can include investor conferences, group meetings, investor days, and road shows. In addition, they often make the presentations.</p>
<p class="h2">Investor Conferences</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The most common way to foster direct communications with investors is to make presentations at conferences that are sponsored by brokerage firms, often hosted by a sell side analyst who covers the company. The number of conferences that companies attend can vary a great deal, but around three or four a year is probably the norm. Usually the presentations are made by the CEO or CFO, although chief operating officers or business leaders can also be featured at these conferences.</p>
<p class="para">Participating in investor conferences can offer several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Broad Dissemination:</span> The formal presentation is webcast, thus enabling the communication of new information without running afoul of the Fair Disclosure restrictions. This represents an effective way to highlight recent developments and gives more prominence to the communications than the alternative of issuing a press release.</li><li><span class="bold">Small Group Meetings:</span> The firm sponsoring the conference usually will arrange several small group or one-on-one meetings with investors. This is a highly efficient way to have intimate conversations with investors without the need to travel among dispersed locations.</li><li><span class="bold">Competitor Presentations:</span> The conferences typically feature presentations by competitors or by companies with similar investor profiles, thus providing a window into their current status and positioning with the investment community.</li><li><span class="bold">Investor Feedback:</span> They afford a chance to learn what is on investors' minds. Listening to their points of view can be of tremendous help in calibrating the company's messaging or even refining its financial strategies.</li></ul>

<p class="para">CFOs often use their presentations at investor conferences as an opportunity to educate analysts concerning their <span class="italic">earnings model</span>. This education can go a long way toward establishing effective communications with the financial community, especially when there are significant and rapid changes in business or economic conditions. If analysts and investors have a thorough comprehension of the earnings model, it is much easier for them to understand how changes in the macroeconomic environment likely will affect the company's results—thus reducing the possibility of negative surprises.</p>
<p class="para">Most CFOs believe that participating in selected conferences is a worthwhile investment of their time and a superb opportunity to stay current with both equity and debt investors. However, they also recognize that the presentations can require considerable advance preparation and that they are generally most effective when the company has some new information to convey.</p>
<p class="h2">Group Meetings</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another common practice is to meet informally with a group of investors who have been convened by a sell side analyst, typically over a breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The usual format is for the CEO or CFO to make brief remarks and then to entertain questions and answers. The investors usually like to hear what's on the minds of other investors, which makes the Q&amp;A format especially popular.</p>
<p class="para">Unlike the investor conferences hosted by brokerage firms, these informal meetings are not webcast and thus are subject to the Fair Disclosure constraints. Nevertheless, they can provide an excellent opportunity for a constructive dialogue with investors, helping to clarify and reinforce the messages that have been previously delivered and giving the company's management a chance to hear directly from investors about their expectations and concerns.</p>
<p class="h2">Investor Day</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Many CFOs have found it valuable to host an investor day, which is an opportunity to showcase the management team and to provide updates concerning the company's strategic objectives. Typically, these are half-day events that are simultaneously broadcast over the web.</p>
<p class="para">In contrast to investor conferences, an investor day is sponsored by the company itself rather than by a brokerage firm; the company is the sole attraction—which has the advantage of gaining investors' undivided attention for the presentations and question-and-answer sessions. In addition, it can be an effective vehicle for exposing investors to the company's product offerings, including new product launches.</p>
<p class="para">Some companies schedule an annual investor day that is held around the same time each year, often based on their planning cycle. This has the advantage of predictability and avoids raising expectations that an important announcement will be made.</p>
<p class="para">The other approach is to host an investor day from time to time, usually when there is something new to report to investors. This helps the company deliver rich content, but may lead to disappointment if investors have high expectations for a dramatic announcement of some sort. Also, the scheduling of this kind of event can lead to anticipatory market activity in the company's stock and options, which can affect the way that the company's messaging is received, especially if the company is not making a major announcement.</p>
<p class="para">As a general rule, investor days are generally well-received by shareholders and can facilitate a more in-depth understanding of the company's strategic objectives—including the financial performance that it expects to achieve over the long run and the sensitivities of its performance to exogenous factors and company-specific growth drivers. If done well, they also can relieve some of the pressure to meet quarterly expectations, with investors able to take a longer-term view with respect to the company's financial performance.</p>
<p class="h2">Road Shows</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">From time to time, companies will visit one or more cities for a series of one-on-one meetings and usually one or two group meetings. Although more time consuming than an investor conference, the visits to the investors' places of business can facilitate the attendance by portfolio managers, as well as buy side analysts, and can give the CFO a good feel for the various objectives and concerns among the decision-makers at significant institutions. The cities typically visited can range from U.S. locations such as New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Minneapolis, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Philadelphia, or Baltimore or non-U.S. locations such as London, Edinburgh, Frankfurt, Paris, Milan, Tokyo, Hong Kong, or Shanghai.</p>
<p class="para">The format typically comprises some brief remarks by the CEO or CFO, followed by questions and answers, although if it's a first-time meeting with the institution, presentation materials may be used to provide an overview of the company. These meetings are subject to the Fair Disclosure constraints. Often a road show is arranged in connection with a securities offering, which adds another layer of legal constraints concerning the information that can be conveyed by the company.</p>
<p class="para">Companies often ask sell side analysts to sponsor these visits. It is a way for CFOs to recognize the contributions of the brokerage firm analysts in communicating the company's messages to investors. Furthermore, the brokerage firms have the knowhow for arranging these visits, including taking care of the logistics (which can be especially valuable in an unfamiliar city). Most important, their salespeople will follow up with the investors subsequent to the meetings.</p>
<p class="para">Some institutions will permit the sell side analysts to attend the meetings, but increasingly they are excluding the analysts from their one-on-one sessions with management. However, the analysts usually will attend the group meetings and will accompany the company's management in traveling to and from the various institutions. The analysts frequently will write a report subsequent to their trip, which means that the company's management should consider their conversations with the analyst to be “on the record” and subject to the Fair Disclosure rule.</p>
<p class="para">The institutions to be visited usually will be a combination of existing and prospective shareholders. The sell side analysts typically will determine the itinerary, which sometimes can create a conflict with the company's investor relations objectives. For example, the analysts often will want to include hedge fund investors—who are responsible for much of the brokerage firms' trading volumes—while companies may prefer that the visits be focused on longer-term investors. Therefore, it is important that CFOs work closely with the analysts in arranging the visits so as not to have miscommunications and disappointments in their itinerary.</p>
<p class="para">In the case of a securities offering, the lead underwriters will arrange the road show, including the recommendations of cities and institutions to visit. They also will coordinate the follow-ups to “indications of interest” by the institutions that are visited.</p>
<p class="h2">Virtual Road Shows</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Despite the giant strides in communication technologies, most road shows are still done in person and investment banks generally will advocate that physical travel is necessary, especially in connection with initial public offerings or other issuances of securities. They argue that investors want to get a good feeling for the company's management, which is difficult to accomplish over the phone or through a screen.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, there has been some movement toward conducting virtual road shows from remote locations and, given the rapid advances in communication technologies, it would seem inevitable that we will be seeing more virtual road shows in the future.</p>
<p class="para">For example, one technique is to have a conference call where the company communicates prepared remarks around a series of slides that are posted on the web. Then, similar to an earnings call, the management team answers questions from the group. Subsequent to this general presentation, the company then holds a series of one-on-one conference calls or video meetings with selected institutions.</p>
<p class="h2">Major Announcements</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Companies usually will arrange a special communications program for major announcements, such as a merger or a significant acquisition or divestiture. Often working with a public relations firm that specializes in strategic communications, companies will typically engineer a multifaceted program consisting of a press release, a webcast presentation, several investor meetings or calls, and media interviews—all well-coordinated around targeted message points.</p>
<p class="para">These communication programs can be extremely important to investors' perceptions of major events, often determining whether an announcement is well-received and the initial impact on the company's stock price. Consequently, it is vitally important that in preparing for the announcement, CFOs have anticipated the potential questions from investors and the media, and to the extent possible, have crafted answers that can be communicated clearly and concisely to a relatively broad audience.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-6">COMPANY WEBSITE</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">All of the company's financial communications come together on the website, which has become the bedrock of effective investor communications. It provides one-stop convenience for investors, allowing them to obtain Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, earnings press releases, earnings and other conference calls, investor presentations, webcasts, and other essential information about a company. Websites are especially important vehicles for communicating with individual investors, who appreciate the breadth of information.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs typically use third-party services to help develop and maintain their investor relations websites, with considerable focus on the design of the home page. However, the technology and best practices are evolving quite rapidly, which means that CFOs should ensure that their practices are staying up-to-date. Also, to the extent that they can add features such as answers to frequently asked questions, the website can free up investor relations people to focus on higher value added activities.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-7">SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">To date, CFOs generally have not actively embraced social media in their investor communications strategies and investor relations professionals have been wary concerning their potential use. Encouraging visits to the company's website continues to be the primary focus of their electronic communications with investors.</p>
<p class="para">This reluctance to utilize social media at least partly reflects the potential legal ramifications. The SEC has made it clear that all communications made by, or on behalf of, the company are subject to securities laws. Furthermore, the SEC has admonished companies to establish controls and procedures and to monitor all of the company's activities on the web. Thus, even if companies are not proactively using social media in their investor relations strategies, their general counsels will need to stay abreast of actions by the marketing departments or other areas that may be accessing these outlets.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs will want to stay current concerning the use of social media by investors to communicate with each other. For example, a posting by an individual in a blog or on a chat board—irrespective of whether the information is true or false—can trigger a rumor and cause volatility in the company's stock price.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, shareholders may use social media to organize their efforts to propose a strategic action by the company or to effect a change in its governance—which could have serious consequences to the company if it allows them to gain proxy access or otherwise advance their agenda. This is a trend worth watching, especially when combined with other changes in the corporate governance landscape.</p>
<p class="para">The bottom line is that the use of social media—as well as the Internet in general—is likely to have far-reaching implications for investor communication strategies in the future. CFOs—as well as CEOs, general counsels, and board members—will need to stay abreast of these developments to maximize their positive impact, but also to safeguard against their potential to do harm.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-8">MEDIA RELATIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Most companies believe that it is advantageous to have their CFOs play an active role in media relations, which is a prime example of how the CFO's playbook is expanding. And it seems reasonable to assume that this responsibility will continue to grow in importance, indicating additional skill sets that will be desirable—or, more likely, essential—for the CFOs of the  future.</p>
<p class="h2">Integral to Investor Relations</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">With the growth of financial media beyond the traditional print sources—including specialist broadcast networks like CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg, as well as financially oriented websites like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Motley Fool, Seeking Alpha, and The Street—more investors are obtaining information from third-party sources than previously. The lines between media and investor communications are continuing to blur, with investors obtaining information from the various media outlets and with the media following market developments with more intensity.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, CFOs should ensure that the media relations strategies are synchronized with the investor relations strategies—helping to accomplish their common objectives—and should consider their involvement in media relations as integral to their investor relations efforts.</p>
<p class="h2">Substitute for CEO</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In most cases, the media would prefer to interact with the CEO. However, it is virtually impossible for the CEO to satisfy all of the requests due to conflicting demands on his or her time. The CFO typically is considered a credible substitute for the CEO, capable of discussing the company's strategies and financial objectives and of representing the company with a broad audience. In addition, CFOs can be a desirable subject for an interview due to their particular expertise with respect to strategic or financial topics.</p>
<p class="para">In light of the increased skepticism about corporate financial statements and the public's heightened interest concerning corporate investment plans—especially why they are not reinvesting in more job-creating projects—CFOs can be desirable public relations representatives. Next to the CEO, the CFO is usually the best alternative to serve as the public face for the company—capable of addressing questions concerning the company's policies and plans.</p>
<p class="h2">Need for Immediate Responses</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given the fast pace of the 24/7 news cycle, the corporate communications group often needs to provide an immediate response to a media inquiry, possibly relating to activity in the company's stock price or to rumors concerning its financial results. CFOs are often in the best position to provide this response, which can make a big difference in ensuring that the company's point of view is represented from the outset.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-9">POTENTIAL MEDIA PITFALLS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Nevertheless, although CFOs are increasingly expected to add value through their active participation in media relations, they should be wary of the downside risks in playing this role.</p>
<p class="h2">SEC Restrictions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For public company CFOs, anything that they say to the media is subject to the anti-fraud provisions under the securities laws. Therefore, it is important that CFOs stick to messages that are consistent with the company's communications strategies—as would be the case for an investor presentation. Moreover, depending upon the publication or news outlet, the CFO must be careful not to violate the Fair Disclosure rule. This could occur if a statement is not deemed to be broadly disseminated through the media—such as a specialist blog or website—and is considered material information provided to a select group of potential investors.</p>
<p class="h2">Marketing Coordination</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Comments to the media are likely to be heard or read by customers; therefore, anything that the CFO says about products or services should be consistent with the company's marketing communications. In particular, CFOs should be careful in discussing product launch dates or sales expectations—which could upstage the marketing plans.</p>
<p class="h2">Stakeholder Concerns</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Even with the proper caveats, a CFO's comments may upset a stakeholder group who may translate the comment more strongly than intended or take it out of context. For example, if a CFO says that a plant shutdown or additional outsourcing could be a potential cost reduction strategy, this might prematurely or unnecessarily alarm employees or communities about the possible impact to them.</p>
<p class="h2">Predictions of the Future</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Because there usually is a delay between an interview and the publication of an article or the airing of a feature, the CFO's comments about the future may seem out of touch in light of intervening events—an especially acute risk due to the volatile and unpredictable financial environment in recent years. As Yogi Berra said, “It's hard to make predictions, especially about the future.”</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-10">COORDINATING COMMUNICATIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">To maximize the benefits and to ameliorate the potential downsides, CFOs should work closely with their company's public relations and corporate communications people and any media advisors. They can help to screen and prioritize interviews, establish appropriate ground rules, and accompany the CFO to any interviews or appearances.</p>
<p class="para">In some cases, it may be helpful to establish a direct or dotted line reporting relationship between corporate communications and the CFO. However, regardless of the reporting structure, it is important for the CFO to forge a close working relationship between the finance organization and the people who communicate regularly with the media.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-11">INTERVIEW FORMATS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Some interview formats have more risks for CFOs than other formats. For example, a live broadcast interview is more controllable than one that is edited. And if ground rules are established for the interview—such as a prior review of facts and quotes before they are published—that can be a good check against wrong information or erroneous transcriptions, although it usually won't allow the CFO to retract a quote unless the journalist agrees. Also, a “deep background” interview that doesn't mention the CFO by name is certainly less risky than going on the record in a documented conversation.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, the type of publication or broadcast outlet can make a real difference. For example, specialist publications such as finance magazines tend to be more favorable to the CFO than national publications, which may have a less balanced agenda. The simple fact is that a journalist can make CFOs look bad, no matter how much they stay on message.</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>

<p class="para">In addition, it certainly helps to know the track record of the journalist or, even better, to have dealt with him or her in the past. The best defense against an unbalanced interview is to deal with a journalist with a reputation for integrity and fairness.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, CFOs will want to be sure that they are comfortable with the subject matter, especially if it's on a technical subject—like an accounting standard or a technology strategy—where the interview is likely to get into details.</p>
<p class="para">The main point is that CFOs should be circumspect about granting a interview, making sure that it is likely to result in a story that advances the company's overall communications and media relations strategies, as well as enhancing its brand image with investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders. When in doubt, don't do it.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-12">MEDIA TRAINING</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As CFOs become more involved in their company's media relations, they are well advised to undergo some media training. Either in-house or external experts can help CFOs to achieve impactful interviews and avoid some common pitfalls. For example, media training can provide helpful tips such as the suggestions described below.</p>
<p class="h2">Stick to Message Points</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Although politicians are often ridiculed for their slavish devotion to prepackaged messages, there is wisdom in their goal of answering the questions that they want to answer rather than necessarily the ones that they are asked. Message points also can help to prevent rambling or to avoid drifting into unfamiliar or dangerous territory.</p>
<p class="h2">Do Not Repeat a Leading Question</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Media training can sensitize the CFO to journalist techniques such as the “have you stopped beating your wife” type of question. For example, if a journalist asks “Are you cooking the books?” and you reply, “We are not cooking the books,” you are apt to see a headline like the following: “CFO Says that Company XYZ is Not Cooking the Books.”</p>
<p class="h2">Avoid Extraneous Subjects</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A journalist may ask you about a current event that essentially amounts to a political question. Unless the CFO can resist the temptation to offer a personal opinion, he or she may inadvertently embroil the company in a controversial topic and risk alienating a segment of the company's customer or employee base. It is usually better to avoid extraneous subjects at all times, but especially when they have not been considered in advance.</p>
<p class="h2">Keep It Simple</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The audience for a media interview is usually less sophisticated about financial matters than an investor group. Therefore, CFOs should avoid using acronyms or jargon and try to communicate in a manner that is clear, concise, and easily understood. The goal is not to sound smart—it is to communicate the company's message points in a way that connects with the audience.</p>
<p class="h2">Be Self-Confident</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">If nothing else, media training will bolster CFOs' self-confidence and sense of being in control. This will increase the probability that their involvement in media relations will be a positive experience for both them and their company.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c02-13">NOTE</p>
<p class="endnoteentry"><a id="c2-not-1" href="#c2-not-1-1">1.</a> The Securities and Exchange Commission adopted the Fair Disclosure regulation (Regulation FD) on August 15, 2000 to “address the selective disclosure of information by publicly traded companies and other issuers.” The rule provides that “when an issuer discloses material nonpublic information to certain individuals or entities—generally, securities market professionals, such as stock analysts, or holders of the issuer's securities who may well trade on the basis of the information—the issuer must make public disclosure of that information.” <span class="inlineurl"><a href="http://www.sec.gov/answers/regfd.htm">http://www.sec.gov/answers/regfd.htm</a></span>.</p>
