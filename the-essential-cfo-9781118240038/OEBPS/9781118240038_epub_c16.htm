<p class="chaptertitle">Chapter Sixteen</p>
<p class="chaptertitle">Driving Business Performance</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs ARE PLAYING EXPANDED ROLES in driving business performance. Not content with being the scorekeeper, they are actively partnering with the CEO and business leaders in generating organic revenue growth and managing the company's cost structure.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c16-1">ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As any CFO can attest, it is much easier to increase profitability if a company is growing its revenue. If dealing with a stagnant or declining revenue base, CFOs start each year with the challenge of reducing costs just to stay even with the prior year. It is a treadmill that becomes almost impossible to sustain, especially when the ability to shrink headcount is constrained by costly severance payments.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, contrary to their out-of-date image as impediments to growth, today's CFOs are focused as much on the revenue side as the expense side of the income statement. Indeed, several recent surveys have identified “<span class="italic">generating revenue growth</span>” as their number one priority in the current environment.</p>
<p class="para">This does not mean that CFOs should embrace growth strategies that are undisciplined or unprofitable; however, it does recognize that the question is not whether to grow, but <span class="italic">how to</span> <span class="italic">grow,</span> and that the CFO should foster growth initiatives that are meaningful, profitable, cost-effective, and consistent with the company's risk parameters.</p>
<p class="para">They can pursue a number of potential strategies to achieve this goal, including prioritization of focus, use of financial tools, partnering with the business leaders, and interactions with customers.</p>
<p class="h2">Prioritization</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can help prioritize the growth strategies, concentrating in areas that match the company's core competencies and historical track record. They can increase the probability of success by focusing the company on what it does best.</p>
<p class="para">Through their leadership roles in strategy, capital allocation, and mergers and acquisitions, CFOs can direct resources to the product lines and geographies where the growth potential is highest—both in the size of the revenue opportunity and the expected return on investment—and discourage efforts that are either too small to move the needle or not sufficiently profitable to justify the management focus. In other words, <span class="italic">accomplishing more by doing less</span>.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs can also help to determine whether an organic growth strategy can be augmented or replaced by the targeted acquisition of a technology, infrastructure, or skill base. This can accelerate the fulfillment of the growth strategy and, just as important, free up internal resources to focus on other organic growth strategies.</p>
<p class="h2">Financial Tools</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can use their financial tools to encourage growth strategies. This includes analyzing what needs to be done and providing the resources to do it. For example, if the strategic plan calls for a specified growth rate, they can help to quantify the potential sources of this growth. This can be especially enlightening if it highlights gaps between the aspirations and the realities—indicating that the company needs to increase its efforts to generate growth and focus on the business strategies that have the most potential to close the gaps.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, they can help analyze whether the growth strategies have sufficient resources to succeed. It's much better to have a few well-funded growth initiatives than to dissipate the resources over several underfunded projects that have relatively low probabilities of success.</p>
<p class="para">As part of their annual budget, CFOs can establish an unallocated pool of resources to be used—at the CEO's discretion—in funding growth opportunities that may arise during the year. In a fast moving world, the company's ability to move swiftly should not be constrained by either resource or budgetary constraints.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs can influence the company's appetite for new products by the cost accounting procedures used to evaluate their profitability. For example, a cost accounting system that emphasizes economic contribution margins is likely to be more favorable for new products than one which applies full costing from the outset.</p>
<p class="para">Above all, CFOs should emphasize economic benefits rather than accounting impacts when evaluating growth initiatives. They will need to consider the net income ramifications when determining the priorities for projects, but this should be the final and not the first way to evaluate them. A project should not be killed prematurely.</p>
<p class="h2">Partnering</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can adopt a mindset as facilitators of growth. Rather than reinforcing the hoary stereotype that they are knee-jerk naysayers to a business unit's creativity and ambitions, CFOs can emphasize their role in encouraging rather than retarding the proposed growth strategies. Functioning as a facilitator of growth is consistent with becoming more of a strategic partner with the business leaders—a role that is being enthusiastically embraced by enlightened CFOs.</p>
<p class="para">Staying close to the business is fundamental to adding value. As described by one CFO, this can include a number of things:<a id="c16-not-0001-1" href="#c16-not-0001"><span class="superscript">1</span></a></p>
<p class="quote">First, be very connected to the business people in the company and be on top of where the business is moving or can move to. Having a finance group that is well connected and embedded in the business is the key to this.</p>
<p class="quote">Second, be connected to other external sources that provide objective input to shape the company's strategy.</p>
<p class="quote">And third, engage in a constant debate on possible scenarios and prepare the company to either take advantage of those or make defensive moves.</p>
<p class="para">Given their analytical capabilities and their company-wide exposure to potential opportunities, CFOs are unusually—perhaps uniquely—well-positioned to play a major role in identifying, prioritizing, and executing growth strategies. If the business leaders know that the CFO is committed to growth, they are more likely to work with the CFO productively in making things  happen.</p>
<p class="para">To draw the obligatory sports analogy, the CFO can be the <span class="italic">“point guard”</span> for growth—driving the ball down the court, seeing the potential plays, and finding the player with an open shot. While seldom directly responsible for generating organic growth, CFOs certainly can provide their fair share of assists.</p>
<p class="h2">Customer Relationships</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can have a direct impact on a company's revenue through their interaction with customers. This focus on the customer is especially important for CFOs of <span class="italic">business-to-business</span> companies that market their products and services to CFOs or other C-suite officers. From their experience as customers for enterprise products, they can render useful input to marketing programs, bringing their unique perspectives to the company's sales strategies. In addition, CFOs often will assume responsibility for managing their company's overall relationships with specified major customers.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, CFOs frequently make presentations to customer groups about their company's strategies and financial statements, often participating in customer convocations, including advisory group meetings. Another role is to provide reassurances to existing and potential customers concerning their company's financial health and its sustained commitment to a business or product line—reassurances that were much appreciated during the throes of the recent financial crisis.</p>
<p class="para">In <span class="italic">business-to-consumer</span> companies, CFOs also take an active interest in their company's customer relationships, although in this case their involvement is usually more indirect, such as listening to sales or customer service calls or monitoring customer complaints. This can enable them to stay engaged in the business and can provide essential contextual information for considering potential investments in technologies, marketing programs, or people.</p>
<p class="para">Although CFOs differ in the amount of time that they spend with customers, they share a common belief that staying close to customers is an important part of their job. Likewise, they feel that having first-hand exposure to areas with high growth potential—such as emerging economies—can provide crucial insights toward formulating, executing, and communicating their company's strategic objectives.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c16-2">COST REDUCTION STRATEGIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Cost cutting, of course, is a role that traditionally has been associated with the CFO position, and it's a role that has been growing in importance due to the declining number of companies that have chief operating officers. CFOs should partner with the CEO and the business leaders in driving down expenses—thereby increasing profit margins and generating funds to support revenue growth strategies.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs typically play a leadership role in developing and executing action plans to cope with near-term downturns in revenue forecasts or to respond to cyclical or systemic declines in a company's business outlook. Given the more volatile financial world in recent years, this also has been a role that has grown in importance.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs can employ a variety of proven tools for reducing a company's cost base. The trick is to select the right combination of tools for the particular challenges at hand.</p>
<p class="h2">Assigning Targets</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Probably the most common tool—often used in connection with budgeting and forecasting—is to establish cost reduction targets that are then allocated to the business unit and staff leaders to define and execute. To be successful, this approach usually requires strong top-down support from the CEO, although the CFO also plays a leadership role in developing and communicating the action plans and ensuring that they are executed in a timely and effective manner.</p>
<p class="para">This approach has the benefit of being relatively easy to administer—provided that there is cooperation from the business leaders—and can be implemented relatively quickly; therefore it is especially well-suited for rapid responses to unforeseen business downturns or financial difficulties. It also has the virtue of leaving the specific decisions in the hands of the business leaders, who usually are in the best position to make the tough choices and who typically appreciate the respect for their autonomy.</p>
<p class="para">The main disadvantage is that assigning targets is necessarily arbitrary and may not reflect the best prioritization throughout the company. Almost inevitably, someone will loudly denounce this approach as using a “meat axe rather than a scalpel.”</p>
<p class="para">Another potential disadvantage is that if used too often, this approach can cause business leaders to defer cost reduction actions until their targets have been assigned, thus making it easier to fulfill their mandates. This can foster a reactive rather than a proactive culture.</p>
<p class="h2">Reorganizing Functions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another approach is to analyze specific functions across the company, then to drive savings through the implementation of shared services, outsourcing arrangements, and organizational efficiencies—often with guidance from industry benchmarking statistics that are obtained from consulting firms or other third-party sources. This approach is especially effective for analyzing functions that are widely dispersed throughout the company, such as information technology, finance, human resources, legal, facilities, and procurement activities.</p>
<p class="para">The first step in this approach is to develop a company-wide summary of the costs, which often represents the first time that the costs have been accumulated in a comprehensive total. This calculation can be eye-opening, which, by itself, can reveal opportunities for significant cost reductions. However, CFOs typically go to the next phase, which is to assign responsibilities for reducing the function's total costs through programs and action steps that cross geographical and organizational boundaries.</p>
<p class="para">An issue that arises with this approach is whether to change the budgeting procedures. The main alternatives are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Decentralize and Allocate:</span> Continue to budget the costs within the respective business units or staff departments and record any savings as they occur.</li><li><span class="bold">Centralize and Allocate:</span> Budget the costs within a centralized cost center, but allocate the cost savings to the business units and staff departments at the end of the period.</li><li><span class="bold">Centralize and Retain:</span> Budget the costs within a centralized cost center and retain any savings in the cost center—making it less likely that they get spent.</li></ul>

<p class="para">It is probably safe to say that there is no right answer for this budgeting dilemma, with CFOs choosing the system that works best for their purposes. The potential savings usually are sufficient to justify some flexibility in approach, and the process of allocating the savings certainly shouldn't get in the way of taking decisive actions.</p>
<p class="para">The other general observation about this approach is that the <span class="italic">governance arrangements</span> are important in driving its success; it usually takes a combination of a strong project leader, support from the top, and some type of oversight committee that represents the business units and staff departments that are affected.</p>
<p class="h2">Expense Categories</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another common approach is to analyze expense categories that are relatively small in each cost center, but which can add up to large savings opportunities when aggregated across the company. In this approach, certain expense categories are identified as fruitful areas to attack, and then to assign responsibilities for attacking them. Often these responsibilities are lodged with procurement people, but a CFO may prefer to assign someone from the finance organization who has skills in managing projects and motivating changes in behavior.</p>
<p class="para">For example, many companies have been able to make significant reductions in their document management costs by establishing company-wide rules for printing and storing documents and records. Other common examples include expenses for mobile devices, personal computers, travel, and temporary workers.</p>
<p class="para">In implementing this approach, CFOs typically take the following  steps:</p><div class="list"><div class="item1">Step 1. <span class="italic">Aggregate spending</span> in the expense category across the company (or perhaps throughout the U.S. or another geographic region).
</div>
<div class="item1">Step 2. <span class="italic">Centralize</span> <span class="italic">procurement</span> of the expense category, usually with a single vendor or two, which are chosen through a competitive process.
</div>
<div class="item1">Step 3. <span class="italic">Develop procedures</span> and rules for determining when the expense can be incurred (such as centralized versus personal printing, or limits on document storage periods).
</div>
<div class="item1">Step 4. <span class="italic">Impose requirements</span> that everyone must follow the company's procedures and use the designated vendors.
</div>

</div>

<p class="para">Typically, these projects have relatively small impact in each cost center, but result in material savings in aggregate. However, the savings require the active cooperation and participation by people throughout the company, which may be difficult to achieve due to their desire to maintain autonomy and existing relationships. Therefore, this approach also requires strong support from the top.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, implementing this type of program often requires an investment in technology systems for accumulating the data and monitoring the expenses. Consequently, it is usually a longer-term effort and not something that can be instituted quickly in response to a near-term expense target.</p>
<p class="h2">Healthcare Costs</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Within U.S. companies, CFOs are finding it especially fruitful to attack healthcare costs, which is a spending category that has been growing at an alarmingly rapid rate. Especially in an environment where it is difficult to pass through price increases, a double-digit annual escalation of costs is simply unsustainable for most companies.</p>
<p class="para">In response, CFOs are partnering with their human resource leaders to rein in healthcare costs as best they can. To date, they have focused primarily on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transferring more of the costs to employees, using industry benchmarks for the percentage of costs borne by employers versus the costs paid by employees.</li><li>Using health maintenance organizations and other managed care programs to lower the costs per employee, including a greater use of generic prescriptions.</li><li>Creating incentives for employees to choose less expensive programs with alternative modules for their particular needs.</li><li>Imposing a surcharge if an employee's spouse enrolls in the company's program rather than obtaining coverage through the spouse's employer.</li></ul>

<p class="para">These efforts generally have enabled costs to grow at a lower rate than the overall healthcare inflation rate, but still at a much faster rate than the overall consumer price index. Therefore, additional steps are being pursued, including greater emphasis on measures that prevent the need for healthcare in the first place. These steps can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing medical clinics, prescription drug outlets, and wellness centers at company sites.</li><li>Imposing surcharges on smokers, or providing subsidies for cessation of smoking or for participation in wellness activities, such as exercise programs.</li><li>Lowering the copayments on prescription drugs, thus reducing the probability of an employee incurring a debilitating illness.</li></ul>

<p class="para">Despite all of these efforts, CFOs may feel like they are putting fingers in the dikes to retard the growth in healthcare costs, which are rising inexorably in the United States. Therefore, companies are factoring relative healthcare costs into their global employment strategies, with an advantage to locating employees in countries that provide healthcare through governmental programs. They also are considering healthcare costs in outsourcing decisions.</p>
<p class="h2">Compensation Expense</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Compensation is another expense category that falls primarily under the domain of the chief human resource officer, but that CFOs should influence, especially in people-intensive businesses. For example, in recent years many companies have frozen or even reduced salaries and have suspended some benefits programs, such as their 401(k) matches for employees in the United States.</p>
<p class="para">However, <span class="italic">performance management</span> should be the primary tool for controlling compensation costs in most companies. By linking pay to performance, companies can counteract the notion that annual merit increases are an entitlement and can relate pay increases to an employee's annual performance appraisal. In addition, companies should conform their pay practices to conditions in the labor market—compensating employees according to their worth as determined by the market for equivalent skills and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="h2">Hiring Freeze</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Hiring freezes are frequently used to gain rapid reductions in head counts and compensation costs. However, while these programs can work well as a short-term response to profit pressures, they are a relatively inefficient method for shrinking the work force.</p>
<p class="para">Using this approach, the headcount reductions are largely dependent upon the rate of voluntary turnover—which may decline dramatically if there is an overall rise in unemployment in the economy—and in the areas where there is turnover, key positions may remain unfilled. Therefore, hiring freezes typically are accompanied by a process for granting <span class="italic">exceptions,</span> especially for revenue-producing positions.</p>
<p class="para">Indeed, many of the benefits of a hiring freeze can be obtained simply by increasing the <span class="italic">bureaucracy</span> involved in filling or adding a position. The most common example is to require that additions to headcount must receive specific approval from business leaders, the CFO, or the CEO—depending on the level of the position being added. This simple requirement can have a pronounced effect on the speed at which positions are added or filled, resulting in material cost savings.</p>
<p class="para">Another technique is to assume, for budgeting purposes, that there will be an estimated level of turnover each year, and rather than assuming the positions will be filled immediately, to budget for an assumed number of months that will be required to fill the position. This deters managers from hiring in advance of their needs and imposes additional discipline in the hiring process.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, it has been argued that one of the benefits of installing human resource software is that it makes it harder to fill positions due to the steps that need to be followed to comply with the system. While this certainly is not the stated purpose for this software, there is merit in the argument that rigid system requirements can cause managers to move more slowly and perhaps more thoughtfully in their headcount decisions. And a relatively small addition in the time required to fill a position can have a significant impact if applied on a company-wide basis.</p>
<p class="h2">Restructuring Program</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can also establish a major restructuring program that is focused on reducing headcount. This can be a major source of cost savings—both the direct compensation expense and the indirect expenses (such as facilities and travel) that are associated with the headcount.</p>
<p class="para">Announcing a restructuring program has two major advantages:</p><div class="list"><div class="item1">1. If it is big enough, the analysts and investors typically will view the severance and restructuring expenses as <span class="italic">one-time costs</span> that do not affect the company's long-term run rate. However, this requires CFOs to use this technique judiciously because if restructurings become too common, they will be construed as an ongoing <span class="italic">cost of doing business,</span> irrespective of the size of the program.
</div>
<div class="item1">2. Announcing a company-wide program can <span class="italic">remove much of the stigma,</span> allowing managers to reassure employees that they are not being singled out. Some areas can be excluded from the program—usually customer-facing positions—but if the program is generally widespread throughout the company, it arguably will encounter less resistance from the people affected.
</div>

</div>

<p class="para">With the announcement of a restructuring program, the CFO and management team usually can achieve the target reduction in headcount through a systematic review of the company's functions and organizational structure, with the goal of eliminating duplicate or unnecessary activities and streamlining the organization (e.g., by establishing a global rather than a matrix chain of command or by enlarging spans of control and eliminating layers of management).</p>
<p class="para">Often CFOs will work with outside consultants in implementing a restructuring program; the consultants can bring specialized expertise in identifying cost reduction opportunities and can provide discipline and objectivity to the process, mitigating some of the inherent difficulties in eliminating the positions of long-time colleagues.</p>
<p class="h2">Scenario Analysis</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs also have achieved success through their use of contingency or scenario planning. For example, the CFO can lead an exercise to identify cost savings that could be implemented, if necessary, in response to an unforeseen decline in revenue. If this type of planning is done in advance—often in connection with the preparation of a company's budget or long-term financial projections—the company can act more quickly and decisively in the event that the contingency does occur.</p>
<p class="para">Another example is for the CFO to lead an analytical review of the company's cost base with the same kind of rigor and discipline that would be used by a private equity firm in connection with a management buyout. Consistent with the oft-cited objective to <span class="italic">“spend the company's money as if it's your own,</span>” this analysis can reveal activities that are “nice to have” versus those that are <span class="italic">“</span>mission critical.”</p>
<p class="h2">Quality Programs</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Dating back to the work by W. Edwards Deming in post-war Japan, <span class="italic">Total Quality Management (TQM)</span> programs have allowed companies to achieve significant and continuous long-term savings through the application of scientifically based programs to revamp processes. TQM programs are generally based on statistical tools that facilitate fact-based decision making and a commitment to continuous improvement throughout the company.</p>
<p class="para">In recent decades, the most well-known programs have been “Six Sigma,” which was popularized by Motorola in the 1980s, and “Lean Manufacturing,” which evolved from developments in the automotive industry and was publicly embraced by General Electric in the 1990s. In both cases, the programs focus on an analysis of processes and the use of data to streamline the work flow.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Six Sigma</span> seeks to reduce defects to 3.4 per million opportunities. It uses the DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) principles in projects that focus on specific processes or designs. This program typically uses trained facilitators (called “green belts” or “black belts”) who work with a project sponsor to produce quantifiable results.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Lean Manufacturing</span> focuses primarily on eliminating waste, which generally relates to any activity or cost that is not valued by the customer. Despite the name, it is not confined to manufacturing operations and can be used to improve any process that involves products or services used by either external or internal customers. It seeks to create processes that are efficient and consistently repeatable throughout a chain of value creation activities.</p>
<p class="para">TQM programs have been shown to produce significant benefits and are valuable arrows in the CFO's quiver of cost-cutting techniques. However, unless properly circumscribed, these programs can become a permanent cost center, offsetting some of the benefits that are generated. Therefore, the best practice is to embed these tools and ways of thinking throughout the company, so that fact-based decision making and continuous improvements become second nature among all of the employees instead of a one-off program.</p>
<p class="h2">Continuous Improvements</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Even without a formal TQM program, most CFOs believe that it is central to their job description to inculcate a culture of continuous improvement throughout their companies, including their financial organizations. This is particularly true for CFOs in low-margin industries, but cost consciousness is arguably an appropriate mindset for all CFOs. If their primary focus is growth, their efforts to free up costs can fund additional growth strategies or make existing strategies more viable due to the higher margins that can be earned on a new product or service.</p>
<p class="para">Given the fierce competition that exists in most industries, it is axiomatic that CFOs never get complacent—that they openly embrace new technologies, constantly institute new ways of doing things, and ruthlessly jettison those activities and functions that are no longer essential.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c16-3">FIXED VERSUS VARIABLE COSTS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs are focusing not just on the aggregate size of their company's cost base, but also on its composition—notably the mix between fixed and variable costs. Depending on the characteristics of a company's assets—as well as the volatility of its revenue, earnings, and cash flows—the CFO should establish an appropriate balance of fixed and variable costs, thereby smoothing the company's financial results over a business cycle.</p>
<p class="para">In considering the costs, CFOs typically view employees as largely a fixed cost—at least over the near-term planning horizon. Given the costs of recruiting and training the work force and recognizing the severance and other costs inherent to most work force reductions, CFOs should closely monitor headcounts and consider outsourcing or other contract arrangements—thereby increasing their flexibility in responding to uncertain and possibly volatile business conditions.</p>
<p class="para">Likewise, they should have a point of view concerning the components of the compensation program, especially the mix of fixed versus variable compensation. This mix should reflect and reinforce the company's strategic plan objectives.</p>
<p class="para">For example, using temporary workers can provide much more flexibility than hiring permanent employees and can save considerable costs in a downturn, including severance payments and higher unemployment insurance premiums. Therefore, CFOs may want to target a percentage of the work force that should come from temporary or part-time employees.</p>
<p class="para">In preparing their long-term financial projections, CFOs often will perform sensitivity analyses, including upside and downside business cases. They can gain important insights through these analyses from observing the impact due to costs that are constant versus those that fluctuate. In particular, they can focus on the breakeven rates for earnings and cash flow.</p>
<p class="para">These analyses often can highlight the advantage of moving toward more of a variable cost base, especially given the level of uncertainty that seems to be endemic in the twenty-first century.</p>
