<p class="chaptertitle">Chapter Eleven</p>
<p class="chaptertitle">Responding to Takeover Offers</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">WITHOUT QUESTION, responding to a potential takeover offer can be a significant test of the CFO's leadership skills and analytical capabilities. The criticality of this responsibility applies to CFOs of both private and public companies, although they will be much more subject to legal considerations and constraints in a public company context.</p>
<p class="para">Indeed, it has become axiomatic for public company CFOs—along with CEOs and boards of directors—to profess their commitment to maximizing shareholder value, including being open to the possibility of a third-party purchase of the company. This does not mean that companies must solicit an offer or to respond favorably if an offer is received, but in the modern corporate finance environment, it does mean that they must give careful consideration to any bona fide offer, including an objective evaluation of its merits.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c11-1">GOVERNANCE POLICIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should be well aware of their companies' governance policies, which have become increasingly important considerations among investors. While takeover defenses in the past were often viewed positively as protections against a corporate raider or as vehicles for negotiating a better price, they now are viewed more critically by many investors and the shareholder advisory services (such as Institutional Stockholder Services and Glass Lewis).</p>
<p class="para">For example, many investors advocate that a company's governance policies should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Independent Chairman:</span> Separate Chairman and CEO roles, or a Lead Director at minimum.</li><li><span class="bold">No Staggered Boards:</span> A single class of directors who are elected each year.</li><li><span class="bold">One Class of Stock:</span> Equal voting rights among all shareholders.</li><li><span class="bold">No Shareholder Rights Plan:</span> Redemption of existing rights (“poison pill”) and no new plan (but boards usually preserve their ability to enact a plan in the future).</li><li><span class="bold">Majority Director Votes:</span> Majority vote in favor of a director, or at minimum, director's offer to resign if receives less than a majority vote.</li><li><span class="bold">No Supermajority Voting:</span> Majority of outstanding shares to approve a takeover rather than a higher percentage.</li><li><span class="bold">No State Law Restrictions:</span> Not subject to state laws that require consideration of other constituencies besides shareholders or that impose other restrictions.</li><li><span class="bold">Special Meetings:</span> Ability of shareholder groups to call special meetings.</li></ul>

<p class="para">In addition, shareholders have advocated greater influence over management compensation (“<span class="italic">say on pay</span>”) and ability to make proposals through proxy statements (“<span class="italic">proxy access</span>”).</p>
<p class="para">Through a combination of voluntary actions and governmental mandates (e.g., the Dodd-Frank Act), companies have made remarkable strides in their governance policies in recent years. CFOs should be aware of their company's changes—which can be positive factors in their investor relations programs—and be knowledgeable about the governance polices that will establish the context for the board's evaluation of potential proposals.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c11-2">REVIEWING AN OFFER</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Upon receiving a takeover proposal, the board of directors will initiate a process to review the offer and to determine the appropriate response. It may establish a <span class="italic">special committee</span> of independent directors who will facilitate the review on behalf of the board.</p>
<p class="para">Depending on the nature of the offer and whether it has been made public, the board may choose to enact a <span class="italic">shareholder rights plan (poison pill)</span> that  gives the company more flexibility in the timing of its response. It does not matter if the board previously withdrew a plan; it can institute a new one, provided that it has not made a commitment to the contrary.</p>
<p class="para">In almost all cases, the board will engage financial advisors to assist in its review of the proposal, as well as external counsel who will guide the company through the labyrinth of laws and governance rules that surround a public company's actions under these circumstances. While the board is not under any compulsion to take specific actions, it is subject to fiduciary obligations to its shareholders; thus, the board will be very circumspect and deliberate in performing its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="para">Although the board will make the choice of financial advisors to engage, the CFO may be asked to orchestrate a process to consider the alternatives and to provide input concerning the candidates for this role. Normally, the board will interview advisory candidates through a formal process, including written presentations that outline their qualifications and address the board's criteria. The board typically will review each candidate's <span class="italic">potential conflicts</span> (especially any business relationships with the other party); its <span class="italic">prior interactions</span> with the company; its <span class="italic">experience</span> in similar advisory assignments; and most important, its <span class="italic">proposed approach</span> to this particular assignment, including the individuals who will form the <span class="italic">advisory team.</span></p>
<p class="h2">Strategic Plan Projections</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">After the advisors have been engaged, the CFO plays an important role in providing the information that will inform much of their review of alternatives, which can range from maintaining the current course, to pursuing a sale of the company, to a variety of alternatives in between. To this end, the CFO will organize a process to share information with the financial advisors concerning the company's historical financial performance and its outlook, as indicated by the strategic plan and long-term financial model.</p>
<p class="para">The company's financial advisors will play the primary role in evaluating the takeover offer and will provide objective assessments concerning the offer in comparison with the current plan or other alternatives. However, the financial advisors generally will rely a great deal on assumptions and projections provided by the company. The CFO should ensure that the financial advisors have a thorough understanding of the strategic plan and that they have a sophisticated appreciation for the various assumptions and methodologies that underpin the financial projections.</p>
<p class="para">The CFO will also play a leadership role in analyzing potential alternatives to the strategic plan that are suggested by the financial advisors as a way to unlock shareholder value. For example, the company might evaluate the potential desirability of a divestiture, with the proceeds used to pay a special dividend or to repurchase stock. Another alternative might be a financing transaction—such as an increase in debt leverage—that may create additional value.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c11-3">CONDUCTING A SALE PROCESS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">If the board of directors determines that a sale of the company is in the shareholders' best interest, then the CFO will be an important player in the team that conducts the process for the potential sale transaction. Because the company's consideration of alternatives will be subject to legal and regulatory constraints—notably the <span class="italic">“Revlon”</span> obligation to obtain the best price for shareholders—the integrity of the process becomes extremely important from this point forward, which creates a necessity for the CFO to operate within this framework.</p>
<p class="para">Subject to the guidance provided by the company's legal and financial advisors, the CFO usually will play an active role in the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying potential acquirers who should be contacted as part of the process.</li><li>Developing historical and projected financial information to be provided to potential acquirers.</li><li>Assembling detailed due diligence materials to be included in the data room.</li><li>Making knowledgeable experts available to answer detailed questions with respect to the company's historical financial results, financial projections, and due diligence materials.</li><li>Meeting with potential acquirers to discuss the company's strategies, financial performance, and financing plans.</li><li>Keeping the rating agencies updated concerning the current status and potential actions.</li><li>Communicating with investors, as appropriate, concerning the sale process.</li></ul>

<p class="h1" id="c11-4">ACTIVIST SHAREHOLDERS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In the modern financial world, companies may be confronted with activist shareholders who suggest actions that they believe will create shareholder value. In this event, the CFO will help the company to evaluate the proposals, which may have been communicated publicly.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs will work closely with the company's financial advisors in reviewing the alternatives—much in the way that they would in connection with a takeover proposal—and evaluating whether they will create shareholder value in comparison with the company's existing strategic plan. In performing this role, CFOs will objectively analyze the financial implications of the alternatives being considered and elucidate their potential advantages and disadvantages—including any financial or execution risks—so that the board of directors has the best information possible in formulating the company's response.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c11-5">GOING PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A <span class="italic">management buyout</span> may be considered as an alternative to a takeover proposal from a third party or in connection with reviewing a proposal from an activist shareholder. In addition, the management team may propose a going private transaction as a way to enhance shareholder value.</p>
<p class="para">In each of these potential scenarios, CFOs should recognize the potential conflicts of interest, especially in light of the board's fiduciary duty to maximize the value for shareholders in a change of control transaction. At a certain point, the CFO's role may necessarily shift from a disinterested analyst to an interested participant.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, CFOs should recognize that even a relatively informal analysis of a going private transaction can inadvertently trigger market rumors that stimulate speculative trading in the company's stock—perhaps creating pressures for the company to respond through a public statement. Consequently, CFOs should be circumspect about engaging in a dialogue with private equity firms unless they have explicit approval from their CEO and board of directors—and should be especially cautious in providing projections or other confidential information.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, with appropriate guidance, CFOs should be able to navigate the legal and ethical requirements in considering a potential management buyout. In particular, a management buyout may make sense if the company's stock price is judged to be undervalued or if management needs to take actions that are likely to depress the stock price for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="para">In these instances, it may be appropriate for the CFO to work with an investment bank in assessing whether the company's cash flow and earnings can produce an offer that is likely to be competitive with other alternatives. If so, then it may be appropriate to initiate a dialogue with one or a few private equity firms.</p>
