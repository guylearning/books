<p class="paraaftertitle">This book is organized around the seven <span class="italic">essential</span> roles of the modern CFO—the core responsibilities that, to a greater or lesser degree, are likely to be part of every CFO's job description. These roles encompass responsibilities for strategy, capital allocations, mergers and acquisitions, funding, performance, accounting and controls, and leadership.</p>
<p class="para">Although not intended to be a “day in the life” of the CFO position, this book highlights the breadth of responsibilities and discusses some of the strategies, techniques, and best practices that CFOs employ in addressing their expanding roles. It provides a framework—a corporate finance <span class="italic">playbook</span>—for organizing and executing their game plan.</p>
<p class="para">This playbook explicitly recognizes that there are no cookie-cutter answers and that the optimal game plan inevitably will reflect the specific facts and circumstances of the particular CFO and company involved. Nevertheless, systematically reviewing their contemporary roles and responsibilities should be a beneficial exercise for both new and experienced CFOs. More important, this playbook can be an invaluable tool for all finance professionals and business students who aspire to financial leadership—highlighting the spectrum of skills that will be required for their long-term advancement.</p>
<p class="para">At the same time, it should prove useful to accountants, attorneys, bankers, brokers, consultants, technology vendors, and anyone else who offers products and services to CFOs and their financial organizations. In fact, it's hoped that it can benefit anyone who is interested in learning more about business and finance from the CFO's vantage point.</p>
<p class="para">This book is divided into seven parts and twenty-four chapters. Summary overviews are provided below.</p>
<p class="h2">Strategy</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Part One describes the CFO's role in defining and communicating the company's strategic plan—achieving alignment around business and financial objectives that are designed to produce total shareholder return. It also discusses how the CFO focuses on enterprise risks, which goes hand in glove with the development of the strategic plan.</p>
<p class="h3">Articulating a Strategic Plan</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 1 discusses the process of developing a strategic plan. It argues that this plan should guide all of the company's business and financial strategies and form the basis for the company's communications with investors and other stakeholders. The plan should incorporate business objectives, strategic themes, financial objectives, and acquisition strategies—all with target shareholders in mind.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also describes the creation of a long-term financial model—translating the strategic plan into a financial framework and confirming that the strategies will, in fact, create shareholder value. This value creation is encapsulated in the company's goal for delivering total shareholder return, which reflects a combination of share price appreciation and dividend yield.</p>
<p class="h3">Communicating and Achieving Alignment</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 2 provides an overview of the CFO's role in communicating the strategic plan, stressing the need for consistency and transparency in achieving seamless alignment among both internal and external stakeholders. It argues that CFOs should provide input to the design of incentive compensation programs, which can reinforce the strategic plan's objectives.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also describes the CFO's mission in communicating the company's story to investors and the media, arguing that this has become a higher priority due to investor appetite for more information and the burgeoning of media outlets. It stresses that the CFO should help to frame the message points and coordinate consistent messaging throughout the various communication channels.</p>
<p class="h3">Assessing Enterprise Risks</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 3 addresses the CFO's role in assessing enterprise risks. It describes the implementation of an enterprise risk management program and highlights the unique perspectives that CFOs can bring to the program.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also highlights some of the risk areas that have become more salient in the current environment. It argues that CFOs should seek to maximize the benefits from “rewarded” risks, while protecting the company from “unrewarded” risks.</p>
<p class="h2">Capital Allocations</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Part Two reviews the CFO's role in allocating capital, which is critical to the implementation of the strategic plan. This requires dexterous navigation among competing priorities, including investment projects, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases.</p>
<p class="h3">Estimating the Cost of Capital</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 4 describes the process of estimating a company's cost of capital, including the determination of “betas” and the other variables used in the capital asset pricing model. It also discusses the potential use of a “hurdle rate,” including the possibility of adding a fudge factor or varying risk premiums.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter advocates that CFOs should use a consistent cost of capital to evaluate all of the company's investment projects and acquisitions—without adding a fudge factor or risk premiums—and should emphasize subjective judgments in comparing the alternatives.</p>
<p class="h3">Prioritizing Capital Investments</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 5 focuses on the prioritization of capital investments, describing the iterative process for establishing a capital investment budget and allocating this budget among potential projects. It reviews the evaluation criteria and emphasizes that the investment priorities should reflect a number of factors besides net present values, including both financial and non-financial considerations.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also highlights the CFO's role in monitoring projects after they are approved, including the value to be harvested from “real options” and the information to be gleaned about the credibility of project sponsors and the company's track record by type of project.</p>
<p class="h3">Considering Dividends and Repurchases</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 6 focuses on returning cash to shareholders through either dividends or share repurchases. It discusses the pros and cons of alternative dividend policies and reviews the tradeoffs between paying dividends versus repurchasing shares, as well as the methods for implementing a share repurchase program.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also discusses the possibility of retaining “strategic” cash. It cites the potential benefits from greater financial flexibility—while highlighting the potentially negative reactions from shareholders—and stresses adherence to approved investment policies.</p>
<p class="h2">Mergers and Acquisitions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Part Three outlines the creation of value through mergers and acquisitions, which can be quicker, cheaper, and less risky alternatives to purely organic growth. It also describes the CFO's role in executing divestitures and spinoffs and potentially responding to a takeover offer or other strategic proposal.</p>
<p class="h3">Identifying Acquisition Candidates</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 7 discusses the identification of acquisition candidates, highlighting the ways that CFOs can increase the odds of a successful  transaction—including sticking to adjacent spaces, taking a portfolio approach, exercising patience and flexibility, and requiring a business sponsor who is personally accountable for the transaction. It also describes the importance of clearly identifying the strategic purpose for an acquisition, drawing distinctions among consolidation, bolt-on, platform, and transformative transactions.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter argues that CFOs should facilitate—but not drive—the transactions and that the acquisitions should be motivated primarily by strategic rather than financial considerations.</p>
<p class="h3">Evaluating Acquisition Candidates</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 8 describes the criteria for evaluating an acquisition candidate, including valuation methodologies—such as discounted cash flows, comparable companies, precedent transactions, leveraged buyout, and premiums paid analyses—as well as pro forma financial analyses. Other criteria include the impact on the company's stock price and whether the proposed transaction will exacerbate or mitigate enterprise risks.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter advocates determining both the target's standalone value and the net value of synergies and then calculating how much of the value created is retained by the acquirer.</p>
<p class="h3">Executing a Merger or Acquisition</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 9 reviews the CFO's role in executing a merger or acquisition, including conducting due diligence; preparing a business plan; determining pricing parameters; arranging acquisition financing; and negotiating contract terms. It also describes the integration of an acquisition, including monitoring of results against the business plan.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter describes the CFO's role in determining the deal terms and stresses that, to avoid overpaying, the acquirer should not be too anxious to do a deal or too fixated on a particular target.</p>
<p class="h3">Executing Divestitures and Spinoffs</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 10 outlines the reasons for pursuing a divestiture and then reviews the process for executing the transaction, including the decisions whether to hire an investment banker, conduct an auction or a negotiated transaction, and structure it as a stock or asset deal. It also discusses the possibility of a tax-free spinoff (including a “Morris Trust” variation) as well as “split-up” and “equity carve-out” alternatives.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter argues that CFOs can add considerable value by regularly pruning a company's business portfolio and through their quality of execution in a divestiture or spinoff scenario.</p>
<p class="h3">Responding to Takeover Offers</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 11 discusses the CFO's role in a company's response to a takeover offer, including the preparation of financial projections and coordination of external advisors. It also describes the expanded responsibilities if the board of directors decides to pursue a sale transaction.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter emphasizes that CFOs should be fully prepared in advance of a potential proposal, including understanding the company's governance provisions, maintaining an up-to-date long-term financial model, and continuously reviewing possible strategic or financial actions to add shareholder value.</p>
<p class="h2">Funding</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Part Four reviews the CFO's role as the primary architect and manager of the capital structure, including establishing capital structure objectives; developing financing strategies; analyzing financing alternatives; and obtaining short-term and long-term financing.</p>
<p class="h3">Establishing Capital Structure Objectives</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 12 describes the criteria for setting capital structure targets, including the ratio of debt to market capitalization and other leverage ratios used by analysts in the company's industry or contained in its debt covenants.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also describes the implications of obtaining alternative debt ratings from the major rating agencies, especially the distinction between investment grade and speculative debt. It discusses the criteria used by the rating agencies and stresses that CFOs should maintain an active dialogue with the agencies.</p>
<p class="h3">Developing Financing Strategies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 13 discusses the CFO's role in determining the financing mix in the company's capital structure. It advocates core financing principles—keep it simple, preserve flexibility, continue to evolve, and react opportunistically—and describes debt and equity financing alternatives, as well as off balance sheet financing.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also describes debt maturity objectives, fixed versus floating rate debt tradeoffs, financing in a foreign currency, maintenance and incurrence debt covenants, debt refinancings, debt for equity exchanges, and bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="h3">Ensuring Short-Term Liquidity</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 14 highlights the CFO's responsibility for ensuring adequate liquidity. This involves cultivating banking relationships, establishing revolving credit lines and other sources of short-term financing, instituting rigorous cash planning processes, and developing contingency plans for unanticipated liquidity needs.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also describes the CFO's role in working capital management, including regularly monitoring liquidity ratios and actively managing accounts receivable, accounts payable, inventory, and cash to enhance cash flow from operations.</p>
<p class="h3">Obtaining Long-Term Financing</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 15 reviews the potential sources of long-term financing, including venture capital, private equity, initial public offerings, subsequent equity issuances (secondary, follow-on, and ATM offerings), bank term loans, syndicated bank loans, investment grade securities, high yield securities, and strategic alliances.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter discusses the pros and cons of each of the alternatives and argues that CFOs should strive to strike the right balance between cost and flexibility.</p>
<p class="h2">Performance</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Part Five describes the transition of CFOs from serving as scorekeepers to becoming players who help to deliver business and financial results. This includes generating organic revenue growth; reducing the cost structure; using budgets, forecasts, and metrics to drive performance; and managing financial risks and taxes.</p>
<p class="h3">Driving Business Performance</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 16 reviews the CFO's role in producing organic revenue growth and managing the cost structure. It argues that CFOs should partner with the business leaders and share ownership for achieving the company's performance targets. This includes adopting a mindset for encouraging growth and taking an active interest in customer relationships.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also describes the numerous tools that CFOs can use to reduce costs, ranging from short-term contingent actions to long-term reengineering of functions and processes. It advocates attacking company-wide cost categories and adopting fixed versus variable cost strategies that complement the strategic plan objectives.</p>
<p class="h3">Providing Planning and Analysis</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 17 highlights the ability of CFOs to drive results through their leadership of the budgeting and forecasting processes and the establishment of performance metrics, including non-financial measures that are enablers of the strategic plan. It also describes the processes for preparing budgets and forecasts and the systems for measuring business unit performance.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter advocates a focus on cash as well as accounting results— including regular cash flow forecasts—and argues for fewer and simpler performance metrics, with a bias toward actionable items rather than voluminous details.</p>
<p class="h3">Managing Financial Risks and Taxes</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 18 focuses on the risk management activities that are directly managed by the CFO, including the development and administration of cost-effective insurance programs. It also discusses strategies for managing interest rate, currency, commodity, inflation, and pension fund risks.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter discusses the CFO's oversight of the tax planning functions, emphasizing the establishment of clear management objectives—such as avoiding excessive risk, reducing complexity, performing holistic analyses, and ensuring compliance—as well as a focus on potential areas of opportunity—such as net operating losses, transfer pricing, and special credits.</p>
<p class="h2">Accounting and Controls</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Part Six discusses the establishment of accounting and control processes and the ways that CFOs are responding to the challenges arising from additional regulations and new accounting pronouncements. It also describes the CFO's leadership role in preparing for an earnings announcement.</p>
<p class="h3">Establishing Accounting Processes</p>

It discusses the factors that can affect the accounting environment, including automation, technology tools, documentation, various checks and balances, and the overriding importance of having good people.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also describes recent trends in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and argues for active coordination with the external auditors and the audit committee.</p>
<p class="h3">Communicating Financial Results</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 20 discusses the preparations for quarterly and annual earnings announcements. It emphasizes a rigorous focus on identifying business and financial issues; crystallizing the company's response to these issues; and ensuring alignment in communications with investors, the media, and all stakeholders, especially employees. It also argues for transparent communications.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also addresses two topics that are top-of-mind among CFOs: the use of non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures and whether to provide earnings guidance.</p>
<p class="h3">Implementing Sarbanes-Oxley</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 21 discusses the procedures adopted by CFOs in their implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley. It enumerates the main provisions of the act and focuses specifically on three provisions: requiring auditor independence; certifying financial statements; and testing the adequacy of financial controls, including the identification of deficiencies, significant deficiencies, and material weaknesses.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also describes the CFO's challenge in reaping benefits from the Sarbanes-Oxley requirements, while at the same time minimizing bureaucracy and incremental costs.</p>
<p class="h3">Reinforcing Compliance and Controls</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 22 describes the CFO's role in reinforcing compliance and controls. It describes proven management practices—such as establishing a strong tone at the top, promulgating a code of conduct, and adopting a zero tolerance standard—and argues that the company's internal and external auditors as well as its audit committee can be powerful allies in this effort.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter also describes the new Dodd-Frank whistleblower awards and the need for companies to focus on their internal whistleblower processes. It argues that given the explosion of regulations, CFOs should seek to reduce the company's cost of compliance by consolidating activities and streamlining processes.</p>
<p class="h2">Leadership</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Part Seven discusses the CFO's role as leader of the financial organization. This includes fostering effective communications throughout an organization that is becoming more complex and increasingly global; driving effectiveness and efficiencies as a continuing priority; and developing a talent base to meet the challenges of the current environment, as well as the anticipated requirements for the next phases of the company's evolution and growth.</p>
<p class="h3">Achieving Finance Transformation</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 23 describes the CFO's overarching objective of achieving “finance transformation.” This usually is a shorthand term used by CFOs to encompass their goals of revising the organizational structure, implementing new technology systems, reengineering processes, utilizing outsourcing arrangements, and emphasizing analysis over data.</p>
<p class="para">This chapter argues that the transformation should be implemented incrementally and that its success requires strong support from the top and superior project management skills. The benefits—which can include enhanced effectiveness, greater efficiencies, and strengthened controls—can more than justify the disruptions and risks that inevitably come with major changes in the organizational structure and transactional capabilities.</p>
<p class="h3">Developing Financial Talent</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Chapter 24 discusses the CFO's role in developing finance professionals, starting with strategies for recruiting talent through either entry level or lateral positions.
