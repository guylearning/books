<p class="chaptertitle">Providing Planning and Analysis</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs CAN ALSO DRIVE BUSINESS performance through the planning and analysis functions that are provided by the financial organization, including budgets and forecasts, which usually are the primary management tools that the CEO and business leaders use to set direction and monitor performance.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs typically define and monitor performance metrics, measure business performance, and provide business analysis.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c17-1">BUDGETS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The company's strategic objectives and long-term financial model provide the framework for crafting the annual budget. The CFO is charged with translating this framework into the detailed preparation of each of the line items in the annual budget, including their distribution among manifold profit and cost centers.</p>
<p class="para">It is typically a time-consuming and laborious job, but well worth the effort. It is fundamental to the CFO's playbook, providing direction for the company and serving as an indispensable tool for making tough choices among competing priorities.</p>
<p class="h2">Bottoms-Up, Iterative Process</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In most companies, the budget is primarily developed through a bottoms-up approach, with the profit and cost centers responsible for preparing their initial estimates for the coming fiscal year. They typically start with a forecast for the current year—which usually has several months to go—consider recent trends, and estimate a “business-as-usual” run rate for the next year.</p>
<p class="para">The next step is to overlay their plans for strategic and business initiatives, as well as their expectations for productivity improvements. This preliminary assessment also includes a tentative estimate of the capital needed to achieve their proposed plans. Thus, the preliminary budget typically is a combination of extrapolating trends and estimating discretionary actions for the next year.</p>
<p class="para">The financial organization then consolidates the numbers into a comprehensive summary, which forms the basis for a series of iterative revisions— typically achieved through review meetings with various levels of management. To facilitate these reviews, it is usually desirable for the CFO to provide as much guidance as possible concerning the targets that the company is striving to achieve.</p>
<p class="para">Eventually, a consensus is formed and, after adding revenue and expense contingencies, the CFO presents the proposed budget to the board of directors for approval. After approval, the budget is then further allocated among the profit and cost centers and divided into quarterly and monthly components.</p>
<p class="h2">Benefits of Long-Term Model</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Although a company's long-term financial projections typically are driven by top-down formulas rather than bottoms-up calculations, they nevertheless can facilitate the preparation of the annual budget—providing a good starting point for the more detailed and accounting-driven approaches that are used in preparing the budget.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, CFOs often find that their long-term financial models can be an effective check and balance against the bottoms-up assumptions that are produced by the budget process; they can help to identify assumptions that may not be realistic or that may be inconsistent with historical relationships. The long-term projections also can indicate either over-optimistic or over- pessimistic biases in the proposed budgets.</p>
<p class="para">Most important, maintaining a long-term financial model can help CFOs instill a culture of continuous adaptation to changes in business and market conditions—rather than being fixated on an annual budget cycle. This helps to perpetuate a culture of rolling forecasts whereby the company is continuously assessing and reacting to its environment, giving the CFO a valuable tool in updating business plans and driving financial performance.</p>
<p class="h2">Budget Philosophies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Companies can vary considerably in their approach to projections, with some choosing to establish “<span class="italic">stretch</span>” targets and others choosing to establish targets that are expected to be met or exceeded each year. Whatever the approach, it is important that CFOs understand the underlying philosophy that prevails throughout the company's culture and that they calibrate the budget projections to avoid communicating plans that are either impossible to achieve or else not sufficiently challenging.</p>
<p class="para">In particular, CFOs should establish “<span class="italic">contingencies</span>” or “<span class="italic">challenges,</span>” depending on whether the company tends to use aggressive or conservative assumptions. These top-down adjustments can be especially important in setting targets for incentive compensation—to ensure that the management team is incentivized appropriately.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, to the extent that CFOs include top-down adjustments in their budget projections, they should make them fully transparent to the management team and board of directors—so that there's no confusion concerning the manner in which the projections have been constructed.</p>
<p class="h2">Budget Challenges</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Although the budget process is inherently time-consuming—involving substantial give-and- takes among the participants—it is usually a relatively harmonious process. However, the budget preparations also typically feature some challenges that can be particularly vexing to CFOs, including:</p><div class="list"><div class="item1"><span class="bold">Challenge 1:</span> Allowing sufficient time for preparing the budget's financial schedules, but not having the underlying assumptions become too far out of date. Because the budget process typically stretches over several months, the original assumptions may be obsolete by the time that final decisions are being made. For example, the business forecasts will have been updated and there will have been changes to exogenous variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates.
</div>
<div class="listpara1">The CFO's typical response is to determine which variables will be updated for the various iterations and to “true up” certain assumptions at the very end of the process.
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">Challenge 2:</span> The propensity of the business units and staff departments to “low ball” their current year forecasts. Because the budget is often compared with the current year forecast—showing the year-over-year percentage changes—the business leaders may be reluctant to update their forecasts after the budget process begins. In particular, they may want to preserve “cushions” for potential expenses or revenue shortfalls in the current year and not to raise expectations for improved results in the budget year.
</div>
<div class="listpara1">In response to this gamesmanship, CFOs can encourage accurate forecasts, while also providing reassurances that this will not result in unrealistic expectations for the next year's budget.
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">Challenge 3:</span> The tendency to extrapolate trends rather than to consider new priorities and areas of focus. If the business leaders perceive that the budgeting process is primarily the responsibility of the financial organization, it can become a mechanical exercise—with too much emphasis on recent accounting trends rather than on a thoughtful review of growth plans from strategic and business perspectives. Furthermore, the costs may reflect trend lines rather than a zero-based budgeting approach.
</div>
<div class="listpara1">To address this issue, CFOs can encourage the personal and active involvement of the CEO and business leaders from the beginning of the budget process, emphasizing their critical role in determining the key assumptions and financial targets.
</div>
<div class="item1"><span class="bold">Challenge 4:</span> Becoming overly preoccupied with intra-company allocations that don't affect the overall financial results. A common frustration is that profit and cost centers may be more focused on negotiating the intra-company allocations of revenues and expenses than on generating income from external sources. While some scrutiny of allocations is healthy, it can easily cross the line into dysfunctional behavior.
</div>
<div class="listpara1">In response, CFOs should discourage the preoccupation (and squabbles) regarding allocations. For example, they can advocate a simple, formulaic approach to the allocations and reinforce among the finance professionals that they should be primarily concerned with actions that grow the pie—such as actual cost reductions in shared services—rather than on the size of their slice.
</div>

</div>

<p class="h1" id="c17-2">FORECASTS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Forecasts are indispensable tools for managing the business. They highlight where the business is on track or off track, indicate issues that may require remedial actions, and guide management's communications with the board of directors and shareholders. Without timely and reliable forecasts, management would be sailing blindly through some tempestuous waters, especially given the volatility in the financial markets.</p>
<p class="para">The first question is <span class="italic">how often</span> to produce the forecasts? And the second question is <span class="italic">how</span> <span class="italic">detailed</span> should the forecasts be? For most CFOs, there is a tradeoff between the frequency of the forecasts and their level of details.</p>
<p class="para">Most companies opt for monthl<span class="italic">y</span> reports, although some of the months may consist of a limited “<span class="italic">flash”</span> forecast that focuses solely on revenue and operating profit rather than on a full-scale forecast that contains all of the income statement line items. It can be argued that monthly forecasts may be excessive—especially if much of the company's revenue is recorded in the last month of the quarter—and flash forecasts can provide a reasonable compromise for some of the periods.</p>
<p class="para">Another issue concerns the timing of the forecasts, with CEOs and business leaders typically wanting to receive information that is fully up-to-date as of the day they receive the report. However, this usually doesn't allow the finance professionals time to analyze the results and to recommend any corrective actions. Automating and simplifying the forecasting methodologies can mitigate the <span class="italic">speed versus analysis</span> issue, but there likely will always be a trade-off between the two objectives—a trade-off that seems to come with the territory.</p>
<p class="para">The best practice is to get the results out in a summary format and to be ready with details—unless it is a flash forecast—in response to questions. Another best practice is for CFOs to design forecasts that call attention to material variances from the budget—thereby facilitating quick responses—and to highlight the external as well as the company-specific factors that are significantly affecting the results.</p>
<p class="para">It is also helpful for CFOs to indicate the major changes from the prior forecast, thus providing a snapshot of whether conditions are trending better or worse. Many CFOs choose to color code this type of reporting.</p>
<p class="h2">Risks and Opportunities</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Forecasts typically represent point estimates rather than a range of potential results. Therefore, a best practice is for CFOs to summarize risks and opportunities that can affect the estimates. The <span class="italic">risks</span> typically can include potential revenue shortfalls, expense contingencies, or unfavorable movements in external variables such as currencies, while the <span class="italic">opportunities</span> are the converse, such as revenue upsides, expense reductions, and favorable currency movements.</p>
<p class="para">Some CFOs strive to have the risks <span class="italic">equal</span> the opportunities, thus having the net impact consistent with the official forecast. The other alternative is to have unequal risks and opportunities, thereby indicating whether there is an <span class="italic">asymmetric</span> probability that the actual results will exceed or fall short of the official forecast.</p>
<p class="h2">Rolling Quarterly Forecasts</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As another best practice, CFOs will regularly prepare rolling forecasts for the next four quarters. The advantages from this approach include:</p>
<ul>
<li>It reinforces the discipline of continuously revising assumptions and expectations in response to changing conditions.</li><li>It highlights seasonal or special conditions that apply to an upcoming quarter, causing it to veer from the trend lines.</li><li>It indicates the need for action steps in anticipation of potential shortfalls or other issues in the foreseeable future.</li><li>It facilitates the preparation of budgets, which can use the current rolling forecast as a starting point for analysis.</li></ul>

<p class="para">However, most companies are oriented toward an annual budgeting process and do not apply the same kind of rigor to their rolling forecasts, which easily can degenerate into mere extrapolations. Therefore, it is important for CFOs to emphasize the need for careful review of the assumptions, although recognizing that they may reflect more top down estimates than used in budget preparations.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c17-3">CASH FLOWS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Traditionally, most companies have been focused primarily on income statement projections in their budgeting and forecasting activities. This can result in a disconnect with their shareholders, who typically are highly interested in cash flow and balance sheet results.</p>
<p class="para">The owners of private companies—especially start-ups or highly leveraged businesses—are usually focused on cash flow due to their relatively high cost of capital and perhaps their limited access to short-term liquidity. And the shareholders of public companies usually use free cash flow as an important indicator in their stock price valuations.</p>
<p class="para">The typical explanation for a lesser focus on cash flow and balance sheet data is the lack of systems that can produce timely information. This may be a legitimate concern. However, if at all possible, CFOs should seek to improve their cash flow and balance sheet reporting and to require cash flows in their regular forecasts. In addition, the best practice is to include cash flow projections in the annual budgets, as well as to link them with incentive compensation objectives.</p>
<p class="para">In particular, business units should regularly budget and forecast their working capital and capital expenditure requirements.</p>
<p class="h2">Working Capital</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">By including working capital as a regular part of their budgeting and forecasting systems, CFOs can encourage greater management focus on potential action steps to enhance free cash flow. Otherwise, working capital projections can become an afterthought, perhaps extrapolated from recent trend lines, rather than line items that receive regular scrutiny.</p>
<p class="para">At a minimum, every forecast and budget should specifically include targets for accounts receivable, trade payables, and inventory.</p>
<p class="h2">Capital Expenditures</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Likewise, capital expenditures should be budgeted and forecasted regularly. First, this will ensure that project sponsors are focused on the total cash flow impact of their projects rather than on the amounts that are reflected in the income statement during the period. The cash outflow represents the true economic cost, irrespective of how much is capitalized versus the amount that is expensed.</p>
<p class="para">Second, capital expenditures are often an area where the actual cash spending falls short of the budgeted amounts—usually due to projects taking longer to implement than originally estimated. Project sponsors may be reluctant to forecast these shortfalls, fearing that they will be giving up the possibility of using the money as planned.</p>
<p class="para">If CFOs can encourage good faith assessments of the actual spending rates, this can result in better cash flow projections, which in turn can facilitate better capital allocation decisions.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c17-4">PERFORMANCE METRICS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Having established the company's strategic objectives and formulated a long-term financial model, CFOs should partner with the CEO and management team to determine the key financial and operational metrics that the financial organization will monitor on a regular basis. Depending on the metric, these key performance indicators typically will be updated and reviewed on a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis.</p>
<p class="para">In this way, the CFO can help ensure that the company is not only focusing on its current results, but also on the factors that will drive its results in the future—indicating areas where the company is performing well and creating an early warning system for potential problems. Also, the simple process of choosing and monitoring metrics will greatly influence behavior—presumably reinforcing the company's strategic priorities.</p>
<p class="h2">Number of Metrics</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">While there is no magic number concerning the number of metrics, the goal should be to identify the key performance indicators in a “<span class="italic">dashboard”</span> or “<span class="italic">scorecard</span>” that is regularly reviewed in management meetings. Generally, it is better to have fewer rather than more metrics, but to make more detailed metrics available as back-up information.</p>
<p class="para">The fewer the metrics, the more likely they will be treated as a top priority. Furthermore, having fewer metrics helps center the management reviews on potential responses to the information rather than on a recitation of data. The CFO should seek to identify the trends indicated by the metrics, determine what are likely to be the underlying causes for these trends, and recommend action steps to be analyzed and then implemented—preferably as soon as practicable.</p>
<p class="para">In most cases, companies will have a <span class="italic">hierarchy</span> of metrics that are used for alternative purposes. At the top of the hierarchy are metrics used by the board of directors in their review of executive compensation. The next level is metrics that are regularly reviewed by the CEO and the management team. And then there are the more specific and usually more numerous metrics that are monitored by the various business units and staff departments. The levels of metrics in this hierarchy should be linked to each other, as well as to the company's strategic objectives and long-term financial model.</p>
<p class="h2">Dashboard Format</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In designing their dashboard formats, some companies prefer graphs, while others prefer numerical data, or a combination of the two. Whatever the format, the important point is that the dashboard should be easily read and composed of metrics that the management team can directly influence. In other words, they should primarily reflect the key drivers of the company's business model—such as the acquisition, retention, and satisfaction of customers; revenue and product mix per customer; fixed and variable cost ratios; or employee headcounts—and not focused on exogenous variables that are outside of management's sphere of influence.</p>
<p class="para">Many companies like to use a green/yellow/red color code to highlight the status of the metrics against previously agreed benchmarks or targets. This is particularly useful when companies use a large number of metrics and need a vehicle for easily identifying the outliers.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should also be flexible with respect to the formats for ad hoc reports. The goal should be to communicate simply and effectively—based on the target audience and the purpose for the report—and to avoid an excess of superfluous information.</p>
<p class="h2">Financial Metrics</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Of course, financial metrics typically will form the core of the dashboard. However, CFOs should resist the temptation to include a vast number of financial metrics—essentially replicating the financial statements. Instead, they should focus on the key drivers of the stock price.</p>
<p class="para">The CFO should selectively focus on the most salient measurements, with the knowledge that more detailed information is available to expand the analysis of financial results. In particular, they should include metrics that are used in the CEO's incentive compensation and the metrics that have been identified as performance drivers in the strategic plan.</p>
<p class="h2">Non-Financial Metrics</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should also focus on non-financial metrics that are the underlying drivers of financial performance. Because of the intrinsic differences among industries and in light of the variety of business strategies that may be pursued, these non-financial metrics can reflect a wide gamut of possibilities. Some examples include:</p>
<p class="listhead"><span class="bold">Operational Metrics</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Safety incidents or lost-time workplace accidents</li><li>Waste percentages or other quality measures</li><li>Capacity utilization or production statistics</li><li>Network down times or service failures</li><li>Sustainability metrics and ratings</li></ul>

<p class="listhead"><span class="bold">Customer Metrics</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Number of customers or accounts</li><li>Customer satisfaction surveys</li><li>Number of products per customer</li><li>Revenue per customer or account</li></ul>

<p class="listhead"><span class="bold">Employee Metrics</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue per employee</li><li>Total or change in headcount</li><li>Scores in “engagement” surveys</li><li>Voluntary turnover percentages</li><li>Diversity percentages or totals</li><li>Percentage of temporary employees</li></ul>

<p class="listhead"><span class="bold">Innovation Metrics</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Patents or copyrights received</li><li>Number of new products launched</li><li>Ratings from industry analysts</li></ul>

<p class="listhead"><span class="bold">Marketing Metrics</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Market shares for key products</li><li>Brand awareness surveys</li><li>Unique visitors to website</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Continuity</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should encourage continuity in the performance metrics that are included in the company's dashboard, with the bulk of the metrics being consistent from one year to the next. This reinforces a focus on long-term as well as short-term action plans.</p>
<p class="para">They also should seek clarity and consistency in the definitions of the metrics. This will limit any ambiguity in measuring the company's progress against its targets.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c17-5">BUSINESS UNIT METRICS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The performance metrics for the business units usually will reflect subsets of the corporate metrics and specific metrics that apply uniquely to them. In other words, their performance metrics will be a combination that represents both the company's overall strategic objectives and their particular business strategies.</p>
<p class="para">In evaluating business unit financial performance, CFOs normally use <span class="italic">net operating</span> <span class="italic">profit after-tax (NOPAT)</span> as the primary measurement. Many CFOs also add a capital charge based on the business unit's net assets to compute its <span class="italic">economic profit</span> or <span class="italic">economic value added (EVA).</span> The capital charge is normally equal to the company's weighted-average cost of capital.</p>
<p class="para">EVA is a concept that was popularized by the consulting firm Stern Stewart. In addition to applying a cost of capital to the business unit results, CFOs using EVA also may adjust the results to reflect the long-term economics of certain expenditures. For example, they may capitalize and amortize research and development spending or marketing and advertising investments.</p>
<p class="para">In some industries, CFOs evaluate the business units by their <span class="italic">EBITDA,</span> especially if cash generation is a primary determinant of shareholder value. Increasingly, CFOs also are measuring <span class="italic">free cash flow,</span> which highlights which business units are generating cash versus the business units that are net consumers of cash.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs typically exclude the effects of currency movements in measuring business unit results and may exclude the impact of new acquisitions and divestitures, as well as certain expenses such as restructuring charges, litigation settlements, or significant asset write-offs that are deemed to be corporate, rather than business unit, decisions.</p>
<p class="para">The CFO's challenges are to ensure that the business unit measures are incentivizing management in positive ways, that the measures are consistently applied throughout the company's operations, and that the methodologies support the company's overarching goal of creating shareholder value. They also should use measures that are easily understood by the business leaders, who may have limited backgrounds in finance and accounting.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c17-6">PERFORMANCE REPORTS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The typical routine in most companies is for the financial organization to produce monthly reports that show how the business performance compares with the budget and the most recent forecast. In producing these reports, the primary emphasis usually is on timely reporting rather than on thorough analysis; receiving the information quickly is normally the business leaders' first priority, with the analysis to follow.</p>
<p class="para">The reports usually consist of the actual financial results for each profit and cost center, along with a simple variance analysis for each line item against the budget, forecast, and prior period (usually the same month in the prior year). The reports typically will also show the quarter-to-date and year-to-date comparisons.</p>
<p class="para">These reports are normally fairly detailed; thus CFOs typically will design a method for highlighting the material variances—often through a color-coded scheme. This facilitates prompt identification of key issues, usually leading to requests for additional data and analysis concerning the factors that underlie the variances. The paramount objective is to determine whether any shortfalls are caused by factors under management's control and to take action steps to rectify the issues.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, the reports usually will include an update of the company's performance metrics. And as a best practice, they will show the company's progress against the targets that have been established for incentive compensation.</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>

<p class="h1" id="c17-7">BUSINESS ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In addition to the business support that is regularly provided through budgets, forecasts, and performance reports, CFOs will become involved with specific business issues—usually involving potential action steps to increase revenue or reduce costs.</p>
<p class="para">To a large extent, CFOs typically will be responding to requests that are made by the business units or reacting to issues or opportunities that have arisen through the performance reports. In addition, they can initiate activities in support of the business objectives. For example, they can focus resources, review cost accounting assumptions, and sponsor “deep dive” reviews.</p>
<p class="h2">Focused Resources</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In essence, CFOs have the mandate to serve their business clients effectively and efficiently—producing information and analysis that is easily understood, focused on the essential facts, and presented in a manner that can lead to concrete action steps. Put simply, an analysis is only worthwhile if it is valued and used by the CFO's business clients; otherwise, it can become a report that is generated routinely, but which has limited utility in comparison with alternative priorities for the financial organization.</p>
<p class="para">Consistent with this mandate, CFOs should strive to eliminate unnecessary reports. An effective technique used by many CFOs is to suspend the production of some reports on a regular basis, thus ascertaining whether there is sufficient demand to have them reinstated. Often the reports are not missed at all.</p>
<p class="para">The systematic process of culling unnecessary reports is particularly effective when there has been a change in leadership within a business unit. Each leader will tend to focus on different performance metrics and unless the financial organization makes a concerted effort to eliminate some of the old reports, it will be challenged to meet both the old and the new reporting requirements—leaving little time to perform value added business analysis.</p>
<p class="para">Likewise, the financial organization needs to be judicious in agreeing to tailor reports for the particular preferences of each line manager. CFOs should encourage as much standardization as possible; otherwise, the financial organization can be overwhelmed by requests for bespoke formats, which can cause quality and productivity to deteriorate.</p>
<p class="para">In other words, providing good client service doesn't mean that CFOs need to comply with every business unit request. Instead, it is generally healthy to encourage creative tension between the providers and the users of the analytical information.</p>
<p class="para">The bottom line is that CFOs can provide more and better business support if they can redirect and concentrate existing resources.</p>
<p class="h2">Cost Accounting</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Of course, cost accounting is fundamental to much business analysis, especially the calculation of profitability by product line or customer. CFOs should periodically review the assumptions that drive these calculations—including the allocations of revenue and costs among products and customers—and ensure that they are providing fair representations of the marginal economics.</p>
<p class="para">Because extremely detailed assumptions often are hard-wired into their cost accounting systems, CFOs may want to take a conceptual, rather than a detailed approach from time to time—reviewing the way the formulas are constructed. In some cases, it may be useful for the CFO to make some back-of-the envelope calculations that are admittedly less precise than the computer-generated reports, but which may offer business insights due to the simplified approach and the focus on a few key variables.</p>
<p class="h2">Deep Dives</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As a final example, CFOs can sponsor a deep dive review of a particular topic, giving finance professionals the chance to analyze a high impact issue and testing their potential to add greater value to the company's business objectives. Unfortunately, these opportunities may not arise naturally due to the exigencies of daily responsibilities. Therefore, CFOs will often need to take proactive steps to help make this happen.</p>
<p class="para">For example, the CFO can partner with a business leader in sponsoring reviews of product line profit margins, cost comparisons against competitor benchmarks, pricing strategies for different customer segments, or potential investments in marketing or sales incentive programs. This gives the finance professionals a chance to step back from their daily routines and to make a value enhancing contribution to the business strategies.</p>
<p class="para">In some cases, CFOs may want to engage consultants to assist with a deep dive; they can provide impetus to the project, offer fresh perspectives, bring specialized expertise, and share best practices from their other clients. However, CFOs usually will want to explicitly define the extent of their engagement—avoiding scope creep—and center the project on specific business issues rather than on broad industry studies.</p>
