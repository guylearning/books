<p class="paraaftertitle"> It's also indisputable that the CFO's roles are expanding: as new responsibilities are added, the previous responsibilities don't go away. And the CFO usually is expected to take on these additional duties while continuously reducing the finance organization's headcount and cost structure.</p>
<p class="para">Deloitte addressed the challenges for CFOs in managing their expanding scope of responsibilities in a posting on its CFO Learning Center website. It described the “four faces” of a CFO's time allocation—Strategist, Catalyst, Steward, and Operator—and compared the desired allocation—as indicated by a survey among CFOs—with the amount of time that actually is allocated to each of these four roles. Deloitte concluded that “while CFOs desire to spend 60 percent of their time as a Strategist or Catalyst, in reality they average only 42 percent of their time in these roles.”<a id="int-not-0006-1" href="int-5.htm#int-not-0006"><span class="superscript">6</span></a></p>
<p class="para">As indicated by Deloitte's analysis, while being a Strategist or Catalyst may be their preferred vehicles for adding value, CFOs nevertheless must be continuously focused on all of the other responsibilities that come with the job. It's analogous to a figure skater who executes a triple axel to compete for a gold medal, but who must also spend countless hours in perfecting the less glamorous compulsories that constitute much of the judges' scoring.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs must focus on several things at once and respond appropriately to the priorities of the moment. In the real world, it's hard to perform as a Strategic CFO in the face of an accounting restatement, a controls breakdown, or a liquidity crisis. In addition, their emphasis will reflect the talents of their team, since no CFO can do everything alone and the team inevitably will comprise complementary strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, it's worth emphasizing that the CFO's roles are still evolving. For example, CFOs have been taking a more prominent role with the financial media, helping to satisfy the insatiable appetite of broadcasters and websites for 24/7 content. Although it's unlikely that the job will evolve into the “Telegenic” CFO, it does seem inevitable that media relations will become a growing priority for the future.</p>
