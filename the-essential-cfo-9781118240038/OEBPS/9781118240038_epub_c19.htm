<p class="chaptertitle">Chapter Nineteen</p>
<p class="chaptertitle">Establishing Accounting Processes</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CFO role is the natural rhythm that results from the schedule for producing financial reports. Typically, the financial organization is producing financial statements on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis, along with comparisons against prior periods, budgets, and forecasts.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c19-1">FINANCIAL REPORTING</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For CFOs, the regularity of the financial reporting schedule is both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, the relentless reporting requirements represent a series of challenges, with more downside than upside for the typical CFO. The financial organization performs repetitive and laborious reviews and reconciliations involving a multitude of schedules and balances, while often coping with system or staffing limitations.</p>
<p class="para">On the other hand, the reporting schedule ensures that CFOs stay up-to-date on the company's current financial condition and facilitates informed communications with the CEO, the management team, the board of directors, and investors. It also provides the basis for in-depth reviews of financial trends and affords the opportunity to make mid-course corrections.</p>
<p class="h2">Accurate and Timely</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The CFO's paramount objective in establishing financial reporting processes is to produce <span class="italic">accurate</span> financial statements in a <span class="italic">timely</span> manner. In many companies, accomplishing this objective requires heroic acts by controllers and financial managers as they endure rituals of long hours and often frenetic activity to produce reliable financial reports within a rigidly compressed time frame.</p>
<p class="para">Given the regularity of the reporting schedule, companies may have a tendency to take their processes for granted. However, they can be quite complex, usually involving numerous judgments, substantial data manipulation, and intensive coordination among a number of people in disparate roles and possibly remote locations.</p>
<p class="para">There are many opportunities for things to go wrong—including the possibility of a restatement of prior results, which is every CFO's worst nightmare, especially in today's unforgiving environment. To err may be human, but it is certainly not good accounting or reporting.</p>
<p class="h2">Closing Cycle</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs are of two minds concerning the desirability of shortening the closing cycle. They fear that reducing the time period can be counterproductive, increasing the odds of errors and reworks. However, they also recognize that imposing a shorter time frame can actually be beneficial to the integrity of a company's financial reporting—providing the impetus to reengineer procedures and justifying greater investments in technology tools.</p>
<p class="para">Change is good, but it is also hard, especially in the midst of reporting deadlines that are arriving with relentless regularity. Therefore, a CFO usually must provide strong top down support in order to implement improvements in the reporting processes.</p>
<p class="para">And they must take some risks. Otherwise, inertia is likely to sustain the status quo.</p>
<p class="h2">Automation</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In driving improved processes, automation can be the CFO's best friend. Automation of accounting processes prevents errors from occurring in the first place, significantly increases the odds of catching errors that do occur, and produces timelier reporting. In contrast, if a report is being prepared offline on an Excel spreadsheet, there's a good chance that something can go wrong—if not immediately, then possibly when there is staff turnover or if functions are shifted to a new location. The CFO's core principle should be clear: Wherever possible, processes should be automated, eliminating the need for human intervention and the risk of human error. CFOs should continuously reinforce this objective throughout their financial organizations and should insist on information technology controls that can reliably support the automated processes.</p>
<p class="h2">Technology Tools</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Going hand in hand with automation is the value to be obtained from technology tools. These tools can include comprehensive enterprise resource planning software that links the financial functions throughout the company, including controls that can prevent errors from occurring. They can also include software that consolidates financial reporting from disparate systems, improves accounts payable and procurement processes, or performs specific tasks, such as tax reporting.</p>
<p class="para">Implementing these tools typically is extremely difficult—with the need to undo the manual processes and compensatory habits that have been ingrained over time—and their cost can often be hard to justify by the usual measures such as return on investment. However, most CFOs have concluded that automating their processes and adding new software tools are justified by the potential benefits to be derived—especially the reduction of risk in a challenging financial reporting environment.</p>
<p class="para">In driving these improvements, their watchwords are “<span class="italic">incrementally</span>” and “c<span class="italic">ontinuously.”</span></p>
<p class="h2">Documentation</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">One of the positive outcomes from Sarbanes-Oxley (yes, there are some benefits!) is the greater emphasis on documenting financial procedures and judgments. This documentation has helped to ensure consistency of methodologies and has facilitated the transfer of knowledge among finance professionals, especially in the face of employee turnover and relocations of functions.</p>
<p class="para">Having gone through the initial rigors of complying with Sarbanes-Oxley, CFOs are now reinforcing this best practice by thoroughly documenting all of their processes—not just the ones subject to annual testing—and discouraging any reliance on employee knowhow in their work flows. For all CFOs, the lesson should be clear: Although time consuming and tedious, documentation is well worth the effort.</p>
<p class="h2">Checks and Balances</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Of course, no matter how automated and technologically advanced, a company's processes are still going to be subject to some human error and will be vulnerable to their weakest links. Therefore, CFOs must rely on their controllers and financial managers to build in procedures to review work products at various stages of their development. This is one of the chief benefits of investing in automation and technology tools; it allows more time for reviews to be performed, shifting the emphasis from data production to thoughtful analysis.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, it is better to do it right the first time, but catching an error certainly is the second best alternative. Given the CFO's goal of error-free accuracy, it is comforting to know that there are some additional procedures to double check the results.</p>
<p class="para">A few other observations about instituting checks and balances are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Common Sense:</span> It helps to reserve some time for review and reflection, whereby the accounting professionals can consider the reasonableness and logic of the numbers, applying common sense judgments to the reported results. </li><li><span class="bold">Technology Tools:</span> The investment in technology tools can facilitate the detection of errors (e.g., they typically can detect mismatched or duplicate entries).</li><li><span class="bold">Chart of Accounts:</span> A standardized and simplified chart of accounts can help to avoid inconsistent treatment of accounting entries.</li><li><span class="bold">Centers of Excellence:</span> Having regional or company-wide accounting functions in the same location can foster timely communications (e.g., they can facilitate intercompany reconciliations).</li><li><span class="bold">External Auditors:</span> Do not rely on the external auditors to catch errors; while CFOs can take some comfort that the external auditors will review and sample test for material errors, they should recognize that the company retains the primary responsibility for producing accurate financial reports.</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Good People</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">It is worth emphasizing that good people are fundamental to timely and accurate reporting processes; attracting and retaining high-quality, well-trained accounting professionals should be a top-of-mind priority for most CFOs. Turnover generally has lessened in recent years due to the slowdown in the economy, but the wars for financial talent are likely to resume as the economy recovers. Indeed, the quest for a well-trained and motivated work force has been a primary impetus for CFOs to consider outsourcing some of their accounting and processing functions.</p>
<p class="para">Accounting firms traditionally have been the predominant breeding grounds for financial talent, reflecting their superb training programs and their on-the-ground exposures to a variety of companies and geographies. However, given the proliferation of regulatory measures and new accounting rules, the accounting firms—as well as the burgeoning regulatory agencies—have been expanding their staffing needs, creating greater competition for experienced accountants. Eventually, this imbalance should rectify itself, but staffing may represent a challenge for some time to come.</p>
<p class="h2">Tax Accounting</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Tax accounting is an area that deserves special focus. In many companies—especially those with multinational locations—much of the emphasis has been on sophisticated tax planning. However, with the advent of the Sarbanes-Oxley requirements and the adoption of new accounting standards for tax disclosures, the financial reporting responsibilities within tax departments have become much more important. This has created management challenges and has caused stress in accounting systems that may be inadequate for the tasks at hand.</p>
<p class="para">In response, CFOs have been improving the management processes in their tax departments, with more focus on automation, standardization, and documentation. They have also been enhancing the speed and accuracy of their tax information flows—including more timely information from international locations. In many cases, CFOs have invested in new software tools to expedite their tax accounting processes, resulting in dramatically improved capabilities to meet the higher standards now required.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c19-2">SEC FILINGS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For public companies, the reporting schedules provide the raw material for complying with the numerous regulatory requirements, including the inexorable promulgation of new or revised governmental and accounting rules. And for both public and private companies, they provide the vehicles for vibrant communications with investors, who have seemingly inexhaustible appetites for more information and analysis.</p>
<p class="para">Companies that are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act) center their reporting schedules around the timing and disclosure requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The most important are the 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings, as well as the DEF14A annual proxy filing.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should partner closely with the general counsel and the company's legal team—as well as any outside counsel who are retained for SEC matters—in ensuring that they are fully aware of the current requirements and allowing adequate time to prepare and review the contents of the filings.</p>
<p class="h2">Disclosure Requirements</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Large registered companies must file 10-Qs with the SEC within 40 days after the end of each fiscal quarter (within 45 days for smaller companies) and the 10-K within 60 days after the end of their fiscal year (within 75 or 90 days for smaller companies). These deadlines have been accelerated in recent years, giving CFOs less leeway in completing their financial statements, securing the necessary sign offs from their external auditors and legal advisors, and receiving the requisite approval from the audit committee.</p>
<p class="para">Generally, companies will impose “<span class="italic">blackout periods</span>” that begin midway through the third month of each quarter and last through the earnings announcement. These blackout periods restrict transactions in the company's stock by “insiders,” who include executive officers, the board of directors, and owners of greater than 10 percent of the company's shares. However, transactions can still be made pursuant to a 10b-5(1) program through which stock is purchased or sold automatically, according to a predetermined schedule.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, companies are required to file 8-Ks within four business days after specified events, such as a financial announcement, a strategic transaction, a major contract signing or completion, or a change in an executive officer or member of the board of directors. This requirement is supplementary to a company's general requirement under 10b-5 of the 1934 Act to disclose material information to the market.</p>
<p class="h2">XBRL Mandate</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Since 1993, the SEC has required electronic filings to be made through “EDGAR,” its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system. However, the SEC plans to supplement EDGAR with uses of interactive data and eventually replace EDGAR with the Interactive Data Electronic Applications (IDEA) system.</p>
<p class="para">As part of this initiative, the SEC now requires filings to be made using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) software. This software facilitates the extraction of information from the filings and makes it easier for stock market analysts to make comparisons among companies.</p>
<p class="para">XBRL provides a computer-readable identifier for each item of data. According to the SEC's announcement of the new mandate, interactive data using the XBRL language “can create new ways for investors, analysts, and others to retrieve and use financial information in documents filed with us. For example, users of financial information will be able to download it directly into spreadsheets, analyze it using commercial off-the-shelf software, or use it within investment models in other software formats.”<a id="c19-not-0001-1" href="#c19-not-0001"><span class="superscript">1</span></a></p>
<p class="h2">Plain English</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In addition to shortening the time frames for filings, the SEC has been requiring additional information in the management discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A) and specifying that the disclosures be written in “plain English,” which generally means using the active rather than the passive voice and writing in straightforward prose. For example, instead of “It is expected that raw material prices will be under pressure,” a plain English sentence would read “We expect that our raw material prices will increase.”</p>
<p class="para">The SEC's requirements—along with investors' desire for more analytical information—have caused CFOs to focus more on the clarity of their MD&amp;A and other disclosures, including the description of the company's strategies and competitive positioning. It has also motivated accounting professionals to sharpen their writing skills.</p>
<p class="h2">Risk Factors</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Consistent with their greater emphasis on enterprise risk management programs, CFOs are also focusing on the “risk factors” that are required in the 10-K. Companies generally are adding more discussion of risks, erring generally on the side of disclosing more, rather than fewer, risk factors.</p>
<p class="para">This additional disclosure does not seem to faze investors, who recognize that companies are inevitably exposed to several risk areas; however, they appreciate reassurances that management and the board of directors are focused on the appropriate strategies for accepting or mitigating these risks.</p>
<p class="h2">Tax Disclosures</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Taxes are another source of increased disclosure requirements. In particular, the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) in 2006 and subsequent accounting changes have demonstrably increased the amount of information provided to investors, including a summary of the company's unrecognized tax benefits.</p>
<p class="para">In the past, tax professionals generally argued against disclosing information because of the potential impact on future tax audits; they felt that the disclosures could provide a road map to the tax auditors, which would compromise their ability to negotiate a favorable settlement. However, their concerns have been overruled by FIN 48 and the other new requirements that have mandated more disclosure.</p>
<p class="para">Given the greater transparency in their financial statements, CFOs must now be fully prepared to explain their company's tax status to investors. Furthermore, many audit committees are reviewing tax-related contingencies with more regularity and in greater detail than previously.</p>
<p class="h2">Fair Values</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The accounting rules and financial reporting requirements clearly are trending toward more “fair value” disclosures—providing more information on the market values of assets and liabilities. Notable examples in recent years include fair value determinations related to investments, debt obligations, and pension funds. In addition, goodwill and intangibles are subject to market tests.</p>
<p class="para">This movement toward fair value accounting is likely to persist, especially given the plan to converge GAAP with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). As a result, financial reports are likely to become more volatile, which will create additional accounting and communication challenges for CFOs.</p>
<p class="para">Given these trends, CFOs need to establish appropriate and consistent methodologies for performing these market valuations, in some cases supplementing their internal reviews with third-party validations.</p>
<p class="h2">Proxy Filings</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another trend worth noting is the increased disclosure in annual proxy statements concerning executive pay, including the compensation discussion and analysis (CD&amp;A). As a result, CFOs have been assuming greater roles in the preparation of the annual proxy filings, especially the computation and presentation of the metrics used in executive compensation programs.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c19-3">EXTERNAL AUDITORS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given the stricter regulatory environment, obtaining timely completions of the external auditors' reviews can be a potential stumbling block in preparing SEC filings; indeed, it is not uncommon for the external auditors to request revisions to the financial statements in the time period between the company's earnings announcement and filing its 10-Q or 10-K with the SEC.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs often lament that their external auditors can bring up new items at the last minute and that their engagement team must obtain input and approvals from their national office. Without question, the more demanding regulatory climate has caused greater oversight from the national offices, which can be frustrating for all concerned. As a result, there is more uncertainty concerning accounting judgments and more time is required to obtain them.</p>
<p class="para">At the same time, the external auditors often cite the failure of their clients to get their work papers and draft materials to them on a timely basis. Indeed, the new regulations have caused many companies to be more circumspect in sharing early drafts with their auditors. The engagement team has a lot of hoops to get through each quarter and they often feel pressured from too little time to address potential accounting issues.</p>
<p class="para">Suffice it to say that the overall process of preparing and approving the financial statements has become more difficult, requiring greater coordination between CFOs and their auditors' engagement partners. In response, CFOs should consider action steps to streamline the communications and avoid last minute surprises.</p>
<p class="para">For example, the CFO can request that the external auditor provide a memorandum midway through each quarter to highlight potential issues in that quarter's financial statements. This memorandum can then serve as the agenda for a meeting with the CFO and corporate controller to discuss the issues and to determine what can be done to expedite their resolution—presumably well in advance of the filing deadline!</p>
<p class="para">In general, CFOs should seek to forge a constructive and productive relationship with the lead partner on their account, identifying potential ways to streamline communications and expedite the work flow.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c19-4">AUDIT COMMITTEE</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs will also want to ensure that they keep the audit committee up to date on their financial reporting policies and potential accounting issues. By regularly reviewing their key accounting policies and procedures, they can reduce the risk that the committee will feel pressured to approve the filings without sufficient time to review the numbers and the accounting judgments that underpin them.</p>
<p class="para">In particular, CFOs can partner with the chair of the audit committee to schedule agenda items that will educate the committee concerning the company's significant accounting policies. For example, they can schedule reviews of items such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="italic">Reserves,</span> including those pertaining to the tax provision, litigation exposures, and bad debts.</li><li><span class="italic">Intangibles,</span> including the balance sheet entries for goodwill, as well as the amortizing balances for intangibles such as customer relationships, technology systems, and internally developed software.</li><li><span class="italic">Revenue Recognition,</span> including bundled products and services and long-term contracts.</li><li><span class="italic">Fair Values,</span> including the methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the market values of assets and liabilities.</li></ul>

<p class="para">Furthermore, they should make the audit committee aware of their rationales for selecting specific accounting policies where different alternatives were evaluated. The external auditors are required to discuss these alternative accounting policies with the audit committee and it helps if the committee members have a prior understanding of the reasons behind the company's choice of its accounting methodologies.</p>
