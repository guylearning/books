<p class="chaptertitle">Chapter Fourteen</p>
<p class="chaptertitle">Ensuring  Short-Term Liquidity</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">IN EXECUTING THEIR CAPITAL STRUCTURE STRATEGIES, CFOs should be hyper-vigilant in ensuring that the company maintains adequate and reliable access to liquidity. They should seek to guarantee the availability of cash under almost all circumstances—including unforeseen or even unprecedented dislocations in the financial markets.</p>
<p class="para">To satisfy their needs for liquidity, CFOs may advocate maintaining a larger cash balance than needed to run the business. They should also develop contingency plans to obtain short-term funding in the event of either exogenous forces that can curtail access to the capital markets or company-specific issues that can cause sudden and unpredictable requirements for cash.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c14-1">BANK LINES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For almost all companies—including nonprofits—their planning for liquidity typically involves arranging lines of credit from banks or other financial services companies. The short-term sources of credit can take various forms, such as banker's acceptances, warehouse financing, floor planning, and credit cards. Larger companies with strong credit ratings can also tap the commercial paper market, which can provide short-term unsecured financing at attractive rates.</p>
<p class="para">However, as the mainstays of their financial planning, CFOs typically will arrange <span class="italic">revolving credit lines</span> that can fund the company's operating activities and back up their other funding sources, such as commercial paper financings. These lines can be unsecured or secured by assets such as receivables and inventories.</p>
<p class="h2">Banking Relationships</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Given the importance of bank credit commitments in meeting their liquidity needs, CFOs appreciate the need to cultivate strong relationships with their banks—keeping them informed about the company's financial results, sharing short- and long-term financial projections, generally avoiding surprises, and establishing personal bonds based on mutual trust and respect for one another. However, one of the harsh lessons from the financial crisis is that CFOs should not rely too much on either personal or institutional relationships with their banks.</p>
<p class="para">As evidenced during the crisis, if banks are dealing with their own liquidity and survival issues, they inevitably will be rationing their customers' access to credit—and will be doing so based on cold-hearted assessments of the customer's profitability to the bank and its perceived ability to repay any loans. Relationships simply are not going to outweigh the banks' objective judgments concerning the commercial arrangements. Or as Donald Trump would say, it's business, not personal.</p>
<p class="para"> In addition, CFOs should be sure to diversify their banking relationships, thus affording access to credit from alternative sources and making them less vulnerable to a particular bank's financial condition and lending policies.</p>
<p class="h2">Contractual Commitments</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should establish contractual commitments from their banks that are as iron-clad as possible, providing financing in almost any conceivable—or even seemingly inconceivable—circumstances. In particular, the CFO should ensure that the company's general counsel carefully reviews the credit facilities to confirm their validity in times of duress. Otherwise, if the bank's commitment has too many exclusions, the facility may be inoperable at the very time when it's needed most.</p>
<p class="para">Achieving greater certainty of receiving funding may require the CFO to pay a higher commitment fee to the bank, but this trade-off probably is worth making in a volatile world.</p>
<p class="para">At the same time, CFOs may want to establish commitments with more than one bank, thereby securing access to credit from alternative sources and more flexibility to switch services if a bank encounters difficulties.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c14-2">CASH PLANNING</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another critical task for CFOs is to institute rigorous cash planning practices, including regular forecasts of their projected short- and long-term liquidity requirements. This means analyzing and managing both expected and potential cash uses, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Seasonality of Revenue:</span> Projecting the seasonality of the sales cycles and calculating the time required to convert these sales into cash.</li><li><span class="bold">Inventory Levels:</span> Given the forecasted sales cycles, estimating the requirements for work-in-process and finished goods inventory.</li><li><span class="bold">Trade Payables:</span> Estimating the flows of trade payables given the inventory requirements.</li><li><span class="bold">Major Payables:</span> Anticipating major cash outlays such as tax payments, management and employee bonuses, pension fund contributions, dividend payments, share repurchases, interest payments, or litigation settlements.</li><li><span class="bold">Capital Expenditures:</span> Forecasting the spending plans for major capital expenditures.</li><li><span class="bold">Debt Maturities:</span> Planning for the maturities of debt securities and perhaps arranging new financings in advance of the scheduled maturities.</li><li><span class="bold">Strategic Transactions:</span> Considering cash sources and uses from pending acquisitions or divestitures, including any contingent payments such as earnouts.</li><li>Cash Repatriations: Estimating potential dividends or other cash payments from international subsidiaries.</li></ul>

<p class="para">In addition to preparing baseline cash forecasts, CFOs should consider the sensitivities of their cash flows to sales levels that are much higher or lower than forecasted. They should also supplement their regular cash planning exercises from time to time with contingency plans that prepare for a potential liquidity crisis.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c14-3">CONTINGENCY PLANNING</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">While it is virtually impossible to anticipate every possible scenario or set of circumstances, some advance contingency planning is likely to be a valuable exercise for CFOs to pursue, helping them to understand their various options in an emergency and—it is hoped—instilling confidence in their ability to manage through a liquidity shortfall.</p>
<p class="para">In particular, CFOs should stress test their cash requirements for either business issues—such as a disruption in supplier arrangements—or system-wide issues—such as a financial market shutdown—that can cause an unforeseen cash shortfall.</p>
<p class="h2">Mitigation Strategies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">To a large extent, CFOs' risk assessments will reflect their company's business profile and relative credit strength. Their company's characteristics will also greatly influence their choices among mitigation strategies.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs of large, creditworthy companies typically will confirm that they are not too reliant on sources of short-term funding—such as commercial paper—that are vulnerable to market dislocations. Furthermore, they will seek to ensure that they have sufficient back-up credit facilities—even if it results in higher annual commitment fees. They will also monitor their counterparty exposures in swaps or other derivative contracts.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs of smaller, less creditworthy companies will consider various methods of offsetting their liquidity risks, ranging from maintaining “rainy day” funds; to obtaining additional credit lines; to identifying possible short-term cash preservation strategies, such as factoring of receivables, suspending payments to suppliers or employees, or deferring investments in fixed assets.</p>
<p class="para">Bank CFOs usually will have access to funding through repurchase agreements and the Federal Reserve's discount window (or a similar arrangement for non-U.S. banks). Consequently, their primary focus may be to ensure that the bank is complying with all of its regulatory  requirements—thereby continuing its access to the governmental facilities—and that its reputation remains beyond reproach—thus ensuring continuity in its customer deposits. They will also closely monitor their exposure to counterparty arrangements that can become vulnerable due to contagion from failures by other institutions.</p>
<p class="para">As a best practice, CFOs should consider, in advance, all of their potential levers to avert a liquidity crisis that otherwise could cause irreparable damage to their company's reputation and credit standing—or even threaten its viability as a going concern. This planning exercise may reinforce their comfort with their status quo arrangements, but it also may indicate supplemental actions—such as increasing bank credit facilities—that should be pursued with alacrity.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c14-4">LIQUIDITY RATIOS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As one of their ongoing responsibilities, CFOs routinely monitor various liquidity ratios to determine the status of their company's cash position and to measure their progress against working capital objectives. Liquidity ratios can provide early warnings of issues and can highlight areas where corrective actions should be taken. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Current Ratio</span>: Current assets divided by current liabilities.</li><li><span class="bold">Quick (Acid-Test) Ratio:</span> Cash and equivalents plus accounts receivable divided by current liabilities.</li><li><span class="bold">Working Capital Ratio:</span> Cash and equivalents plus accounts receivable and inventory less payables divided by revenue.</li><li><span class="bold">Days of Sales Outstanding:</span> Accounts receivable divided by average daily revenue.</li><li><span class="bold">Inventory Turnover:</span> Cost of goods sold divided by inventory (on a first in first out [FIFO] basis).</li><li><span class="bold">Days of Payables Outstanding:</span> Trade payables divided by average daily purchases.</li></ul>

<p class="h1" id="c14-5">WORKING CAPITAL STRATEGIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Besides monitoring the ratios, CFOs can make meaningful impacts through their working capital strategies, which can reduce costs and serve as valuable weapons in their arsenal of liquidity protections.</p>
<p class="h2">Management Incentives</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The most important tool in working capital management is to establish incentives for the business leaders to focus on cash flows. Too often bonus plans are based solely on accounting criteria (such as net operating profit after tax) and do not incorporate explicit targets for cash flow management.</p>
<p class="para">By including cash flow objectives in the incentive plans—either a free cash flow target or a specific target for working capital—CFOs can enlist the full cooperation and support of the business units.</p>
<p class="h2">Accounts Payable</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Because accounts payable systems are often automated to pay suppliers at designated time intervals, they may be paying some bills earlier than necessary. CFOs may be able to preserve cash by applying more discretion in varying the payment schedules, distinguishing between the criticality of suppliers and their tolerances for days past due. And, of course, there is the age-old practice of disbursing checks from remote locations.</p>
<p class="para">Paying suppliers early to receive a price discount can be a good economic decision, but only if the size of the discount exceeds the company's cost of debt and the company has sufficient liquidity to make the payments. CFOs should recognize that procurement departments may be motivated to obtain these discounts—which typically count toward their cost savings objectives—and confirm that they make economic sense. In any event, the discounts may need to be foregone if the company needs the liquidity.</p>
<p class="h2">Accounts Receivable</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The personal involvement of CFOs can often make a big difference in collecting accounts receivable that are past due. They can directly encourage customers to make more timely payments, which in addition to reducing days of sales outstanding, can lower bad debt reserves and write-offs. They can also outsource collections for a contingent fee.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, CFOs can institute automated payment systems with customers, thereby facilitating prompt payments and reducing billing discrepancies. Another strategy is regularly to review lockbox configurations because postal services are constantly changing their delivery routes.</p>
<p class="para">In a mirror image of their analysis of purchasing discounts, CFOs can help determine whether a company should offer discounts to customers for early payments. This can be an economically viable alternative so long as the cost of the discount paid is less than the company's after-tax cost of capital for that period. It also should be considered if the company is strapped for cash.</p>
<p class="h2">Sales Commissions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another technique is to base the payments of sales commissions on the receipt of payments from customers, rather than when the sales are booked. This gives sales people a stake in collections and credit decisions, although it can be argued that it may divert them from making additional sales.</p>
<p class="h2">Inventories</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can analyze whether the inventories of finished goods can be reduced or even eliminated for slower moving items. They can help weigh the financial trade-offs between the cash freed up from eliminating an item versus the potential for lost revenue.</p>
<p class="para">They can also propose greater use of just-in-time arrangements with suppliers, thus reducing work-in-process inventories. Given their role in enterprise risk management, CFOs are well-positioned to assess the cash flow benefits in relation to the risks of supply chain disruptions and can help ensure that there are appropriate back-up arrangements.</p>
<p class="h2">Spare Parts</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs can analyze the possibility of discontinuing spare parts for obsolete or low volume products. Also, they can review whether spare parts storage can be consolidated into fewer facilities.</p>
<p class="h2">Cash Management</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">By centralizing a company's banking arrangements into one or a few banks, CFOs can establish more efficient systems for collecting and investing cash flows each day. In addition, they can establish policies for investing surplus cash that ensures immediate access to a portion of the funds in the event of an emergency. This typically involves sacrificing some yield for the enhanced liquidity.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c14-6">TRAPPED CASH</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">For U.S. companies with international operations, access to non-U.S. cash balances may be constrained by tax considerations. Given that the United States has a global rather than a territorial tax system and because most international income is taxed at lower rates than 35 percent, CFOs normally have an incentive not to repatriate cash; if they certify that they do not intend to dividend the retained earnings, they are not subject to incremental U.S. tax.</p>
<p class="para">This tax constraint can cause cash to be “trapped” overseas, perhaps making it difficult for CFOs to fund the parent company's interest and dividend payments. Thus, CFOs should maintain a good understanding of their foreign tax credit position and know how much cash could be repatriated to the United States with little or no tax cost. In addition, they should have a rough idea of the maximum amount of cash that could be repatriated quickly, if necessary, and a ballpark estimate of the incremental tax cost that would be incurred.</p>
