<p class="paraaftertitle">Without question, the CFO position has expanded dramatically in its breadth, complexity, and criticality. In a word, CFOs have indeed become more <span class="italic">strategic,</span> reflecting enhanced opportunities to impact a company's program for delivering shareholder value.</p>
<p class="para">In 2005, CFO Research Services prepared a report in collaboration with Booz Allen Hamilton entitled “The Activist CFO—Alignment with Strategy, Not Just with the Business.” In a prescient conclusion, the report noted the following:</p>
<p class="quote">And as CEOs are challenged by the external market and their boards of directors, they increasingly need a trusted adviser to help develop and execute corporate strategy. Thus CFOs are poised to take on an expanded and increasingly activist role within their companies. As part of this activist role, CFOs are increasingly aligning their function not just with the business but with the company's overall strategy. And by doing so, they are not just supporting the business with information and analyses, but also ensuring that the entire enterprise delivers on its commitments.<a id="int-not-0002-1" href="int-5.htm#int-not-0002"><span class="superscript">2</span></a></p>
<p class="para">This report also classified activist CFOs within four groups:</p><div class="list"><div class="item1">1. <span class="bold">“Growth navigators:</span> CFOs who work closely with CEOs to map out an aggressive course to profitable growth through acquisition or organic channels.”
</div>
<div class="item1">2. <span class="bold">“Execution maestros:</span> CFOs who focus on operational excellence and instill in their companies a value discipline that enables them to do more with less.”
</div>
<div class="item1">3. <span class="bold">“Turnaround surgeons:</span> CFOs who step in under close scrutiny to make difficult decisions that others often will not make—with the goal of restoring ailing companies to financial health.”
</div>
<div class="item1">4. <span class="bold">“Business model transformers:</span> CFOs who identify opportunities for strategic innovation and take advantage of them by recasting their companies' business models and organizations.”<a id="int-not-0003-1" href="int-5.htm#int-not-0003"><span class="superscript">3</span></a>
</div>

<p class="para">More recently, CFO Research Services published another report in collaboration with KPMG entitled “A New Role for New Times” that largely reaffirmed the trends that it outlined in its earlier study. The 2011 report concluded that “The finance function has come to contribute more substantively to developing and executing business strategy at a great many companies in recent years.”<a id="int-not-0004-1" href="int-5.htm#int-not-0004"><span class="superscript">4</span></a></p>
<p class="para">And the focus on strategy was further highlighted in 2011 when <span class="italic">The Wall Street Journal</span> convened the inaugural annual meeting of its “CFO Network.” The large company CFOs who attended this conference ranked <span class="italic">“Become a Strategic CFO”</span> as their top priority.<a id="int-not-0005-1" href="int-5.htm#int-not-0005"><span class="superscript">5</span></a></p>
<p class="para">Undoubtedly, these shorthand descriptions of the CFO position can be misleading in their overemphasis of certain aspects of the job. However, they do highlight the seemingly inexorable trend toward a CFO who is more integral to shaping and executing a company's strategic and business priorities.</p>
