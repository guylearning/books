<p class="chaptertitle">Prioritizing Capital Investments</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">THE CFO TYPICALLY MANAGES a company's process for determining  how much funding should be allocated to capital expenditures over a planning period and then prioritizing the potential investments within the company's funding constraints. It is a rare company, indeed, that does not have more proposals than can be funded.</p>
<p class="para">This is another example where the real world deviates from theory. In theory, a company should invest in all the projects whose returns exceed its risk-adjusted cost of capital. However, capital budgeting is usually subject to practical constraints that limit how much can and should be reinvested in the business.</p>
<p class="para">Prioritizing capital investments is one of the most challenging missions in the CFO's playbook, but also one of the best opportunities to preserve and grow shareholder value.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c05-1">CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The process for allocating capital begins with the cash flow projections. Using the company's long-term financial model, the CFO estimates the <span class="italic">cash flow from operations</span> over the planning period, with a particular focus on the budget year. Cash flow from operations consists of net income, plus non-cash expenses—such as depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangibles, and deferral of taxes—less net working capital requirements for inventories, receivables, prepaid expenses, and payables.</p>
<p class="para">The next step is to measure <span class="italic">free cash flow,</span> which is equal to cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures. The CFO will calculate the amount of capital expenditures that already have been approved—spending that is carried over from prior years—and show the preliminary estimate of the free cash flow that remains to be allocated. For example, the preliminary projections might look something like the following:</p>
<p><img src="../OEBPS/images/c05tab1.jpg" alt="nc02f001.eps" width="512" height="118"/></p>
<p class="para">The “available free cash flow” indicates the amount of cash that is available for discretionary uses, which, in addition to capital expenditures, can include dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c05-2">INVESTMENT BUDGET</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Using the preliminary free cash flow projections as a starting point, the CFO then will develop a tentative investment budget for the current year and the rest of the planning horizon.</p>
<p class="para">The tentative investment budget will reflect an estimate of the total cash funding for discretionary projects. In most cases, the projected spending will be shown as increases in capital expenditures. However, to the extent that the spending is expensed (such as research and development or marketing and advertising investments) the after-tax amount will be shown as a reduction in cash flow from operations. In either case, the net effect is to reduce the amount of free cash flow—thus decreasing the funds available for dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions.</p>
<p class="h2">Tentative Projections</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">After determining the tentative investment budget, the CFO updates the projections to show the new calculations of free cash flow. As a simplified illustration, the projections might show the following:</p>
<p><img src="../OEBPS/images/c05tab2.jpg" alt="nc02f001.eps" width="490" height="123"/></p>
<p class="para">The CFO then can analyze the availability of free cash flow in relationship to the company's projected uses of cash for dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions, as well as the company's availability of surplus cash or unused debt capacity.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs also should be mindful of investor expectations for the absolute levels and growth rates in free cash flow. Investors often base their valuations of a stock at least partially, if not largely, on this measure; it provides the input for their discounted cash flow analyses and they often relate the free cash flow per share to the company's stock price.</p>
<p class="para">For example, if the company's free cash flow per share is $1.00 and its stock price is $10.00, the stock is <span class="italic">yielding</span> 10 percent in cash that theoretically could be paid to shareholders.</p>
<p class="h2">Iteration of Alternatives</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Determining the actual investment budget almost invariably becomes an iterative process—starting with the tentative investment budget, but then considering alternative levels of investment spending. By arraying the numbers in a scorecard that is easily reviewed and updated, the CFO can facilitate a dialogue about the tradeoffs among alternative budget assumptions and provide a context for reviewing the investment projects.</p>
<p class="para">In parallel with this dialogue on the investment budget, the CEO and the management team will be reviewing the proposed projects—considering such factors as their criticality to the company's strategic objectives, their expected returns on investment, and their impact on the company's near-term and long-term financial performance. The CFO normally facilitates this review and provides analytical materials.</p>
<p class="para">As they review the projects, the CEO and management team may decide that because the company has so many essential and attractive projects, they should seek to expand the investment budget—asking the CFO to increase the size of the pie to be allocated.</p>
<p class="h2">Increasing the Investment Budget</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs have several potential levers for increasing the amount of capital that can be allocated to discretionary investments in the business. These levers generally fall into four categories:</p><div class="list"><div class="item1">1. Increase cash flow from operations: The company can accelerate revenue growth (e.g., by bringing a product to market more quickly), implement cost reduction measures (e.g., by deferring some discretionary programs), or reduce working capital requirements (e.g., by focusing on accounts receivable collections).
</div>
<div class="item1">2. Reduce other capital allocations: The company can choose to reduce the capital that it intends to allocate to dividend increases, share repurchases, or acquisitions—although the allocations should remain consistent with the framework for capital deployments that have been communicated to investors.
</div>
<div class="item1">3. Use surplus cash: If the company has a balance of excess cash, it may be more inclined to make discretionary investments due to their relatively low opportunity cost. However, any projects should still be subject to the constraint that they achieve the company's cost of capital.
</div>
<div class="item1">4. Obtain incremental financing: The company may be able to take advantage of attractive financing markets, giving it more short-term flexibility to expand its investment program—but careful not to deviate too much or for too long from its capital structure objectives.
</div>

</div>

<p class="h2">Driving the Process</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Managing the iterative process for determining the investment budget clearly is more art than science, with a goal of striking the right balance between near-term and long-term priorities. The CFO should drive this process; if not closely managed, it can turn into an infinite loop, making it impossible to implement the detailed investment programs on a timely basis. It is important to establish deadlines, force decisions, and not become buried in minutiae.</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>
</div>

<p class="featuretitle">Reinvestment Rates</p>
<p class="featurepara">As another tool in evaluating the size of their investment budget, CFOs may find it useful to calculate their company's historical and projected “reinvestment rate,” which is defined to be the total of capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development, and other investments as a percentage of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) plus research and development and other investments, less taxes. They then can compare trends in their reinvestment rate from year to year and perhaps benchmark this ratio against peer group companies.</p>
<p class="featurepara">According to a study performed by the consulting firm Fortuna Advisors, the reinvestment rate has been positively correlated with total shareholder return. Fortuna reached this conclusion from an analysis of 748 non-financial U.S. companies over the 2000 to 2009 time period, finding the correlations shown in <a id="c05-f-1-1" href="#c05-f-1">Figure A</a>.</p><div class="figure">

<p class="h1" id="c05-3">EVALUATING PROJECTS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In parallel with the review of the investment budget, the CFO will organize a process for allocating this budget among the proposed projects. The CFO typically accumulates summary information for each of the various proposals, including the amount of investment, the time frame, the non-financial resources required, and the projected financial impact. The CEO and management team then can objectively assess and prioritize the projects, keeping in mind the tentative investment budget and the alternative uses for this cash, including acquisitions.</p>
<p class="para">This review process provides the opportunity to sharpen the company's business strategies—deciding what concrete action plans will be pursued versus those that will be modified or deferred. Thus, the CFO should view potential projects through the lens of the company's strategic plan and ensure that the project evaluations focus on strategic as well as financial considerations.</p>
<p class="h2">Return on Investment Criteria</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Of course, return on investment measures will usually constitute the most important criteria in the evaluation of investment proposals. In most cases, it makes sense to show the return from the perspective of three core methodologies: net present value, internal rate of return, and payback. Each of these methodologies has complementary strengths and weaknesses, making their collective use much more informative than relying on any one of them alone.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Net present value (NPV)</span> is arguably the most valuable of the three methodologies: It is the purest measure of the amount of shareholder value that is being created. It is also easy to compare among projects, and it can flexibly incorporate decision tree inputs, including “real options,” as well as sensitivity analyses for each of the key variables.</p>
<p class="para">However, NPV has limitations when used in the context of a limited investment budget. A project may produce a large NPV, but use up most of the budget; this may result in a suboptimal allocation of capital and, more important, may cause other strategic priorities to be neglected or deferred.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, net present value calculations are highly dependent upon their terminal value. While a project may produce an attractive net present value, it may take a long time to show positive net income and cash flow benefits.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Internal rate of return (IRR</span>) can be a good complement to net present value by showing the magnitude of the expected return and can help optimize the returns on a limited investment budget. Moreover, IRR is not driven by a discount rate, which can facilitate a comparison of projects with differing risk characteristics. For example, if one project has a 20 percent return and another a 15 percent return, the decision maker can assess whether a 5 percentage point difference is worth the incremental risk.</p>
<p class="para">However, IRR has its shortcomings as well. In particular, a high return project may be too small to have much impact on the company's results, but require as much management focus as a lower return, but much larger, project. Also, similar to the NPV methodology, it may favor a project that has negative net income and cash flow for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Payback</span> shows the amount of time (expressed in years) it takes to get the company's cash investment back. This allows more focus on the near-term consequences of an investment. It is an especially instructive methodology for cost reduction projects, which normally should be expected to produce a relatively quick return. Many CFOs impose a minimum payback period for cost reduction projects (say, two or three years) as a means of prioritizing investment spending and ensuring that the company focuses on growth.</p>
<p class="para">The major disadvantages of payback are that it does not consider the results after the payback threshold has been achieved and it does not account for the time value of money. The latter disadvantage can be addressed by a <span class="italic">discounted payback,</span> which computes the breakeven point where a project has earned an economic return on the cash investment.</p>
<p class="h2">Other Financial Criteria</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In evaluating their investment priorities, companies may be more constrained by the forecasted impact on their net income than by the availability of cash or financing. For example, while investments in marketing and advertising or research and development can be expected to generate future revenue and profit, their accounting treatment as a current expense can make them problematic in meeting earnings expectations.</p>
<p class="para">Therefore, the CFO's evaluations should address not only the economic desirability of a potential investment (does it exceed the company's cost of capital?)  but also the impact on the company's <span class="italic">reported accounting results,</span> answering questions such as: What is the pro forma impact on operating margins, return on book capital, and earnings per share? Will this cause the company to compare unfavorably against analyst expectations or versus its competitors?</p>
<p class="para">The CFO should also consider the likely impact of the investment program on the company's <span class="italic">market valuation.</span> Are the investment projects consistent with the strategic objectives that have been articulated to investors? Will investors have confidence in the company's ability to execute the program? Will the projected investment returns seem credible?</p>
<p class="h2">Non-Financial Criteria</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">While CFOs apply standardized financial criteria as the cornerstones of their reviews, they also recognize that non-financial criteria—such as the availability of <span class="italic">human or technology</span> <span class="italic">resources</span>—should supplement or, in some cases, even supersede the financial criteria. This acknowledges that while additional resources can be added over the long term, they usually represent a practical constraint over a shorter time horizon.</p>
<p class="para">Moreover, a proposed investment may have a low or unquantifiable rate of return, but produce significant benefits to the company's <span class="italic">competitive positioning</span> or its <span class="italic">risk exposure.</span> For example, investments in technologies to safeguard customers' personal information can result in enormous benefits if, in fact, they prevent a compromising breach of the company's data network. However, it is usually difficult to forecast high returns for this kind of preventative investment because of the relatively low probability of an occurrence. Its IRR may be low, but its criticality may be irrefutable.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, CFOs should consider the <span class="italic">interdependencies</span> among projects—whether an investment will increase the probability of success in other projects; or conversely, whether the deferral of an investment will be beneficial due to the greater focus and concentration of resources on higher priority projects.</p>
<p class="h2">Information Technology Projects</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">It is especially important for CFOs to take a holistic, long-term approach to the evaluation of information technology projects. If IT projects are evaluated as discrete investments, the company may end up with a series of disjointed investment decisions that may make sense on a stand-alone basis, but that can result in a suboptimal—or even dysfunctional—IT configuration over the long run.</p>
<p class="para">Instead, the better approach is to develop a long-term IT strategy that encompasses a series of investments over time—accommodating future as well as current requirements. This IT strategic plan should include a long-range capital budget, as well as a staffing road map, including a breakdown between employees and contracted or outsourced resources. Specific projects should still be evaluated—to ensure that they make economic sense—but within the context of an overarching IT vision.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c05-4">CATEGORIZING PROJECTS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">After accumulating and summarizing the various investment proposals, CFOs usually will group the projects into various categories. For example, they may categorize the potential projects among those that are mandatory in response to regulatory requirements, those that are considered essential to achieving the company's strategic objectives, and those that are considered attractive, but truly discretionary, investments.</p>
<p class="para">They also will categorize the projects by business segments, business units, geographies, and product lines. These categories can help CFOs identify where resources are being directed and what areas are being deemphasized. This analysis can be especially instructive if the CFO also shows the free cash flow that is generated or used by each of the categories.</p>
<p class="para">Another popular approach is to categorize the projects by the purpose to be achieved. For example, the CFO may identify the amount of spending that is directed toward generating organic revenue growth, improving the infrastructure, and reducing the cost structure.</p>
<p class="para">These categorizations can help CFOs to clarify the tradeoffs and focus attention on the big picture implications of the company's investment  strategies—much in the manner that they would review a stock portfolio. In this way, they can analyze whether the composite picture represented by the allocations is consistent with the company's strategic plan as articulated to investors. This analysis also can reveal any excessive concentrations of risk and whether the projects, taken as a whole, strike the right balance between short-term and long-term priorities.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c05-5">MONITORING PROJECTS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should establish processes to monitor the implementation of the approved projects—especially whether they come in within budget and whether their anticipated benefits are in fact realized. The CFO usually distributes regular status reports on the projects to the CEO and management team, as well as summary reports that are provided periodically to the board of directors.</p>
<p class="para">These reports can provide advance warning concerning projects that may be getting off track, prompting remedial actions, or even abandonment. This can help avoid the propensity of struggling projects to become sink holes for continued funding.</p>
<p class="para">Also, business leaders may not apply the same rigor in managing capitalized expenses that they apply to expenses that have an immediate impact on their income statement. This can be especially true for spending on internally developed software, which is required by the accounting rules to be  capitalized—creating the risk of future write-offs.</p>
<p class="h2">Value of Real Options</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A tangible benefit from the monitoring of projects is that it can facilitate intensive scrutiny at critical decision junctures. This review at designated intervals is consistent with the concept of “real options,” and can result in significant financial benefits.</p>
<p class="para">Real options are based on the nodes in a decision tree that provide opportunities to analyze a project, deciding whether to continue the project as originally planned or whether it should be abandoned, modified, deferred, or expanded. This analysis considers the incremental cash flows from that point onward: Any spending that has been incurred to date represents “sunk costs” that are not relevant to the economic analysis going forward.</p>
<p class="para">The benefits from real options arise from the opportunity to take a different path along the decision tree than the original plan, resulting in increased discounted cash flow returns. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Abandonment:</span> Dispassionate project reviews can mitigate the all-too-human tendency to invest good money after bad. Although abandonment is not the preferred alternative—and certainly not what was expected when the project was initiated—it can preserve shareholder value if the incremental investments will not earn the cost of capital.</li><li><span class="bold">Modification:</span> A company may decide to continue a project, but to modify its original design. Because of the information gleaned since the project's inception—such as market or customer data—the project sponsor can make changes that enhance the incremental returns.</li><li><span class="bold">Deferral:</span> The project review may indicate that continued investments should be deferred until specified criteria are met. For example, the market for a new product may not be developing as quickly as anticipated. In this case, a deferral can create shareholder value due to the time value of money.</li><li><span class="bold">Expansion:</span> Real options can also indicate potential sources of value beyond the project in question. For example, a project may involve investments in a technology platform that is applicable to other products. In this case, the sunk costs from the initial project may allow these additional projects to become viable—because their incremental benefits now exceed their incremental costs.</li></ul>

<p class="para">CFOs should make sure that real options are analyzed with the same discipline as the initial decisions to proceed with the project. Furthermore, for major projects, they may want to incorporate the value of real options in their original calculations of net present values and internal rates of return, perhaps performing a full decision tree analysis.</p>
<p class="para">Although few CFOs explicitly calculate the value of real options in all of their discounted cash flow projections—especially for smaller projects—they should at least consider them subjectively in their rankings of potential investments. The fundamental point is that a project that has discrete decision points has more economic value than a project that requires all of its spending to occur without the opportunity to revisit its initial assumptions.</p>
<p class="h2">Value of Accumulated Information</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another advantage of regularly monitoring projects is that it captures valuable information that can inform evaluations of future investment proposals. For example, the data can indicate the project sponsor's credibility and project management skills. Furthermore, it can highlight the types of projects that are more likely to achieve their expected benefits. For example, a company may have much more predictable success from line extensions than from investments in new product categories.</p>
<p class="para">In other words, by establishing processes for monitoring the status and results of investment projects, CFOs can play a constructive role in orchestrating fact-based decision making—providing useful insights concerning the company's probability of success with respect to a given sponsor and type of project.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c05-6">PENSION FUND CONTRIBUTIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">When reviewing potential reinvestments in the business, CFOs should consider voluntary contributions to defined benefit plans as alternative uses of capital. First, the economic return on investment can be attractive. The company receives a tax deduction on the investment and the future earnings can compound tax free.</p>
<p class="para">Second, the investment can produce favorable accounting results, generally equal to the expected investment return that the company assumes for its pension fund accounting. For example, companies typically assume an investment return of about 8 percent, which implies an after-tax return of about 12 percent.</p>
<p class="para">Third, the company reduces an unfunded liability on its balance sheet, which the rating agencies generally will treat as a reduction in net debt. In addition, it gives the company more flexibility in its strategies for managing the pension fund, including shifting more of its assets to long-term fixed income securities. This can reduce the volatility in the company's pension fund expense and future funding requirements.</p>
<p class="para">However, voluntary contributions also have disadvantages. The investments generally cannot be withdrawn and the plan may become overfunded in the future. For example, the plan could become overfunded if interest rates rise appreciably from their current levels, causing a decrease in the plan's liabilities.</p>
