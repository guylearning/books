<p class="chaptertitle">Assessing Enterprise Risks</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">RISK MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN RECEIVING much more focus in recent years. Companies have been stepping up their risk procedures, the rating agencies are considering risk management in their credit evaluations, and boards of directors are devoting more of their agendas to risk oversight. Risk is now considered fundamental to a company's strategy; the best practice is to consider risk assessments as integral to strategic plan reviews.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c03-1">ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">This heightened focus on risk has been encapsulated in enterprise risk management (ERM) programs that take a systematic approach to identifying, monitoring, and mitigating risk exposures. Much of the impetus for ERM programs has come from regulatory pressures—notably from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the New York Stock Exchange's corporate governance rules—but undoubtedly they also have been motivated by recent events in the business, financial, and political environments—where so-called black swan events have challenged previously held beliefs concerning the predictability of the future. Furthermore, the financial crisis has caused considerable introspection concerning the degree to which incentive compensation may be causing behavior that is inimical to a company's long-term financial health—let alone to the overall economy.</p>
<p class="para">Against this backdrop, CFOs are plunging head first into risk—reviewing its implications for strategy and analyzing its potential to create both downside and upside to shareholder value. And they are becoming actively involved with ERM programs, which are now essential to the CFO's playbook.</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>
</div>

<p class="featuretitle">COSO Enterprise Risk Management-Integrated Framework</p>
<p class="featurepara">The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) published an ERM framework in 2004 that established eight components and four categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bolditalic">Components:</span> Internal Environment, Objective Setting, Event Identification, Risk Assessment, Risk Response, Control Activities, Information and Communication, Monitoring</li><li><span class="bolditalic">Categories:</span> Strategy, Operations, Financial Reporting, and Compliance</li></ul>

<p class="featurepara">In January 2011 COSO published a white paper entitled “Embracing Enterprise Risk Management” by Mark L. Frigo and Richard J. Anderson. This paper noted the following seven “underlying themes that have proved valuable in successful ERM initiatives”:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bolditalic">Themes:</span> Support from the Top is a Necessity, Build ERM Using Incremental Steps, Focus Initially on a Small Number of Top Risks, Build on Existing Risk Management Activities, Embed ERM into the Business Fabric of the Organization, and Provide Ongoing ERM Updates and Continuing Education for Directors and Senior Management</li></ul>
<div class="hr"><hr/>
</div>

</div>

<p class="h1" id="c03-2">IMPLEMENTATION OF ERM</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In implementing their ERM programs, companies generally proceed along the following path, although their actual processes can vary considerably by industry and by company.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Identify Risk Incidents.</span> Canvass people throughout the company to identify the major strategic, operational, financial, and compliance risks.</li><li><span class="bold">Quantify the Exposures.</span> Prioritize the greatest exposures by a combination of the probability of their occurrence and the likely impact if an incident occurs.</li><li><span class="bold">Assess the Current Status.</span> Determine to what extent action plans have been put in place to reduce the probability or the potential impact of an occurrence.</li><li><span class="bold">Assign Oversight Responsibilities.</span> Make someone accountable for assessing, monitoring, and developing action plans for each of the risks.</li><li><span class="bold">Establish a Governance Framework</span>. Institute a review process involving an overall ERM leader, an ERM steering committee, and oversight by the board of directors.</li><li><span class="bold">Prioritize Risk Exposures</span>. Focus the board's review on the risk exposures that represent the greatest threats to the company.</li><li><span class="bold">Analyze Mitigation Strategies</span>. Continuously consider potential action steps to mitigate existing or new risk exposures, including appropriate cost/benefit analyses.</li><li><span class="bold">Consider Potential Upsides</span>. Review ways that the company can use risk as a source of competitive advantage and financial rewards.</li></ul>

<p class="h1" id="c03-3">RISK IDENTIFICATION</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Typically, the identification of risk incidents begins with a large assortment of potential exposures, which then need to be reduced to a manageable number.</p>
<p class="para">For banks and financial services companies, the processes for identifying and managing risks have been well-established, with a predominant focus on asset portfolio risks and liquidity risks. For them, the establishment of an ERM program has meant a broadening of the risks that are managed and more formalization of the reporting arrangements, especially to the board of directors.</p>
<p class="para">For non-financial companies, internal audit reviews traditionally have covered such topics as disaster recovery, supply chain exposures, regulatory compliance, fraud, stewardship of assets, and availability of liquidity. For these companies, implementing ERM has meant not only a broadening of the risks being monitored, but also a shift in emphasis toward business risks that heretofore have not been a priority for internal audit reviews.</p>
<p class="para">As they identify risks, companies are challenged to focus on the new exposures that may arise in the future rather than on events that have occurred in the past. In other words, they need to look toward the horizon and not through the rear-view mirror.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c03-4">RISK QUANTIFICATION</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">After accumulating potential exposures, the next step is to categorize and quantify them. For example, many companies evaluate the risks through a heat map that ranks the risks according to a 1 to 5 scale on two dimensions: the probability of an occurrence and the magnitude of the potential impact. See <a id="c03-fig-0001-1" href="#c03-fig-0001">Figure 3.1</a> for an example.</p><div class="figure">
<p class="figurecaption"><span class="bold"><a id="c03-fig-0001" href="#c03-fig-0001-1">Figure 3.1</a></span> Quantifying Enterprise Risks</p><img src="../OEBPS/images/c03f001_fmt.jpg" alt="c03f001.eps" width="441" height="305"/>
</div>

<p class="para">In quantifying the <span class="italic">probability of an occurrence,</span> it is usually helpful to establish a time frame for when the event could occur—such as within the next five or 10 years. Otherwise, if the time frame is indefinite or infinite, the probability of a precipitating event (such as an earthquake or an economic meltdown) can reach close to 100 percent, which makes it a meaningless exercise.</p>
<p class="para">In quantifying the <span class="italic">magnitude of the impact,</span> some risks can be estimated in terms of lost revenue or incremental costs. For these risks, their potential impact can be analyzed as a percentage of the company's overall revenue or profit and the risk numbers can be assigned according to the relative dollar amounts of the exposure.</p>
<p class="para">However, in the case of other risks (such as a cyber attack), it may be very difficult to make credible financial estimates, and there could be a wide discrepancy between their immediate impact and their long-term implications. Therefore, an alternative way to quantify the risks is to assign a numerical ranking based on the <span class="italic">amount of disclosure</span> that would be required in the event of an occurrence.</p>
<p class="para">For example, an impact might be rated a “1” if it needs to be reported to the ERM steering committee; a “2” if it is reported to the CEO; a “3” if it is reported to the board of directors; a “4” if it should be included in the company's next 10-Q or 10-K filing; and a “5” if it requires an immediate press release and 8-K filing.</p>
<p class="para">ERM programs are generally evolving toward more subjectivity in their risk assessments, including risks that have a seemingly remote probability of occurring or that are difficult to quantify.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c03-5">MAJOR EXPOSURES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">When ERM was first introduced within a broad group of companies, much of their focus was on traditional balance sheet and financial risk exposures. However, after implementing ERM, they have gained more appreciation for the truly material threats to their well-being. As a result, managements and boards have escalated their focus on big picture risks, such as disruptive technologies, data security, reputation and brand image, government regulations, natural disasters, and long tail events.</p>
<p class="h2">Disruptive Technologies</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Companies have become more conscious of their exposures to potential technology breakthroughs that could seriously threaten the viability of their business models. It has become increasingly clear that the best way to reduce risk is to innovate continuously and perhaps to lead the cannibalization of their existing ways of doing business.</p>
<p class="para">ERM can help companies to overcome their natural reluctance to take a short-term hit to profitability for a long-term gain in their competitive positioning.</p>
<p class="h2">Data Security</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Companies have also become more sensitized to the potential threats to their data networks due to deliberate or accidental actions, especially when they can compromise personally identifiable information. The deliberately destructive hacking of company data systems by organized groups has been especially disconcerting to information technology experts, whose apprehension has been exacerbated by the proliferation of cloud computing and other external applications.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, their concern over cyber security has been reinforced by SEC guidelines published in October 2011 that require disclosures of actual cyber incidents (including their costs), potential cyber risks (including those related to outsourcing), and their degree of insurance coverage for cyber risks.</p>
<p class="para">In addition to the specific risks related to cyber security, companies are also generally concerned about inadvertent misuses of customer or employee data. This has led to more focus on passwords and other security protections and greater requirements for encrypted data in laptops and other portable devices.</p>
<p class="h2">Reputation and Brand Image</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Companies have become keenly aware that a business setback (such as a product recall) can cost much more than the direct costs if it damages the company's reputation and brand image. Furthermore, it's not only actual, but also rumored events that can jeopardize a company's reputation in the marketplace. The rapid dissemination of information through electronic media makes this threat all the more real and alarming.</p>
<p class="para">Given the high-profile issues that have arisen for some of the world's largest and most prestigious corporations, boards of directors and management teams have recognized that risk issues have the potential for creating much greater damage than their immediate financial impact. Indeed, fortifying their reputation and brand image can be considered the umbrella objective that drives their risk management programs.</p>
<p class="para">In addition, companies are paying closer attention to sustainability and other measures of their corporate social responsibility. In many cases, CFOs are taking the lead in developing metrics and targets for their company's efforts in areas of social concern.</p>
<p class="h2">Government Regulations</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">With the recent proliferation of burdensome legislation and regulations, companies have concluded that some of their greatest risks can emanate from governments and their agencies. This is crystal clear in the financial services industry—with the impending Dodd-Frank rules and the additional capital requirements being imposed on their activities by various regulatory authorities—but the threat of constraining and costly regulations is a common theme throughout all industries and all countries.</p>
<p class="para">Not coincidentally, companies are stepping up their government relations activities and adding board members with political and regulatory experience. This can alleviate exposures to their bottom lines and help to ensure that their strategic and business objectives will not be thwarted by external constraints.</p>
<p class="h2">Natural Disasters</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As evidenced by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami—as well as the floods in the United States and Thailand—the world seems to be going through a phase where natural disasters are increasing in their frequency and severity. Climate change has raised the stakes, creating much more uncertainty concerning risk exposures that can devastate a company's future prospects.</p>
<p class="para">Natural disasters are definitely risks that companies need to understand fully, including their potential exposures to supply chain and other operational risks, and they need to take proactive steps to reduce the potential magnitudes of loss.</p>
<p class="h2">Long Tail Events</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As evidenced by the financial crisis and recent natural disasters, the quantification of risks needs to account for the “long tail” possibilities—risks that have a remote probability based on normal standard deviations, but that can have catastrophic effects. Consequently, companies are focusing more attention on these potential calamities (which are also called “black swan” or “fat tail” events) and that heretofore have not been captured adequately by value at risk or other quantitative models.</p>
<p class="para">Companies are also examining the interdependencies of their risks across the globe. While a specific risk occurrence may not be material to a single location, it may cross the materiality threshold if it occurs simultaneously in several locations or if it is combined with other risk occurrences that arise from the same event.</p>
<p class="para">Although investors generally can diversify their exposures to economic and market conditions through the composition of their portfolios, they cannot protect themselves from the dislocations and incremental costs resulting from a company's financial duress or potential bankruptcy. Consequently, CFOs should be especially focused on the interdependencies of exogenous  events—such as the potential contagion resulting from sovereign debt defaults or the possibility of a worldwide recession—that could compromise the company's viability as a going concern.</p><div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr/>

<p class="h1" id="c03-6">MITIGATION STRATEGIES</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">After identifying their risk exposures, companies then determine which risks should be retained and which should be mitigated either through purchasing third-party insurance or by taking action steps to prevent an occurrence or to reduce the potential magnitude of loss.</p>
<p class="h2">Preventing an Occurrence</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The first priority in mitigating enterprise risks is to prevent an occurrence in the first place. CFOs should encourage action steps such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Business Decisions.</span> For example, not locating a nuclear plant in an earthquake-prone location.</li><li><span class="bold">Technology Investments.</span> For example, purchasing software that detects and prevents cyber attacks.</li><li><span class="bold">Management Practices.</span> For example, implementing procedures to enhance the quality of products or services.</li><li><span class="bold">Training and Education.</span> For example, sponsoring training programs in safety and preventative maintenance.</li><li><span class="bold">Management Oversight.</span> For example, establishing credit committees to monitor investment policies.</li></ul>

<p class="h2">Mitigating an Occurrence</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The second priority is to mitigate the potential impact in the event of an occurrence. CFOs should consider action steps such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Insurance Policies:</span> For example, purchasing property and casualty policies that include business interruption.</li><li><span class="bold">Disaster Recovery Plans:</span> For example, reviewing the status of disaster recovery plans as part of internal audit reviews.</li><li><span class="bold">Contractual Limitations:</span> For example, establishing limits in liability exposures for outsourcing or consulting services.</li><li><span class="bold">Backup Arrangements:</span> For example, identifying an alternative supplier in the event of a supply chain interruption.</li><li><span class="bold">Rapid Responses:</span> For example, developing contingency plans to respond quickly to potential threats to the company's reputation.</li></ul>

<p class="h1" id="c03-7">REWARDED VERSUS UNREWARDED RISKS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The purpose of ERM can be misconstrued as intending to eliminate all material risks, whatever the costs. Instead, the primary purposes of ERM are to understand a company's risk exposures and to adopt risk strategies that reflect the company's considered judgments concerning the appropriate risk and reward tradeoffs—often embracing the retention of risk as an appropriate business strategy.</p>
<p class="para">Within the risk management community, this distinction is often described as “rewarded” versus “unrewarded” risks. Unrewarded risks do not provide any upside to the company and typically should be managed to minimize their potential impact. In contrast, rewarded risks can be managed to realize their potential upside. It is akin to the distinction between “good” and “bad” cholesterol.</p>
<p class="para">For example, pursuing a new technology may cannibalize a company's existing products, but give it greater long-term potential (such as Netflix's introduction of direct streaming of videos); expanding aggressively in a cyclical downturn can pay off handsomely if the market recovers (such as ExxonMobil's investments in natural gas); or assuming contractual liabilities may allow a company to expand its market share (such as offering product warranties for medical devices or providing performance guarantees in an outsourcing contract).</p>
<p class="para">The basic point is that it may be difficult to earn superior returns without incurring some incremental risks. The question is not so much whether a strategy involves risk, but whether this risk is likely to be rewarded through greater growth or higher returns.</p>
<p class="h2">Diversifiable Risks</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In analyzing the potential for retaining rewarded risks, CFOs should make a distinction between risks that shareholders can mitigate through diversification versus those risks that investors would expect to be protected against.</p>
<p class="para">For example, investors who invest in a utility may seek exposure to nuclear energy, even though they know that it involves inherent financial and operational risks. Within the context of their diversified portfolio, the tradeoff makes sense. However, investors do not want risk exposures from locating a plant in a dangerous place or from implementing inadequate maintenance procedures.</p>
<p class="para">In other words, investors can accept strategic decisions that are carefully analyzed and fully communicated, but they will be unforgiving where management has failed to take reasonable precautions or has been negligent in execution.</p>
<p class="h2">Opportunity Costs</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs also should be mindful of potential opportunity costs from pursuing risk mitigation strategies. For example, a company that is concerned about cyber security may constrain the use of electronic equipment, such as forbidding employees from using mobile devices when traveling to certain countries. While this helps to mitigate the risk, it also makes it harder for employees to function, with possible consequences to revenue and profit.</p>
<p class="para">Mitigation strategies should be cost-effective and reasonable, with a balanced consideration of the pros and cons. The goal is not to minimize or eliminate risks, but to manage them intelligently.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c03-8">GOVERNANCE OF ERM</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Companies have adopted a variety of governance models for their ERM programs. The programs usually are led by a chief risk officer, the CFO, or by the head of compliance, and include a committee consisting of representatives from the business units as well as staff areas. The goal is to have a broad enough group to encompass the key risk areas, but to be small enough to require individual accountabilities.</p>
<p class="para">Recent surveys have indicated that more companies are identifying the chief risk officer as the person who assumes primary responsibility for their ERM programs. Risk professionals are especially likely to play a leadership role in regulated industries (e.g., financial services) or in companies where risk management is core to their business models (e.g., energy companies).</p>
<p class="h2">Board Oversight</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In overseeing the ERM program, boards of directors typically employ one of the following two primary alternatives:</p><div class="list"><div class="item1">1. Managing all of the risks by either a dedicated risk committee or the audit committee.
</div>
<div class="item1">2. Assigning oversight of the program to the audit committee, but delegating management of the various risks to either the entire board or to one of the board committees.
</div>

</div>

<p class="para">Involving the full board and all its committees has a number of advantages. First, it frees up time for the audit committee, which has seen its scope of responsibilities expand considerably in recent years. Second, some of the risks are better placed in alternative committees, such as financial risks in the finance committee and reputational risks in the corporate responsibility committee. Third, it avoids the need to establish a risk committee in a non-financial company. And fourth, given the importance of risk management as a strategic imperative, it makes sense that the whole board should be accountable.</p>
<p class="h2">Strategic Plan Coordination</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As a best practice, the board should explicitly address risk implications when conducting strategy reviews with management. Also, the compensation committee should assess whether the incentive compensation programs are appropriately balanced from a risk perspective. Especially for financial services companies, it is critically important that the compensation programs avoid asymmetric incentives that encourage excessive risk-taking through their upside rewards without commensurate exposures in downside scenarios.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, a relatively new SEC rule mandates that public companies analyze and disclose compensation practices that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c03-9">CFO'S ROLE IN ERM</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Irrespective of the management reporting structure, CFOs should play a leadership role in ERM, bringing their unique abilities to influence the program's success.</p>
<p class="h2">Linkage to Strategy</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Probably the most compelling reason is the linkage to strategy. Given their role in articulating the strategic plan, it makes sense for CFOs to play an active role in assessing the risk implications.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs should determine whether the strategies will exacerbate any enterprise risks and, if so, whether and how the company should mitigate these exposures. In addition, they should evaluate potential upsides from assuming greater risks in implementing the strategies. For example, the company could assume greater risks by accelerating the launch dates for new products. The question is whether the expected upsides to shareholder value outweigh the increased exposures to risk.</p>
<p class="h2">Financial Organization</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The financial organization usually is aware of potential issues throughout the company and has formal communication channels through Sarbanes-Oxley, including a disclosure committee that meets at least quarterly. CFOs can tap into this financial network and encourage the free flow of relevant information through both formal and informal communication channels—serving as an early warning system concerning potential risk exposures.</p>
<p class="h2">External Contacts</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In identifying risks, ERM strives to identify not only existing risks, but also those that may be emerging. Because of their external contacts, CFOs have a good vantage point for identifying potential threats and opportunities.</p>
<p class="para">For example, CFOs can obtain valuable intelligence from both equity and fixed income analysts, who often have a window into emerging technologies, possible competitor actions, or impending regulatory changes. It's a good bet that if an issue is surfaced by a buy side analyst, it is probably something that's worth investigating.</p>
<p class="para">Likewise, the CFO's relationships with investment bankers, regulators, rating agencies, and other CFOs can be fertile sources concerning issues that may be coming down the pike.</p>
<p class="h2">Market Intelligence</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In a similar manner, financial markets may be indicating a heightened risk exposure. For example, a rumor may cause a material change in the company's stock price or options pricing. The CFO can follow up to determine whether there is any truth to the rumor and determine if it requires a response.</p>
<p class="para">As another example, the company's bond prices or its pricing in the credit default market may be indicating a credit issue that is arising from external actions, such as a competitor's introduction of a new technology or a significant merger in the industry.</p>
<p class="h2">Mitigation Expenses</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs have the tools and processes for analyzing potential mitigation strategies, including the purchase of insurance or investments in risk avoidance technologies. In particular, they can evaluate the potential investments against other priorities in the investment budget.</p>
<p class="para">This includes comparing projects that produce a fairly predictable rate of return with mitigation strategies that produce an extremely uncertain rate of return (such as investments that protect the company against catastrophic consequences from a highly improbable event).</p>
<p class="para">Another example is investing in government affairs and lobbying to protect against regulatory risks throughout the world. It's hard to quantify a rate of return, but this very well could be a good use of capital, especially for companies in regulated industries. CFOs can help to evaluate the potential investment from the shareholder's perspective.</p>
<p class="h2">Investor Interest</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Investors want to understand a company's risk management strategies. In virtually every one-on-one or small group meeting, they will ask management about the company's exposures to material risks, often couching the question as “What keeps you up at night”?</p>
<p class="para">By being actively involved in ERM, CFOs can provide a powerful response to this boiler-plate question by describing the robustness of their company's ERM program and their efforts to mitigate the most significant risks. This can be very reassuring to investors, reinforcing their decision to own the company's stock or debt.</p>
<p class="h2">Rating Agency Criteria</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The rating agencies have taken a keen interest in the status of companies' risk management processes and now are explicitly considering ERM as part of their ratings criteria. They view ERM as one of the hallmarks of superior management and emblematic of good governance practices. They also are specifically asking about the processes for defining the company's risk appetite.</p>
<p class="para">By including ERM as part of their regular presentations to the rating agencies, CFOs can engage in a rich discussion concerning risk strategies and perhaps gain insights concerning the best practices being implemented by other companies.</p>
