<p class="chaptertitle">Executing Divestitures and Spinoffs</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs SHOULD REGULARLY CONSIDER potential opportunities for selectively pruning a company's business portfolio. This can sharpen the company's strategic focus and generate capital to be redeployed in the business or else returned to shareholders.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c10-1">DIVESTITURE EVALUATIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs should recognize that periodically reviewing the company's portfolio is a healthy exercise that can generate significant shareholder value. Some of the reasons for divesting a business can include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Strategic Fit:</span> It no longer fits with the company's strategic objectives.</li><li><span class="bold">Return on Investment:</span> It is not expected to earn the company's cost of capital.</li><li><span class="bold">Value of Synergies:</span> It will have more value to an acquirer who can realize synergies.</li><li><span class="bold">Risk Implications:</span> It has risk exposures that the company does not want to retain.</li><li><span class="bold">Management Focus:</span> It will not receive sufficient focus from the company's management.</li></ul>

<p class="para">Simply put, a divestiture can make a great deal of strategic sense, especially if the business is likely to receive an attractive valuation in the market. After a divestiture candidate has been identified, CFOs then can perform a financial analysis to confirm that the divestiture makes economic sense—comparing the value to be obtained in the market versus the value to be realized from retaining the business.</p>
<p class="h2">Valuation Analysis</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In analyzing a divestiture, CFOs should use the same valuation methodologies that are applied to acquisitions. They then should consider the alternatives for accomplishing a divestiture, determine the likely value to be received, estimate the likely time frame for completing a transaction, and assume a tentative use of the proceeds. They also should analyze the pro forma impacts and judge whether the transaction is likely to be positively received by investors.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c10-2">HIRING INVESTMENT BANKERS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Unless the divestiture is too small or the transaction is likely to be very straightforward, it usually makes sense to hire an investment banker or other financial advisor to confirm that the transaction makes economic sense; to recommend a divestiture process; and, most important of all, to help execute the transaction, which can be quite labor intensive, especially if conducting a competitive auction.</p>
<p class="para">Investment bankers can be very helpful due to their merger and acquisition expertise, their contacts with potential acquirers, and their knowledge of market values. In a sell side assignment, they usually are well worth their admittedly high fees.</p>
<p class="para">They also can provide a “<span class="italic">fairness opinion,</span>” which may be desired by the board of directors or required by debt covenants. However, some investment banks are reluctant to provide these opinions, so it is good to clarify up front whether this service will be included in the engagement—which may influence the CFO's choice among potential advisors.</p>
<p class="para">The other alternative is to hire an additional firm to provide the fairness opinion, but not to assist with the transaction. This adds some cost, but helps to ensure an independent appraisal that is not influenced by the potential transaction fee.</p>
<p class="h2">Compensation Arrangements</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs also should consider the way that they want to compensate the investment bankers. They can pay a fixed amount, which lends certainty to the total, or they can pay a sliding scale (normally a percentage of the proceeds), thus creating incentives to perform. Another common alternative is to apply different percentages to varying levels of proceeds, which creates additional incentives to obtain a higher price.</p>
<p class="para">The main disadvantage with incentive arrangements is that they can result in a relatively high fee for the transaction, which may not be indicative of the investment banker's performance (e.g., it may have resulted from a low-ball estimate of the likely price to be received). Furthermore, incentive fees can make it more difficult to consider non-price criteria when comparing alternative bids (e.g., a higher bid may include more liability exposures, or may be contingent on obtaining financing or receiving anti-trust approval).</p>
<p class="para">Regardless of the way that the fee arrangements are structured, CFOs should request precedents of fees paid in similar transactions. In addition, they may want to obtain a market check from another investment bank or a law firm to confirm that the proposed fee is consistent with the going rate.</p>
<p class="para">CFOs also should closely scrutinize the way that the divestiture proceeds are calculated. For example, they should understand how cash or working capital will be treated, as well as the acquirer's assumptions of debt or other liabilities. Earnouts or other contingent payments can also create complications that should be clarified in advance.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, CFOs should be vigilant concerning ongoing entanglements. These continuing obligations can include a “tail” that commits the seller to pay the fee if a transaction occurs within a specified time period (usually one to two years) or an agreement to use the investment bank as an advisor on other transactions, such as financings or other merger and acquisition transactions. While it is reasonable to agree to “consider” the bank for future assignments, an iron-clad commitment should be avoided under most circumstances.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c10-3">AUCTION or NEGOTIATED</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The two basic approaches to a divestiture are to conduct an auction or to negotiate a one-off transaction, although there are several permutations between these two alternatives. For example, the seller can conduct a limited auction, with a handful of selected participants, or it can pursue simultaneous negotiations with a few potential acquirers.</p>
<p class="h2">Competitive Auctions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The primary advantage of an auction is that it can create competition among the potential acquirers, usually resulting in a higher price and better contractual terms. However, it is a disruptive process that can be very time consuming for the management of the business being divested, and it is hard to execute an auction quietly in the market. In particular, the business can deteriorate, which can be especially problematic in the event of a failed auction.</p>
<p class="para">If an auction is pursued, the steps usually include preparing an offering memorandum, inviting potential acquirers to participate, negotiating non-disclosure agreements, establishing a data room (often electronic rather than physical), holding information meetings, soliciting preliminary indications of interest, narrowing the bidders, distributing contracts to be marked up by the bidders, seeking final and best pricing, and negotiating a definitive sale agreement with one or two of the bidders.</p>
<p class="h2">Negotiated Transactions</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In contrast, a negotiated transaction is usually accomplished through more tailored exchanges of information with one or a few potential buyers. It can be a quieter and less disruptive process than an auction, although the seller should recognize that it's still hard to avoid leaks, especially in industries with active grapevines. Nevertheless, a negotiated deal represents less risk to the business.</p>
<p class="para">A negotiated transaction often includes a “letter of intent” that clarifies the key terms, although both parties recognize that it is a non-binding agreement and the terms are often changed due to information learned in due diligence or to reflect changes in the business or the financial markets.</p>
<p class="para">To preserve its negotiating leverage, the seller normally preserves its options to conduct an auction or to retain the business. CFOs should also insist on relatively short windows for “exclusive” negotiations. If the negotiations are going well, the time period can always be extended; but if not, the seller has more flexibility to pursue an alternative path.</p>
<p class="h2">Retention Agreements</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In either approach, the prospective transaction usually causes considerable anxiety among the divestiture's management team, whose future prospects may be highly uncertain, especially if the business is being sold to a strategic buyer. Therefore, it is usually helpful to establish retention agreements with the management team, including incentive bonuses through the estimated closing date for the transaction.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, because of the risk to the business, CFOs generally should not initiate a divestiture process unless there is a good probability that it will result in a completed transaction at a reasonable price. If a transaction is not consummated, it may be difficult to restore the business momentum due to a pall of uncertainty that can affect the management team and perhaps customers as well.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c10-4">STOCK OR ASSETS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs generally prefer to execute a divestiture through a stock transaction rather than an asset deal. A stock deal makes it much less likely that the seller will retain liability exposures, creating less residual risk subsequent to closing.</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, the seller may favor an asset deal if the tax treatment is better or if it is necessary to attract buyers at an attractive price. In this case, the seller will seek to negotiate contractual terms that limit its potential financial exposures to known liabilities, as well as to existing issues that are not known prior to closing.</p>
<p class="para">The acquirer is likely to seek compensation for existing liabilities through the seller's contractual representations and warranties. One of the advantages of divesting through an auction process is that the seller may have more leverage in negotiating the contract terms, including limitations on its exposures to representations and warranties.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c10-5">FINANCING CONDITIONS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">If the seller is conducting an auction where the potential buyers include private equity firms, the transaction may be offered with prepackaged bank financing attached. This “stapled” financing can expedite a transaction and make it more likely to be consummated. However, some shareholders of public companies have challenged this practice, claiming that it compromises the investment banker's objectivity due to the prospect of receiving lucrative financing fees.</p>
<p class="para">Otherwise, the bidders in auctions are expected to arrange their own financing and are asked to describe the financing arrangements in their proposal. In particular, they will state whether their offer is contingent on obtaining financing, which will be one of the criteria used to select the winning bidder. Generally, the best alternative will be a strategic buyer with cash on hand; the next best will be an acquirer with committed bank financing; the least best will be a “highly confident” letter that financing can be obtained.</p>
<p class="para">If the acquirer does not have financing arranged, then the CFO must assess the probability that it can be obtained and factor this contingency into the evaluation of the offer. This may cause the CFO to eliminate a bidder from an auction or to discontinue a negotiated transaction.</p>
<p class="h2">Seller Financing</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs are sometimes faced with a request to offer seller financing to expedite a divestiture to a third party with limited access to capital. This typically does not become an issue unless the divestiture is not attracting much interest and the possibility of seller financing is the only way that it can get done.</p>
<p class="para">In these instances, CFOs generally recognize that seller financing (typically in the form of subordinated debt or preferred stock) will be illiquid and will have a reasonable probability of not being repaid in full. Moreover, the interest rate may not reflect an arm's length valuation.</p>
<p class="para">Consequently, CFOs will recognize that the fair market value of seller financing may be substantially less than its face value. They usually will establish an appropriate reserve against loss—thus mitigating the company's exposure to a potential write-off in the future.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c10-6">MANAGEMENT PARTICIPATION</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another delicate issue concerns the possibility of the divestiture's management team becoming involved in a sale to a private equity buyer. On the one hand, the management team's participation in a transaction can give comfort to the private equity firm and result in a higher offer. On the other hand, their participation involves obvious conflicts of interest—especially if the potential buyers include both strategic and private equity acquirers.</p>
<p class="para">When confronted with this dilemma, CFOs should recognize that there are no foolproof ways to avoid the inherent conflicts, and to manage the issues in the best manner possible—leaning heavily on guidance from the general counsel and often external legal advisors as well. The best approach is to deal openly with the issues and to ensure that everyone is aware of the potential consequences.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c10-7">TAX-FREE SPINOFFS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In some situations, CFOs may recommend that a divestiture be accomplished through a spinoff rather than a sale transaction. First, a spinoff usually can be accomplished as a tax-free transaction for both the company and its shareholders; this is especially important if the market value of the business substantially exceeds its tax basis. Second, a spinoff preserves the upside for shareholders if the value of the business is currently depressed and is expected to increase in the future. Third, a spinoff typically has less execution risk than a sale transaction.</p>
<p class="para">The primary disadvantage with a spinoff is that it does not produce any cash for the seller. However, this disadvantage can be mitigated if the business raises debt prior to the spinoff and dividends the proceeds to the parent company. Furthermore, additional cash can be raised through a <span class="italic">sponsored spinoff</span> in which a private equity firm makes a minority equity investment in the company prior to the spinoff.</p>
<p class="para">Another disadvantage to a spinoff is that it does not capture the value of the synergies that can be realized through a sale to a strategic acquirer. In fact, the spinoff will require incremental expenses to operate as a standalone public company.</p>
<p class="para">However, provided that there is no pre-existing agreement, the value of synergies can be realized subsequent to the spinoff if a strategic acquirer makes an offer directly to the spinoff's shareholders. This will be a taxable event for the spinoff's shareholders, but if sufficient time has passed, it should not result in a tax liability to the parent company.</p>
<p class="para">A substantial portion of the parent company's shareholders may not be able to own the spinoff's shares, resulting in considerable churn in the spinoff's shareholder base. For example, index funds usually cannot retain the shares of a spinoff (it usually will not be part of the index) and institutional shareholders may be compelled by their investment policies to sell the shares. However, while this turnover can depress the share price at the outset, spinoffs generally have achieved superior stock market performance after this initial period of adjustment. This outperformance is usually attributed to enhanced management focus after separating from the parent company.</p>
<p class="h2">Morris Trust Spinoffs</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">CFOs formerly could use a Morris Trust structure to achieve favorable tax treatment through a spinoff transaction. This treatment emanated from a court case in 1966 that ruled that if a parent company was acquired immediately subsequent to a spinoff, no tax would be owed by either the parent company or the spinoff's shareholders.</p>
<p class="para">However, this tax treatment was changed by Congress in 1997. The legislation provided that if either the parent company or the spinoff is acquired, then the spinoff is a taxable event to the parent company unless it can be proven that there was no integrated plan and enough time has passed (generally at least six months to two years).</p>
<p class="para">Nevertheless, CFOs can still take advantage of an exception built into the legislation—a <span class="italic">reverse Morris Trust.</span> This exception applies if the spinoff merges with another company, provided that the spinoff's shareholders own a majority of the combined company's shares. In other words, it is still treated as a tax-free spinoff so long as it is the acquiring company.</p>
<p class="para">The reverse Morris Trust structure was used, for example, in Verizon's spinoff of a portion of its wireless operations into FairPoint Communications and Walt Disney's spinoff of its radio business into Citadel Broadcasting. Most recently Mead-Westvaco used this structure in a transaction with Acco Brands. Consequently, although a reverse Morris Trust requires specific facts and circumstances, it's a proven alternative that CFOs should include in their playbook of divestiture alternatives.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c10-8">SPLIT-UPS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In a split-up, a company divides itself into two or more publicly held companies. Although it is usually accomplished through a tax-free spinoff, it is more akin to a de-merger than a divestiture.</p>
<p class="para">Split-ups eliminate the conglomerate discount for disparate businesses. Furthermore, the separated businesses often perform better due to enhanced management and shareholder focus. As a result, the announcement of a split-up transaction usually results in at least a short-term increase in a company's stock price. Some recent examples include Fortune Brands, Marathon, ConocoPhillips, and Kraft.</p>
<p class="para">Activist investors may propose a split-up as a way to increase the value of their shareholdings. Therefore, CFOs may want to analyze this alternative in advance of receiving a proposal, gaining an understanding of the pros and cons of the potential transaction. And if makes sense, they may want to advocate a split-up as a way to create shareholder value.</p>
<p class="para">Furthermore, if a company decides to retain disparate businesses, the CFO should seek to maximize the advantages of them being part of the same company; in addition to overhead savings and greater economies of scale, these benefits can include tax savings, lower debt costs, cross-selling between businesses, and any halo effects in the marketplace due to the company's overall reputation and brand image. Furthermore, customers, suppliers, and employees may take comfort in the greater financial strength of the combined entity.</p>
<p class="h1" id="c10-9">EQUITY CARVE-OUTS</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Another alternative is to sell a minority stake in a subsidiary company via an “equity carve-out.” In this relatively rare form of transaction, the parent company typically sells up to 20 percent of the shares of a subsidiary, thereby continuing to file a consolidated tax return and preserving the flexibility to execute a tax-free spinoff in the future.</p>
<p class="para">Companies usually pursue equity carve-outs to call the market's attention to a valuable business whose shares will trade at a premium valuation to the parent company's and to offer stock incentives to the subsidiary's management team. For example, EMC sold 10 percent of the shares of its fast-growing VMware subsidiary in 2006—thus highlighting the significant increase in the value of the business since being acquired by EMC and its growing contribution to the parent company's market valuation.</p>
<p class="para">While equity carve-outs can highlight an undervalued business, they require arms-length arrangements with the parent company, which can create administrative complexities and potential conflicts of interest. Furthermore, issuing the shares may cause shareholders to propose a complete separation through a sale or spinoff.</p>
