    <p class="Chapter-Title" id="idParaDest-3">Introduction</p>

    <p class="IntroParagraph">Congratulations on your decision to learn HTML and CSS! These languages are used daily by billions of people on web pages and apps and in countless other forms. Whether you’re planning to build websites, wish to have an informed conversation with a developer, or just want to have a better understanding of the world around you, this book is a great start!</p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-4"><a id="idTextAnchor001"/>HTML and CSS Are Everywhere</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">It is nearly impossible to go about your day without encountering HTML and/or CSS. These languages lurk behind every web page, most application screens, television and video game console interfaces, and even the screen of your new smart fridge. You are continually consuming the results of this code but probably rarely stop to think about what’s under the hood. That’s about to change.</p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-5"><a id="idTextAnchor002"/>My Story</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">Hello! My name is David. I grew up in a small town outside of Rochester, New York. I spent countless hours of my childhood exploring the beautiful outdoors of upstate New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire via the plentiful hiking trails and campsites.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">I didn’t have a computer in my home, but that wasn’t unusual at the time. My interest in technology started early, and video games helped fuel this passion. Once I had access to a computer, I began to teach myself coding in a programming language called BASIC. In high school, I moved on to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">When I was deciding what path to take, I considered computer science, software engineering, and other tech-heavy options. I eventually decided to pursue a degree in information technology, which I saw as a bridge between the computer and the human side of tech. I attended the Rochester Institute of Technology and was able to learn from some fantastic professors, many of whom came from non-computer-related backgrounds. They became teachers when the skills they had learned developed into a new industry. These professors helped me to see that sharing skills I have learned can take many forms.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">In 2008, after moving to New York City and working in my field for several years, I was offered a position as an adjunct professor at the CUNY City College of Technology, where I rounded out the web design curriculum by introducing different web technologies I used in my everyday life on web development projects. Since then, I have moved on to other schools where I teach a wide variety of classes covering HTML and CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and WordPress. I enjoy the process of teaching, seeing new students’ confidence grow as they feel more comfortable with new ideas, and watching the “light bulb” blink on when they see how they can use their newfound knowledge. </p>

    <p class="H2_Body">Outside of teaching, I work for Adobe as a technical account manager supporting the Adobe Experience Cloud collection of products. I still do plenty of freelance web development projects, and when I’m not building things online, I disconnect through hiking or camping on our local trails or in the mountains of Vermont and New Hampshire. At home, I dabble in woodworking and beekeeping. My wife and I work with various animal rescue organizations and are restoring our 1897 Shingle Victorian house in the northwest corner of Connecticut (figure 1).</p>

        <img alt="" class="w-100" src="image/Figure1.jpg"/>

      </figure>

    </div>

    <p class="H2_Body">On-the-job learning has always been a part of my life. Though my education gave me a wide range of skills, the technology industry is continually changing. The number one skill I have developed is learning how to learn. I always find myself researching and learning new tools, techniques, and strategies for the work that I do. </p>

    <p class="H2_Body">In the spirit of continued learning in an ever-changing landscape, I wanted to write this book to create a quick but comprehensive guide to the tools I see as most valuable and most used in my experience as a web developer.</p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-6"><a id="idTextAnchor003"/>Why Learn HTML and CSS?</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">There are numerous reasons why you might have picked up this book. You may be interested in coding and someone suggested that you start with HTML and CSS. Your company may need to build or revamp a website. You may wish to start a web design firm. Or, like me, you might simply have an insatiable desire to learn.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">Regardless of your motivations, HTML and CSS are a great place to start learning how to code. The languages require only a text editor and a web browser—two things you already have on your computer. And HTML and CSS offer instant gratification. You can put a few lines of HTML into a text file, save it, then open the file in a browser and immediately see your results.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">The instant feedback of writing HTML can be appealing and satisfying to those who do not consider themselves computer experts. Results appear with a few straightforward instructions. Even a basic understanding of how to use these tools can give you a sense of moving from computer “user” to “superuser.” While it’s not technically programming, writing frontend markup in languages like HTML and CSS allows you to provide direction to the computer to display content in the precise way you desire.</p>

    <div class="standard-box">

      <figure class="horizontal-image-wrap" epub:type="z3998:figure">

        <img alt="" class="w-100" src="image/questionLogo.png"/>

      </figure>

      <p class="Question">Q: Is HTML a programming language? </p>

      <p class="H2_Body">Technically, HTML is not a programming language. HTML stands for “hypertext markup language.” A <span class="glossaryterm idGenCharOverride-1">markup language</span> “marks up” text with instructions for display—in this case, via a web browser. Programming languages, on the other hand, use logical control statements to direct the flow of the program’s execution. Programs take input and produce output, whereas HTML and related markup languages format existing content. Both are called coding, but there is a subtle difference. </p>

    </div>

    <p class="H3">WordPress</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">WordPress excels at blog and website creation but removes some of the control you have over HTML and CSS code. It’s simple to add a page or blog post, but customizing the overall look and feel of the website, or creating a new website theme, requires knowledge of HTML and CSS. Even if you use WordPress, knowing HTML and CSS will transform your WordPress data entry skills into those of a full-fledged WordPress web developer.</p>

    <p class="H3">Wix and Squarespace</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Wix, Squarespace, and other website-building tools are excellent platforms for building a website. Their easy-to-use interfaces allow you to create a simple site with no knowledge of HTML. Both Wix and Squarespace allow for customization, but some custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript isn’t possible inside their platforms. Moreover, the website you build cannot be downloaded and used on other web servers. You must continue to purchase their services to maintain your site.</p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-7"><a id="idTextAnchor004"/>Who Can Benefit from This Book?</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">Any professional who uses the internet and technology can benefit from knowing HTML and CSS. In the process of writing this book, one of our editors lamented that roadblocks he had encountered in a previous position could have been avoided had he been able to make changes to website code himself. The IT staff and programming team had to handle his requests, slowing down his workflow and creating a more significant burden on the IT department.</p>

    <p class="H3">Students of Web Development</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Are you learning to build websites? This book will give you the foundation you need to understand the two core components of modern web design.</p>

    <p class="H3">Educators</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Will you be teaching web development? This book will help you get ahead of the most common questions your students will ask. It provides step-by-step guidance that will help you bring your students through the learning process with ease.</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) initiatives are proliferating in elementary, middle, and high schools throughout the world. Many educators are pushing the boundaries of their knowledge to bring technology education to students at younger ages. This book works as a guide for students of all ages and can be used to assist teachers who are not highly experienced in the field of web development.</p>

    <p class="H3">Adjacent Professionals</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Perhaps your job doesn’t require you to code websites, but you work with a developer or team that does. Understanding the process will enable you to have informed conversations and be able to advocate for your needs. If you have to hire a web designer, you’ll have a leg up in the interview process, allowing you to make a better hiring decision.</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Marketers and graphic artists frequently interact with web designers. Knowing HTML and CSS will benefit your project(s) and enable you to provide more value to your organization.</p>

    <p class="H3">Professionals Looking for a Quick Reference/Primer</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">With easy-to-follow examples and plain-speak guidance, this book is excellent as a quick reference or refresher for a tool you don’t use often or for someone getting back into the game.</p>

    <p class="H3">Web Hobbyists</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Many people build websites for their own enjoyment, as a passion project or hobby. This guide will provide a footing to begin building your sites from the ground up. </p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-8"><a id="idTextAnchor005"/>Employment Roles that Benefit from HTML/CSS Knowledge</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">If your overall goal is to become a programmer or developer, HTML/CSS is an excellent place to start.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">There is a definite benefit in learning HTML and CSS, even if becoming a developer is <span class="italic idGenCharOverride-2">not</span> your ultimate goal. Since many of our daily activities involve a computer of some sort, it makes sense that more employees are expected to have a basic understanding of how computers display data. Even office managers and assistants are sometimes responsible for modifying web pages, so knowing how to do this gives you a clear advantage over other applicants. </p>

    <p class="H2_Body">Let’s take a closer look at some of the workplace roles that utilize HTML/CSS:</p>

    <p class="H3">Artist / Graphic Designer</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Since HTML and CSS are essentially a method for displaying content, it makes sense that graphic designers would benefit from having a full understanding of these technologies to showcase their work. Knowledge of the HTML and CSS code necessary to display graphical content on the web gives the designer a tremendous advantage. </p>

    <p class="H3">Marketer</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Marketers often need to generate new materials for sales initiatives. Landing pages and email marketing messages are excellent ways to showcase your product and call customers to action, and these pages use HTML and CSS code. Basic HTML/CSS knowledge will enable you to respond quickly to marketing opportunities.</p>

    <p class="H3">Writer / Content Provider</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">In the (not-so-distant) past, reporters and journalists would type their articles then hand them off to others for print layout. Now, with the growth of the internet and blog-driven content, writers often are asked to format their work in a nearly internet-ready format. Even though many publications use content management systems like WordPress, it is often necessary to make edits to the HTML code to ensure proper display.</p>

    <p class="H3">Social Media Manager</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">While managing likes, shares, comments, and retweets may make up a large part of a social media manager’s schedule, sourcing and delivering engaging content is vitally important. Knowing how to use links and basic HTML and CSS code will enable the social media guru to better format posts and linked content, giving them a leg up on the competition.</p>

    <p class="H3">Entry-Level Quality Assurance Engineer</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Many quality assurance (QA) professionals are responsible for testing software and websites. Understanding the display code behind the user interface gives a quality assurance engineer an advantage when crafting tests and preparing reports.</p>

    <div class="standard-box">

      <figure class="horizontal-image-wrap" epub:type="z3998:figure">

        <img class="w-100" src="image/noteLogo.png"/>

      </figure>

      <p class="Note">Modern QA testing has evolved toward automatic testing procedures. Often, configuring these systems requires knowledge of HTML and CSS.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="H3">Nonprofit </p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Nonprofit organizations have many of the same needs as larger companies, with one significant difference: they typically lack the budget to hire full-time developers. If you are an employee at a nonprofit, you can strengthen your organization by learning HTML and CSS. With web design knowledge, you can build and maintain your organization’s website, design email marketing campaigns, and fully take advantage of social media.</p>

    <p class="H3">Entrepreneur / Small Business Owner</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">If you are starting your own business, you already know firsthand that everything costs money and technical skills and know-how are particularly expensive. Knowing how to build your website could save you a fortune!</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Even if you can’t design the entire site yourself, providing a mockup of your ideas will save your designer time. And knowing HTML and CSS will help you make better hiring decisions with your technical staff and contractors.</p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-9"><a id="idTextAnchor006"/>How the Book Is Structured and How You Will Learn</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">With each chapter, I’ll introduce new concepts via explanation, illustrations, and stand-alone examples. I’ll provide context for each topic, so you’ll know why it will be useful. Where relevant, I will add specifics from my own professional experience.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">To add to the learning experience, we’ll be providing you with an actual website that you’ll be working on intermittently throughout the book. The website will be presented to you in need of a whole lot of tender love and care. But by the time you finish this book and have completed all the exercises, you’ll be well on your way to delivering a high-quality, fully functional web product—see “Accessing the Coffee Shop Website” later in this section for download instructions and more details on this ongoing exercise. </p>

    <p class="H2_Body">Our objective is to have you finish this book with a solid understanding of HTML and CSS. We’ll accomplish this through a combination of resources, including the book itself, the development of the downloadable Coffee Shop website, and an array of other helpful and educational resources. </p>

    <p class="H2_Body">In addition to the Digital Asset Vault, we’re also hosting several essential resources on the ClydeBank Media GitHub page. Go to <a href="https://github.com/clydebankmedia">www.github.com/clydebankmedia</a>. Find the “htmlcss-quickstartguide” repository and click to open. Inside you will find all of our source code for this book. </p>

    <p class="H2_Body">This social code-sharing platform (GitHub) uses the popular Git s<span class="glossaryterm idGenCharOverride-1">ource code management</span> system. Using Git is helpful if you’re on a team, and it offers benefits for single-developer projects, but using the site’s greater functionalities isn’t essential at this stage of your learning. We’ll cover Git in detail in part IV of the book. For now, just jump right into our GitHub site and explore. You can’t break anything. </p>

    <p class="H2_Body">The source code inside the “htmlcss-quickstartguide” repository is organized by chapter and “Snippet number.” It should be easy to locate any snippet of code found in the book. Moreover, you are free to use any of our coding examples for your own website projects (figure 2).</p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-10"><a id="idTextAnchor007"/>Setting Up Your Workspace</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">One of the great things about working with HTML is that getting started requires nothing more than a text editor and a web browser. From a beginner’s perspective, it doesn’t matter which text editor and <span class="glossaryterm idGenCharOverride-1">web browser</span> you choose, but if you’re serious about your HTML training, you may want to acquire a few specific tools. I’ll mention some tools in asides or callouts, but for now, let’s begin with the basics.</p>

    <p class="H3">The Importance of Folder Structure</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Before you begin writing any code, it’s a good idea to create a folder or directory on your computer where all your website files will live. </p>

    <p class="H3_Body">While it is certainly possible to put all your files in one folder, this technique will get messy very quickly. Making good choices regarding site organization will save you time and frustration as your site grows. A small site, at a bare minimum, will have a directory for the HTML files (at least an index.html file), and a folder for CSS files and images. </p>

    <div class="whitebox">

      <figure class="horizontal-image-wrap" epub:type="z3998:figure">

        <img alt="" class="w-100" src="image/graphicLogo003.jpg"/>

        <img alt="" class="w-30" src="image/1.png"/>

      </figure>

      <p class="Caption">An HTML file, CSS folder, and image folder</p>

    </div>

    <p class="H3_Body">You may end up with far more files in your main directory. Moreover, if your website has multiple subsections, you will likely end up with specific directories for each subsection.</p>

    <p class="H3">Choosing a Text Editor</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">HTML files are simply text documents saved using the file extension <code class="CODE">.html</code> rather than <code class="CODE">.txt</code>. Any browser will display HTML files. Since HTML code is completely text-based, basic programs such as Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or gedit on Linux are perfectly valid options for an HTML coder (figure 4).</p>

    <div class="whitebox">

      <figure class="horizontal-image-wrap" epub:type="z3998:figure">

        <img alt="" class="w-100" src="image/graphicLogo004.jpg"/>

        <img alt="" class="w-100" src="image/figure4.jpg"/>

      </figure>

      <p class="Caption">Windows Notepad with a simple HTML file</p>

    </div>

    <p class="H3_Body">However, to make life easier, I recommend obtaining a good <span class="glossaryterm idGenCharOverride-1">code editor</span>. Code editors are text editors specifically designed for laying out HTML code (and other programming languages) in an organized fashion. They employ color coding, indentation, and a host of other features that aid coders in writing and maintaining code.</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Again, none of these tools is required to get started, but if you find it difficult to follow or read code in a standard text editor, give one of these programs a try.</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Here are the most popular text editors as of the time of publication. Many are free/open-source or available for a small price.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>

        <p class="marked-list-item">Visual Studio Code</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p class="marked-list-item">Notepad++</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p class="marked-list-item">Vim</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p class="marked-list-item">Emacs</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p class="marked-list-item">Sublime Text</p>

      </li>

    </ul>

    <p class="H3_Body">Each of these editors has its pros and cons, but if you’re having trouble deciding, I’d suggest installing both Visual Studio Code and Notepad++. It may seem strange to employ two editors, but I use Notepad++ for quick, single-file edits and the fully-featured Visual Studio Code for managing larger sites. Either can suit both scenarios, but these are my recommendations. At the end of the day, a coder’s choice of a text editor is a matter of personal preference, and most any option will be fine. If you want a clear-cut recommendation, then I’d say get Visual Studio Code text editor, as most examples and exercises in this book will depict that text editor in action (figure 5). </p>

    <div class="whitebox">

    <p class="H3">Popular Web Browsers</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">It’s hard to be a <span class="glossaryterm idGenCharOverride-1">web designer</span> without a web browser. Fortunately, all major operating systems include one. For Windows, the default is Edge; for macOS, it is Safari; and most Linux distributions include Firefox. At the time of publication, Google Chrome has the majority of the browser market share (figure 6).</p>

    <div class="whitebox">

      <p class="Caption">Browser market share as of October 2020</p>

      <p class="source">Source: gs.statcounter.com</p>

    </div>

    <p class="H3_Body">You can use any browser to get started, but it is essential to understand that different browsers may render content differently. When building a website, it is a best practice to test your results in multiple browsers to ensure that content renders according to your expectations. Some browsers allow a wider variety of coding styles for the sake of compatibility. In other words, they are more “forgiving” than others (as in, they allow you sloppier code and try to guess as to what you meant). Other browsers are stricter and require code to be structured in a precise way to display correctly.</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">If you do not want to spend time comparing different browsers, the easiest and safest pick at the time of publication is Google Chrome. Chrome is probably the best browser to work with at the moment because it firmly adheres to established web design standards. All of the browsers featured in figure 6 are available for free download.</p>

    <p class="H3">Image Editing Software</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">You are probably familiar with image editing software, from Adobe’s signature Photoshop to the very basic Microsoft Paint. You may not know, however, that image editing software is an essential component of your HTML workspace. Even if you are not planning on embarking on any significant graphic design work, you will still need to edit images so they will render optimally on the internet.</p>

    <p class="H3_Body"><span class="Semi-Bold idGenCharOverride-2">Sizing</span>:<span class="Semi-Bold idGenCharOverride-2"> </span>Image size is one of the essential considerations when editing images. Image files must be downloaded from the web by a browser, so failing to optimize your images can lead to slow load times for your website. Images captured on a camera or smartphone are too large to display on a website and must be resized by image editing software. </p>

    <p class="H3_Body"><span class="Semi-Bold idGenCharOverride-2">Format</span>: Many web browsers accept a wide array of image files, but .jpg, .png, and .gif are the most common. JPEG (.jpg) files are great for photos, while .png and .gif files work well for illustrations or smaller graphics. In cases where an image you want to use is not in the format you desire, image editing software helps you convert it to the desired format. </p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Image editors range widely in price and complexity. GIMP (the GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free and open-source alternative to Adobe Photoshop. Both Photoshop and GIMP can be very complicated to use, and if you are not a graphic designer, they can be a bit unwieldy. Microsoft Paint, Paint.net, and Paint++ are more basic choices that offer a simple but efficient set of features.</p>

        <p class="Note">The initial ClydeBank Coffee Shop website is terrible and needs a lot of love. We designed it this way on purpose so you would gain experience working with an existing website.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="H2_Body">Go ahead and download the sample “ClydeBank Coffee Shop” website, selected examples, images, and related files. They can all be downloaded easily from our GitHub account—<a href="https://github.com/clydebankmedia">www.github.com/clydebankmedia</a>. Look for the repository called “ClydeBank-Coffee-Shop” and click to open. </p>

      <p class="H2_Body">As previously noted, you will be given opportunities to steadily incorporate your newfound HTML and CSS knowledge into improving this website as we go along. Look for the green “<code class="CODEcondensed">↓</code>Code” icon, where you can download the ZIP file containing all code and graphic assets for the site. If you’re having trouble, see the walk-through in appendix V.</p>

      <p class="H2_Body">Believe it or not, you’ve already learned enough about HTML to get started with a simple hands-on exercise. In the directory you’ve downloaded, you’ll find a multitude of files: several <code class="CODE">.html</code> files, a <code class="CODE">.css</code> file, and some images. Each <code class="CODE">.html</code> file represents a website page. You’ll recognize the names of standard pages, such as “contact” and “events.” The <code class="CODE">index.html</code> file serves as the home page. The web server looks for an <code class="CODE">index.html</code> file as the default page to serve when a user navigates to the website (figure 7).
    </p>

      <div class="whitebox">

        <figure class="horizontal-image-wrap" epub:type="z3998:figure">

          <img alt="" class="w-100" src="image/graphicLogo007.jpg"/>

          <img alt="" class="w-30" src="image/4.png"/>

        </figure>

        <p class="Caption">The images used on the website and the .css files are placed in their own directories. Note that your browser icons may be different if Chrome is not your default browser.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="H2_Body">If you open the <code class="CODE">index.html</code> web page in your browser and click on the “about” link, you’ll notice its destination conspicuously missing. That means it’s referenced in the <code class="CODE">index.html</code> file but the <code class="CODE">about.html</code> page cannot be found. Let’s fix that now. </p>

      <p class="H2_Body">In your main website directory, you will find a <code class="CODE">template.html</code> file that can be copied to create your <code class="CODE">about.html</code> file. You will be developing this page later as you continue further down your path to HTML/CSS mastery. </p>

      <p class="H2_Body">Go ahead and copy the <code class="CODE">template.html</code> file and name it <code class="CODE">about.html</code>. It should be in the same directory as the <code class="CODE">index.html</code> file. If you’re able to complete this exercise on your own, great. If you’re having trouble, don’t worry. Once you grasp some core concepts, you’ll be fine. At the end of this book in appendix V, “ClydeBank Coffee Shop Solutions,” you’ll find walk-throughs for all of our coffee shop exercises, including this one.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">You don’t need much to code a website. Unlike with other programming, the barrier to entry is remarkably low. A text editor is the only requirement for coding HTML and CSS. As discussed in “Setting Up Your Workspace,” we’ll be using Visual Studio Code.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">If you have a laptop or desktop with a single monitor, you can drag the Visual Studio Code editor window to the left or right and split the screen with a web browser. If you would rather have each in a full screen, you can simply use ALT+TAB to cycle between them. If you are using multiple monitors, you can place your text editor and web browser on two different screens.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">In either case, we recommend having the <span class="italic idGenCharOverride-2">HTML &amp; CSS QuickStart Guide</span> beside your computer for easy reference. If you’re reading the e-book version, you can either ALT+TAB to it for reference or place it on a separate screen on a multi-monitor system (figure 8).</p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-12"><a id="idTextAnchor009"/>A Quick Tour of Visual Studio Code </h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">Visual Studio Code is a powerful code editor that provides a wide array of features for both beginners and experts. While it’s extremely useful for web design, it can also work with other languages like JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and more. Let’s download it and explore it together.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">The interface is divided into four sections. Not all sections are immediately visible upon launch. Notice that in figure 9, the index.html file of the ClydeBank Coffee Shop website is loaded in the large right pane. The HTML is colored to make the various elements in the code easy to see. </p>

    <p class="H2_Body">The thin left pane shows a display of the current files in the current working folder. This pane is called the Explorer and is not shown when you start the editor. If you wish to see your working folder of files, go to File &gt;&gt; Open Folder to open the folder with the HTML files of your choice. You may want to open the folder containing the ClydeBank Coffee Shop website files that you downloaded in this chapter. </p>

    <div class="whitebox">

      <figure class="horizontal-image-wrap" epub:type="z3998:figure">

        <img class="w-100" src="image/noteLogo.png"/>

      </figure>

      <p class="Note">You don’t have to use the explorer pane, but it makes it easy to switch between multiple files.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="H2_Body">On the far left side you’ll see a dark toolbar with various icons. The explorer icon at the top of this bar toggles the file explorer pane. The search icon (displayed as a magnifying glass) toggles a pane to search through your website’s files. The remaining icons focus more on source control (Git, discussed in chapter 16) and debugging features that don’t pertain to HTML and CSS.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">The final portion of the editor is the menu at the top of the application. Many of the various functions inside the editor are found in the menu, including the Open Folder command in the File menu. I encourage you to browse through the menu items to further explore the editor. Even if you don’t need all of the functions at the moment, it’s good to know where they are.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">There are various themes and extensions you can activate in Visual Studio Code to change its appearance and add functionality. You can access these and other configuration options with the settings icon (displayed as a gear in the bottom left corner of the screen on the toolbar). </p>

    <div class="standard-box">

      <figure class="horizontal-image-wrap" epub:type="z3998:figure">

        <img class="w-100" src="image/noteLogo.png"/>

      </figure>

      <p class="Note">Visual Studio Code is not limited to code files. You can also use it as a text editor. It is far more powerful than Notepad and can save you a lot of time. As you gain experience with the editor and explore its features on your own, you’ll feel more comfortable editing HTML and CSS. </p>

      </figure>

      <p class="Note">Visual Studio Code has many color themes and extensions that will make your web development even more enjoyable. Click on the gear icon in the bottom left-hand side menu and select Extensions to see what’s available. To explore the wide variety of color themes, click the funnel icon above the Extensions search bar and click Category, then Themes. You can also click Most Popular on the funnel icon to see the most-used extensions.</p>

      <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-13"><a id="idTextAnchor010"/>Getting the Most from This Book</h3>

      <p class="H2_Body">Learning HTML and CSS requires patience and commitment. No one’s learning path in this subject is identical to anyone else’s. In this book we’ve done our best to present a sensible pathway for you, but you will undoubtedly learn a great deal from your own ingenuity and experimentation. </p>

      <p class="H2_Body">We’d like to recommend three specific tips to aid your reading and learning experience:</p>

      <ol>

        <li class="Numbered-1" value="1">If you are struggling to fully understand a concept presented in this book, leave it be for a while. Skip ahead and move on. The book is laid out in such a way that you are sure to encounter one or more subsequent examples of the topic (often in the same section) that will help clarify the main point. Many elements in HTML depend on one another. This makes HTML somewhat challenging to teach in a linear fashion, but patient and persistent students will nibble away at the peripheries of complex topics until the bigger picture gradually comes into full focus. </li>

        <li class="Numbered-2-SA">At times, you will likely be tempted to veer off in a tangent of exploration inspired by a particular topic during the course of your reading. I recommend that you (a) go for it! Jump down the rabbit hole for a while and indulge your curiosity, but (b) don’t wander for too long. Set a time limit for yourself, after which you’ll return to the book and proceed with our prescribed learning structure. </li>

        <li class="Numbered-3-SA">I advise testing every HTML and CSS code example you see in this book. As stated before, you can access all source code for this book in the GitHub repository for the <span class="italic idGenCharOverride-2">HTML &amp; CSS QuickStart Guide</span>: <a href="http://www.github.com/clydebankmedia/htmlcss-quickstartguide">www.github.com/clydebankmedia/htmlcss-quickstartguide</a>. </li>

      </ol>

      <p class="H2_Body">Congratulations! You have started your journey toward becoming a master of HTML and CSS. I look forward to helping you get started in the exciting world of web design.</p>
