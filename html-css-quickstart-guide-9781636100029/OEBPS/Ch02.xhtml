    <p class="IntroParagraph">The concept of “markup language” predates the internet or even computers. Markup refers to a series of notes as instructions for how to handle textual content in a document. Markup existed in the early days of the printing press as a system developed by editors to communicate with the typesetter. The production editor would make a series of markup notes on a document to provide instructions to the typesetter pertaining to size, font, and other formatting concerns. As manual typesetting was replaced by more sophisticated machines and computers, the complexity of markup language increased as well.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">HTML behaves in the same manner as manual markup, except that the instructions provided are not interpreted by a person but by a web browser. As with any programming language, a machine interpreter does not have the intelligence or discretion of a human typesetter, so the instructions are always interpreted the same way regardless of the intent of the programmer. This chapter will give a brief overview of the inception of HTML, its development, and how it operates with web servers and web browsers. Although readers with an existing familiarity with HTML may already know this information, this chapter can serve as a good refresher.</p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-25"><a id="idTextAnchor022"/>A Brief History of HTML</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">HTML originated at the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (more commonly known as CERN, the European Council for Nuclear Research). CERN is most known for particle physics experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider. CERN needed a method by which to share and access digital documents internally across their intranet. Originally called SGML (standard generalized markup language), HTML functioned initially as an index system, including what today we would call “hyperlinks” that allowed the researchers to easily cross-reference documents.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">When HTML was created, web browsers were purely text-based. HTML offered a few basic markup tools, known as tags, to format text on a page and create a few links to other pages. An average user could learn HTML 1.0 in the course of an afternoon. It soon became possible for developers to add a few other elements to web pages, such as images and other forms of media. Some of the community’s additions to HTML have been retained for decades (such as iframes, a way to embed an HTML document inside of another HTML document), while others, such as “blink” (a rather annoying feature that made text flicker on the screen), were soon jettisoned due to lack of popularity.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">HTML evolved rapidly as a result of competition from large browser companies. This competition initially splintered the language, as different web browsers had varying degrees of support for new and evolving HTML features. Eventually, as web browsers themselves came and went, HTML was further consolidated and standardized until it reached the form we experience today. While there are still some variations “under the hood” in how different browsers handle HTML, these differences are minimal, and all browsers generally provide a similar experience to the user.</p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-26"><a id="idTextAnchor023"/>Current Use</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">HTML is used on a broad array of devices. Pretty much any computing device you can think of—desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile (and stationary) devices—use HTML in some way.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">While web browsers are the primary venues for rendering HTML, the markup language is also used by many popular email readers, such as those hosted through web-based services like Gmail.</p>

    <div class="standard-box">

      <figure class="horizontal-image-wrap" epub:type="z3998:figure">

        <img class="w-100" src="image/noteLogo.png"/>

      </figure>

      <p class="Note">HTML is often used in the displays found in stand-alone service kiosks in places such as airports, supermarkets, and libraries.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="H2_Body">While most HTML was originally written by hand, it is now typically generated by various backend languages that work through CMSs to create dynamic content. HTML has gone through several versions, but the vast majority of what worked in HTML 1.0 is still functional.</p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-27"><a id="idTextAnchor024"/>How It Works</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">To help explain how HTML works, let’s break it down into its parts. HTML, as defined earlier, stands for hypertext Mmarkup language. “Hypertext” simply refers to text that includes what we call “hyperlinks” or more often “links,” which are simple instructions that tell a web browser to move to a new page. “Markup” is text with HTML tags applied to it, such as <span class="Bold idGenCharOverride-1">bold</span> or <span class="italic idGenCharOverride-2">italicize</span>. HTML, like other languages, has predefined keywords that mean something specific to the web browser.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">HTML files themselves are simply text files named with a specific extension; usually it’s <code class="CODE">.html</code> (though there are a few other extensions that are acceptable, we will mainly be using the <code class="CODE">.html</code> extension in this book).</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">When a file is saved with this extension and then loaded into a web browser, the page will display as formatted according to the instructions in the markup.</p>

      </figure>

      <p class="Note">Here is a little experiment you can do right now in less than five minutes to demonstrate how simple it is to generate a basic web page. You will need your essential toolkit computer and Visual Studio Code for this task. You can also use another text editor like the Notepad application that comes with Windows. Open a new text document and enter the following text:</p>

      <div class="white2">

        <figure class="horizontal-image-wrap2" epub:type="z3998:figure">

          <img class="w-100" src="image/snipetLogo.jpg"/>

        </figure>

        <p class="snippet">02-01.html</p>

        <pre class="CODE_body">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</pre>

        <pre class="CODE_body">&lt;html&gt;</pre>

        <pre class="CODE_body">    &lt;body&gt;</pre>

        <pre class="CODE_body">        You can put any text you like in this section!</pre>

        <pre class="CODE_body">    &lt;/body&gt;</pre>

        <pre class="CODE_body">&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

      </div>

      <p class="Note">When you have finished typing, click “Save As” and name the file “test.html” and save it somewhere on your computer. When you are done, navigate to the file and open it. Your newly created HTML file should open in your default web browser. Congratulations! You have just created a web page. Obviously, this is a very rudimentary design and won’t be breaking the internet any time soon, but you can quickly improve it using the methods explained in this book. Stick around!</p>

    </div>

    <p class="H3">Web Servers</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">Websites on the internet are hosted on servers called <span class="glossaryterm idGenCharOverride-1">web servers</span>, which are computers that are hooked up to a network and make content available to users upon request. Web pages are served (delivered from host to end user) over a protocol known as HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol), by which a user, through the use of a web browser, makes a request to the server (using an HTTP request) and the server replies by sending an HTTP response to the web browser (figure 20).</p>

    <div class="whitebox">

      <figure class="horizontal-image-wrap" epub:type="z3998:figure">

        <img alt="" class="w-100" src="image/graphicLogo020.jpg"/>

        <img alt="" class="w-100" src="image/15.jpg"/>

      </figure>

    </div>

        <img class="w-100" src="image/noteLogo.png"/>

      </figure>

      <p class="Note">When you create your own HTML file and open it in a browser, you are essentially becoming your own web server. If you look at the address bar of the browser, it will show the file location on your computer. You can learn more about web hosting in appendix I, “Web Hosting.”</p>

    </div>

    <p class="H3">Web Browsers</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">At this point, you are probably familiar with the concept of a web browser and understand that web browsers read HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (figure 21). What you may not know is that every web browser approaches this process a bit differently. All web browsers contain an engine that takes the instructions provided in the markup (along with the locations of media, image files, video files, etc.) and generates a readable, integrated display that conforms to the instructions. But just like car engines that vary wildly in size, power, and design, the engines of web browsers can be “tuned” to provide different functions. Google Chrome, for example, runs a separate version of the browser for each browser tab you open. This prevents one bad page from crashing all your other tabs. Mozilla Firefox claims to have the most extensive API, or ability to create custom applications that run within the browser. Microsoft Edge claims to be the most energy-efficient browser. </p>

        <img class="w-100" src="image/noteLogo.png"/>

      </figure>

      <p class="Note">Many mobile devices have their own native web browsers (such as the Samsung Internet Browser). These mobile browsers all perform essentially the same function: reading HTML files and returning their CSS-formatted content in a consistent format.</p>

      </p>

    </div>

    <p class="H3">The HTML Itself</p>

    <p class="H3_Body">HTML code is essentially just text. As we demonstrated in our preview of HTML structure in chapter 1, markup elements always appear within brackets, beginning with “&lt;” and ending with “&gt;”. The entire web page lives within the element <code class="CODE">&lt;html&gt;</code>. That is to say that almost all the code for any given web page will be bookended by the following two tags: <code class="CODE">&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code class="CODE">&lt;/html&gt;</code>. HTML page structure is normally divided into two major sections. The “head,” which is labeled <code class="CODE">&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code class="CODE">&lt;/head&gt;</code>, includes all metadata about a site—a series of instructions to be given to the web browser. Everything that is visible on the page appears inside <code class="CODE">&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code class="CODE">&lt;/body&gt;</code>, which define (you guessed it) the body of the text.</p>

    </div>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-28"><a id="idTextAnchor025"/>Major Changes and Updates</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">HTML has gone through several major changes during its ever-evolving life cycle. These changes have followed a two-pronged strategy: increasing native HTML support for new features, and steadily shifting the responsibility of text and paragraph formatting over to CSS.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">For example, multimedia elements, such as <code class="CODE">&lt;audio&gt;</code>, which defines audio content, and <code class="CODE">&lt;video&gt;</code>, which defines video content, have been added to HTML, while some legacy elements that defined fonts and alignment directly within the HTML have been removed and shifted to CSS.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">As mentioned previously, HTML was initially developed for internal document management. Eventually, as networks spread beyond the confines of singular institutions, the driving force of HTML development came from web browser developers. Each web browser would interpret HTML very differently.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">Eventually, the creators of HTML realized that a standardized process and a group to oversee that process was needed, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was formed in October of 1994 (figure 22).</p>

    <div class="whitebox">

    </div>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-29"><a id="idTextAnchor026"/>HTML5</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">Each version of HTML added new features to the specification, but versions 4 and 5 added a whole new wave of functionality to the language. The biggest change with HTML5 is the standardization and demarcation of different roles within web development. Whereas in the past CSS and HTML tended to overlap, HTML5 enforces design and content separation.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">JavaScript, which was for years the unofficial programming language of the web (and was used in conjunction with HTML), became the formally accepted standard with the advent of HTML5.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">HTML5 also provides better multimedia support than did its predecessors, so there is no longer a need to use third-party plugins (for instance, Flash Player) to render videos or music. Also included within HTML5 is a wide range of user-submitted form enhancements and compatibility features to make writing web pages much easier.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">HTML5 gives certain elements a friendlier name. Elements like “header,” “footer,” “section,” “article,” etc., are directly defined in HTML5, negating the need to create and assign names to a placeholder element known as a <code class="CODE">&lt;div&gt;</code> (figure 23).</p>

    <h3 class="H2" id="idParaDest-30"><a id="idTextAnchor027"/>Future Development</h3>

    <p class="H2_Body">Like many technologies, HTML is a fluid specification with new advancements occurring on a regular basis. But though the language changes, many of the original principles remain the same. At the time of this book’s publication, HTML5 represents the most current iteration of the language, but most past elements of HTML still exist within HTML5 and are regularly used. Elements of the language do not, for the most part, become obsolete. Considering this trend, what we have sought to achieve in this book is to provide an evergreen tutorial resource for HTML, one that can be used as a reference and teaching aid for years to come.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">Some readers may wonder about the next iteration of HTML—presumably HTML6. The answer to that question is, as of now, unclear. There may not be an HTML6, at least not for quite a while. According to an influential standards-setting and monitoring community known as the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), HTML is best treated as a “living standard.”  WHATWG recommends that interested tech communities continually monitor the way people use HTML and seek to modify it slowly but responsively as usage evolves and new needs arise. Because of this incremental “living standard” approach to development, there may never be another formal release of a comprehensively overhauled language that warrants the title HTML6. Then again, only time will tell.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">As a coding language, HTML may remain quite unchanged for some time. Changes that occur to web development are more likely to relate to implementations of other languages, such as CSS and JavaScript. </p>
