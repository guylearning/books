    <p class="Chapter-Sub-title">DAVID DUROCHER</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">David DuRocher teaches web design and is a technical account manager at Adobe. A childhood love of video games helped fuel his passion to learn more about computers and programming languages. He attended the Rochester Institute of Technology and was later offered a teaching position at CUNY City College of Technology.</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">He enjoys teaching and developing web design curriculum, drawing great joy from seeing his students thrive with their newfound skills in HTML and CSS. His enthusiasm for education and a desire to share his knowledge led him to author this book.</p>
