    <p class="IntroParagraph">At some point, you will need to find a server to host your site. There is a wide range of places, from free to full-fledged dedicated hosting companies. The pricing typically depends on features. If you are doing simple HTML hosting, then you won’t need many resources, but it is worth doing some research to determine which hosts and plans will best suit your needs (figure 151).</p>

    <p class="H2_Body">When choosing a web host, you will likely want to consider the following features:</p>

    <ul class="marked1">

      <li>

        <p class="marked-list-item"><span class="Semi-Bold idGenCharOverride-2">Storage</span>: How much space is provided? Most HTML and CSS files are not large (they are just text files, after all), but if you have a site with many multimedia features or photos, you may need a lot of storage space.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p class="marked-list-item"><span class="Semi-Bold idGenCharOverride-2">Bandwidth</span>: Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be transferred from the servers hosting your site to the users requesting information from it. Typically, bandwidth is measured in one-billion-byte increments, called gigabytes (often abbreviated GB or GiB). Prices for bandwidth are given in tiers. Creating a website that receives a lot of traffic can end up being costly—especially if users are downloading large files beyond the simple graphics found on a basic web page (figure 152).</p>

      </li>

    </ul>

    </div>

    <ul>

      <li class="Bullets_H3"><span class="Semi-Bold idGenCharOverride-2">Uptime</span>: Will your website be available when people try to reach it? Web servers are far from infallible, and unforeseen circumstances like power outages, hardware failures, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are common problems with hosting. Even routine maintenance can take a server down for a small portion of each month. Web hosts usually calculate uptime as a percentage. A site with 99 percent uptime sounds like a great deal until you realize how much downtime that percentage is each month. Would a website that goes off-line fourteen minutes of every day be acceptable? What if the site had excellent daily uptime but went down for three days one year during a crucial time for your business? Both of those scenarios are possible within the limits of a 99 percent uptime guarantee (figure 153).</li>

        <p class="marked-list-item"><span class="Semi-Bold idGenCharOverride-2">Security</span>: If your website deals with the personal information of your customers, you will naturally be interested in security to keep that information safe. Website hosting companies offer a variety of safety and security features, which can include HTTPS, SSL certificates, content delivery networks (CDNs), firewalls, and attack protection.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p class="marked-list-item"><span class="Semi-Bold idGenCharOverride-2">Tech Support</span>: Good support is essential, especially for complex sites. You will need to be able to contact someone if something goes wrong or to find out if they have a solution that will meet a need.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p class="marked-list-item"><span class="Semi-Bold idGenCharOverride-2">Backup</span>: Does the host provide backup services that will preserve your website in the event of a server crash or other unanticipated incident?</p>

      </li>

    </ul>

    <p class="H2_Body">Some hosting companies offer services beyond providing a platform for HTML, CSS, and image files. You may need dynamically loading content from a database, or you may wish to connect your website to an email server and allow visitors to send email from a contact form.</p>

    <ul class="marked1">

      <li>

        <p class="marked-list-item"><span class="Semi-Bold idGenCharOverride-2">Database Support</span>: Can you create and use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL databases? WordPress requires one MySQL database. Some shared web hosting companies limit database size—something to keep in mind if you plan on building a large site with WordPress or a similar CMS.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p class="marked-list-item"><span class="Semi-Bold idGenCharOverride-2">SSH / Shell Access</span>: Can you do any command-line work on the server? This is helpful for Git and some PHP tools, such as Composer.</p>
