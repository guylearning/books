<h2 id="h225" class="calibre7"><b class="calibre1">So, What are Debits and Credits?</b>
</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p99">Debits and credits are simply the terms used for the two halves of each transaction. That is, each of these two-entry transactions involves a debit and a credit.</p>
<p id="p100" class="calibre2">Now, if you’ve been using a bank account for any period of time, you likely have an idea that debit means decrease while credit means increase. That is, however, not exactly true. A debit (or credit) to an account may increase it or decrease it, depending upon what type of account it is:</p>
<ul id="ul15" class="calibre23">
<li id="li53" class="calibre11">A debit entry will increase an asset account, and it will decrease a liability or owners’ equity account.         </li>
<li id="li54" class="calibre11">A credit entry will decrease an asset account, and it will increase a liability or owners’ equity account.  </li>
</ul>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p101">From the perspective of your bank, your checking account is a liability—that is, it’s money that they owe you. Because it’s a liability, your bank credits the account to increase the balance and debits the account to decrease the balance.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line37"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p102">Let’s apply this system of debits and credits to our earlier example.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line38"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p103"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> A company uses $40,000 cash to purchase a new piece of equipment. Cash will decrease by $40,000 and Equipment will increase by $40,000. To record this decrease to Cash (an asset account) we need to credit Cash for $40,000. To record this increase to Equipment (an asset account), we need to debit Equipment for $40,000.
</p>
<p id="p104" class="calibre2">This transaction could be recorded as a journal entry as follows:</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line108"></div>
<div class="table-table-layout-align-auto-width-auto" id="table-layout15">
<div class="galley" id="pc38">
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" id="t-2724" width="100%" class="calibre13">
<tbody class="calibre14">
<tr class="row">
<td class="col">DR. Equipment</td>
<td class="col"> </td>
<td class="col">40,000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row">
<td class="col">         CR. Cash</td>
<td class="col"> </td>
<td class="col">         40,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p105">As you can see, when recording a journal entry, the account that is debited is listed first, and the account that is credited is listed second, with an indentation to the right. Also, debit is conventionally abbreviated as “DR” and credit is abbreviated as “CR.” (Often, these abbreviations are omitted, and credits are signified entirely by the fact that they are indented to the right.)</p>
<p id="p106" class="calibre2">An easy way to keep everything straight is to think of “debit” as meaning “left,” and “credit” as meaning “right.” In other words, debits increase accounts on the left side of the accounting equation, and credits increase accounts on the right side. Also, this helps you to remember that the debit half of a journal entry is on the left, while the credit half is indented to the right.</p>
<p id="p107" class="calibre2">Let’s take a look at a few more example transactions and see how they would be recorded as journal entries.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line39"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p108"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> Chris’ Construction takes out a $50,000 loan with a local bank. Cash will increase by $50,000, and Notes Payable will increase by $50,000. To increase Cash (an asset account), we will debit it. To increase Notes Payable (a liability account), we will credit it.

<td class="col">          CR. Notes Payable</td>
<td class="col"> </td>
<td class="col">        50,000</td>

</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p109"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> Last month, Chris’ Construction purchased $10,000 worth of building supplies, using credit to do so. Building Supplies (asset) and Accounts Payable (liability) each need to be increased by $10,000. To do so, we’ll debit Building Supplies, and credit Accounts Payable.

<p class="firstpara1" id="p110">Eventually, Chris’s Construction will pay the vendor for the supplies. When they do, we’ll need to decrease Accounts Payable and Cash by $10,000 each. To decrease a liability, we debit it, and to decrease an asset, we credit it.</p>
