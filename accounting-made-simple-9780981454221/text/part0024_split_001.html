</h1>

<p class="calibre2" id="indent-para21">The goal of accounting is to provide people—both internal users (managers, owners) and external users (creditors, investors)—with information about a company’s finances. This information is provided in the form of financial statements. These financial statements are compiled using information found in the general ledger, which is, essentially, the collection of all of a business’s journal entries.</p>
<p id="p233" class="calibre2">In this way, we can see that it’s the humble little journal entry (and its respective components: debits and credits) that provides the information upon which decisions are made in the world of business. Tens of billions of dollars change hands every day based ultimately upon the journal entries recorded by accountants—and accounting software—around the world.</p>
<p id="p234" class="calibre2">These journal entries are based, in turn, upon the framework provided by the accounting equation and the double-entry accounting system that goes along with it.</p>
<p id="p235" class="calibre2">Meanwhile, it’s the guidelines provided by GAAP that make these journal entries (and the financial statements they eventually make up) meaningful. Because without the consistency of accounting provided for by GAAP, making a worthwhile comparison between two companies’ financial statements would prove impossible.</p>
