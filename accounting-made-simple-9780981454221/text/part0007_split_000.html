<p class="calibre2" id="indent-para1">Like the other books in the <i class="calibre5">“…in 100 Pages or Less” </i> series, this book is designed to give you a basic understanding of the topic (in this case, accounting), and do it as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p id="p49" class="calibre2">To be clear, the only way to pack a topic such as accounting into just 100 pages is to be as brief as possible. In other words, the goal is <i class="calibre5">not</i> to turn you into an expert. With 100 pages, it’s simply not possible to provide a comprehensive discussion of every topic in the field of accounting.
</p>
<p id="p50" class="calibre2">That said, I <i class="calibre5">am</i> optimistic that this book will help you achieve a decent understanding of the most fundamental accounting concepts. (And, as explained more fully just before the table of contents, you’re welcome to email me for a refund if you find yourself unsatisfied with the book.)
