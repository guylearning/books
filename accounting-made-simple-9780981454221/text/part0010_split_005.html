</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara91">Often, the assets and liabilities on a balance sheet will be broken down into current assets (or liabilities) and long-term assets (or liabilities). Current assets are those that are expected to be converted into cash within 12 months or less. Typical current assets include Accounts Receivable, Cash, and Inventory.</p>
<p id="p60" class="calibre2">Everything that isn’t a current asset is, by default, a long-term asset (a.k.a. non-current asset). For example, Property, Plant, and Equipment is a long-term asset account.</p>
<p id="p61" class="calibre2">Current liabilities are those that will need to be paid off within 12 months or less. The most common example of a current liability is Accounts Payable. Notes Payable that are paid off over a period of time are split up on the balance sheet so that the next 12 months’ payments are shown as a current liability, while the remainder of the note is shown as a long-term liability.</p>
