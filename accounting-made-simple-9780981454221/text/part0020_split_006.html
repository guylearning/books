<h2 id="h239" class="calibre7"><b class="calibre1">Matching Principle</b>
</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p172">According to GAAP, the matching principle dictates that expenses must be matched to the revenues that they help generate, and they must be recorded in the same period in which the revenues are recorded. This concept goes hand-in-hand with the concept of accrual accounting. For example, it’s the matching principle that dictates that a company’s utility expenses for the month of March must be recorded in March (rather than in April, when they are likely paid). The reasoning is that March’s utility expenses contribute to the production of March’s revenues, so they must be recorded in March.</p>
<p id="p173" class="calibre2">Similarly, it is the matching principle that dictates that if a company purchases an asset that is expected to provide benefit to the company for multiple accounting periods (a desk, for instance), the cost of the asset must be spread out over the period for which it is expected to provide benefits. This process is known as depreciation, and we’ll discuss it more thoroughly in Chapter 12.</p>

</h3>

<ul id="ul19" class="calibre17">
<li id="li66" class="calibre11">An asset’s historical cost is often quite different from its current market value. However, due to its objective nature, historical cost is generally used when reporting the value of assets under GAAP.</li>
<li id="li67" class="calibre11">A transaction is said to be immaterial if an omission of the transaction would not result in a significant misstatement of the company’s financial statements.</li>
<li id="li68" class="calibre11">Under GAAP, in order to simplify accounting, currency is generally assumed to have a stable value. This is known as the monetary unit assumption.</li>
<li id="li69" class="calibre11">For GAAP accounting, a business is considered to be an entirely separate entity from its owners. This is known as the entity concept or entity assumption.</li>
<li id="li70" class="calibre11">According to GAAP’s matching principle, expenses must be reported in the same period as the revenues which they help produce.</li>
