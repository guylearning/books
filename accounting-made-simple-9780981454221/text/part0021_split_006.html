<p class="firstpara1" id="p197">The concept of materiality plays a big role in how some assets are accounted for. For example, consider the case of a $15 wastebasket. Given the fact that a wastebasket is almost certain to last for greater than one year, it should, theoretically, be depreciated over its expected useful life.</p>
<p id="p198" class="calibre2">However, in terms of the impact on the company’s financial statements, the difference between depreciating the wastebasket and expensing the entire cost right away is clearly negligible. The benefit of the additional accounting accuracy is far outweighed by the hassle involved in making insignificant depreciation journal entries year after year. As a result, assets of this nature are generally expensed immediately upon purchase rather than depreciated over multiple years. Such a purchase would ordinarily be recorded as follows:</p>

<ul id="ul20" class="calibre17">
<li id="li73" class="calibre11">Straight-line depreciation is the simplest depreciation method. Using straight-line, an asset’s cost is depreciated over its expected useful life, with an equal amount of depreciation being recorded each month.</li>
<li id="li74" class="calibre11">Accumulated depreciation—a contra-asset account—is used to keep track of how much depreciation has been recorded against an asset so far.</li>
<li id="li75" class="calibre11">An asset’s net book value is equal to its original cost, less the amount of accumulated depreciation that has been recorded against the asset.</li>
<li id="li76" class="calibre11">If an asset is sold for <i class="calibre5">more</i> than its net book value, a gain must be recorded. If it’s sold for <i class="calibre5">less</i> than net book value, a loss is recorded.
</li>
<li id="li77" class="calibre11">Immaterial asset purchases tend to be expensed immediately rather than being depreciated.</li>
