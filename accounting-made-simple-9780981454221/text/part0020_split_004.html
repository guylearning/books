</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p169">GAAP makes the assumption that the dollar is a stable measure of value. Itâ€™s no secret that this is a faulty assumption due to inflation constantly changing the real value of the dollar. The reason for using such a flawed assumption is that the benefit gained from adjusting the value of assets on a regular basis to reflect inflation would be far outweighed by the cost in both time and money of requiring companies to do so.</p>
