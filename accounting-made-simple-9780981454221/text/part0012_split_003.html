</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p70">When first learning accounting, many people are tempted to classify dividend payments as an expense. Itâ€™s true, they do look a lot like an expense in that they are a cash payment made from the company to another party.</p>
<p id="p71" class="calibre2">Unlike many other cash payments, however, dividends are a <i class="calibre5">distribution</i> of profits (as opposed to expenses, which reduce profits). Because they are not a part of the calculation of net income, dividend payments do not show up on the income statement. Instead, they appear on the statement of retained earnings.
