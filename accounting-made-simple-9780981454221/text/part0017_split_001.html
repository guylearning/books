<p class="calibre2" id="indent-para14">Most people (without knowing it) use a system of accounting known as single-entry accounting when they record transactions relating to their checking or savings accounts. For each transaction, one entry is made (either an increase or decrease in the balance of cash in the account).</p>
<p id="p93" class="calibre2">Likely the single most important aspect of GAAP is the use of double-entry accounting, and the accompanying system of debits and credits. With double-entry accounting, each transaction results in two entries being made. (These two entries collectively make up what is known as a “journal entry.”)</p>
<p id="p94" class="calibre2">This is actually fairly intuitive when you think back to the accounting equation:</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line34"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p95">Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line35"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p96">If each transaction resulted in only one entry, the equation would no longer balance. That’s why, with each transaction, entries will be recorded to two accounts.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line36"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p97"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> A company uses $40,000 cash to purchase a new piece of equipment. In the journal entry to record this transaction, Cash will decrease by $40,000 and Equipment will increase by $40,000. As a result, the “Assets” side of the equation will have a net change of zero, and nothing changes at all on the “Liabilities + Owners’ Equity” side of the equation.

<p class="firstpara1" id="p98">Alternatively, if the company had purchased the equipment with a loan, the journal entry would be an increase to Equipment of $40,000 and an increase to Notes Payable of $40,000. In this case, each side of the equation would have increased by $40,000.</p>
