<h2 id="h214" class="calibre7"><b class="calibre1">Cash Flow Statement vs. Income Statement</b>
</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara102">At first, it may sound as if a cash flow statement fulfills the same purpose as an income statement. There are, however, some important differences between the two.</p>
<p id="p73" class="calibre2">First, there are often differences in timing between when an income or expense item is recorded and when the cash actually comes in or goes out the door. We’ll discuss this topic more thoroughly in Chapter 9: Cash vs. Accrual. For now, let’s just consider a brief example.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line26"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p74"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE: </b> In September, XYZ Consulting performs marketing services for a customer who does not pay until the beginning of October. In September, this sale would be recorded as an increase in both Sales and Accounts Receivable. (And the sale would show up on a September income statement.)
</p>
<p id="p75" class="calibre2">The cash, however, isn’t actually received until October, so the activity would not appear on September’s cash flow statement.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line27"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara103">The second major difference between the income statement and the cash flow statement is that the cash flow statement includes several types of transactions that are not included in the income statement.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line28"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara104"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE: </b> XYZ Consulting takes out a loan with its bank. The loan will not appear on the income statement, as the transaction is neither a revenue item nor an expense item. It is simply an increase of an asset (Cash) and a liability (Notes Payable). However, because it’s a cash inflow, the loan <i class="calibre5">will</i> appear on the cash flow statement.
</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line29"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara105"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE: </b> XYZ Consulting pays its shareholders a $30,000 dividend. As discussed in Chapter 4, dividends are not an expense. Therefore, the dividend will not appear on the income statement. It will, however, appear on the cash flow statement as a cash outflow.
