</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara93">Gross profit refers to the sum of a company’s revenues, minus Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS) is the amount that the company paid for the goods that it sold over the course of the period.</p>

<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara94"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE</b>: Laura runs a small business selling t-shirts with band logos on them. At the beginning of the month, Laura ordered 100 t-shirts for $12 each. By the end of the month, she had sold all of the shirts for a total of $2,500. For the month, Laura’s Cost of Goods Sold is $1,200, and her gross profit is $1,300.<sup class="calibre16"><a href="part0025.html#p245" class="calibre4">4</a></sup>

<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara95"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE: </b> Rich runs a small business preparing tax returns. All of his costs are overhead—that is, each additional return he prepares adds nothing to his total costs—so he has no Cost of Goods Sold. His gross profit is simply equal to his revenues.
