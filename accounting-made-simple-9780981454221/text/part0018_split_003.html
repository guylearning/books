<h2 id="h231" class="calibre7"><b class="calibre1">The Accrual Method</b>
</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p128">Under the accrual method of accounting, revenue is recorded as soon as services are provided or goods are delivered, regardless of when cash is received. (Note: This is why we use an Accounts Receivable account.)</p>
<p id="p129" class="calibre2">Similarly, under the accrual method of accounting, expenses are recognized as soon as the company receives goods or services, regardless of when it actually pays for them. (Accounts Payable is used to record these as-yet-unpaid obligations.)</p>
<p id="p130" class="calibre2">The goal of the accrual method is to fix the major shortcoming of the cash method: distortions of economic reality due to the frequent time lag between a service being performed and the service being paid for.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line43"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p131"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> Mario runs an electronics store. On the 5<sup class="calibre16">th</sup> of every month, he pays his sales reps their commissions for sales made in the prior month. In August, his sales reps earned total commissions of $93,000. If Mario uses the accrual method of accounting, he must make the following entry at the end of August:
</p>
<div class="table-table-layout-align-auto-width-auto" id="table-layout22">
<div class="galley" id="pc48">
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" id="t-3112" width="100%" class="calibre13">
<tbody class="calibre14">
<tr class="row">
<td class="col">Commissions Expense</td>
<td class="col"> </td>
<td class="col">93,000</td>

<tr class="row">
<td class="col">          Commissions Payable</td>
<td class="col"> </td>
<td class="col">         93,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p132">Whenever an expense is recorded prior to its being paid for—such as in the above entry—the journal entry is referred to as an “accrual,” hence, the “accrual method.” The need for the above entry could be stated by saying that, at the end of August, “Mario has to accrue for $93,000 of Commissions Expense.”</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line44"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p133">Then, on the 5<sup class="calibre16">th</sup> of September, when he pays his reps for August, he must make the following entry:
</p>
<div class="table-table-layout-align-auto-width-auto" id="table-layout23">
<div class="galley" id="pc49">
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" id="t-3140" width="100%" class="calibre13">
<tbody class="calibre14">
<tr class="row">
<td class="col">Commissions Payable</td>
<td class="col"> </td>
<td class="col">93,000</td>

<tr class="row">
<td class="col">          Cash</td>
<td class="col"> </td>
<td class="col">         93,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p134">A few points are worthy of specific mention. First, because Mario uses the accrual method, the expense is recorded when the services are performed, regardless of when they are paid for. This ensures that any financial statements for the month of August reflect the appropriate amount of Commissions Expense for sales made during the month.</p>
<p id="p135" class="calibre2">Second, after both entries have been made, the net effect is a debit to the relevant expense account and a credit to Cash. (Note how this is exactly what you’d expect for an entry recording an expense.)</p>
<p id="p136" class="calibre2">Last point of note: Commissions Payable will have no net change after both entries have been made. Its only purpose is to make sure that financial statements prepared at the end of August would reflect that—at that particular moment—an amount is owed to the sales reps.</p>
<p id="p137" class="calibre2">Let’s run through a few more examples so you can get the hang of it.</p>
