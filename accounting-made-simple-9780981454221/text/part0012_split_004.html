</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara101">The definition of retained earnings—the sum of a company’s undistributed profits over the entire existence of the company—makes it sound as if a company’s Retained Earnings balance must be sitting around somewhere as cash in a checking or savings account. In all likelihood, however, that isn’t the case at all.</p>
<p id="p72" class="calibre2">Just because a company hasn’t distributed its profits to its owners doesn’t mean it hasn’t already used them for something else. For instance, profits are frequently reinvested in growing the company by purchasing more inventory for sale or purchasing more equipment for production.</p>

<li id="li24" class="calibre11">Dividend payments are not an expense. They are a distribution of profits.</li>
<li id="li25" class="calibre11">Retained earnings is not the same as cash. Often, a significant portion of a company’s retained earnings is spent on attempts to grow the company.</li>
