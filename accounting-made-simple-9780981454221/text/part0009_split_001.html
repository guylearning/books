<p class="calibre2" id="indent-para2">Before you can create financial statements, you need to first understand the single most fundamental concept of accounting: the accounting equation.</p>
<p id="p52" class="calibre2">The accounting equation states that at all times, and without exceptions, the following will be true:</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line100"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara73">Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line9"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara74">So what does that mean? Let’s take a look at the equation piece by piece.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line10"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara75"><b class="calibre6">Assets:</b> All of the property owned by the company.
</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line11"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara76"><b class="calibre6">Liabilities:</b> All of the debts that the company currently has outstanding to lenders.
</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line12"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara77"><b class="calibre6">Owners’ Equity (a.k.a. Shareholders’ Equity): </b> The company’s ownership interest in its assets, after all debts have been repaid.
</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line13"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara78">Let’s use a simple, everyday example: homeownership.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line14"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara79"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> Lisa owns a $300,000 home. To pay for the home, she took out a mortgage, on which she still owes $230,000. Lisa would be said to have $70,000 “equity in the home.” Applying the accounting equation to Lisa’s situation would give us this:

<div class="galley" id="pc1">
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" id="t-340" width="100%" class="calibre13">

</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara80">In other words, owners’ equity (the part that often confuses people) is just a plug figure. It’s simply the leftover amount after paying off the liabilities/debts. So while the accounting equation is conventionally written as:</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line15"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara81">Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity,</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line16"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara82">…it might be easier to think of it this way:</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line17"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara83">Assets – Liabilities = Owners’ Equity</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line18"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara84">If, one year later, Lisa had paid off $15,000 of her mortgage, her accounting equation would now appear as follows:</p>
<div class="table-table-layout-align-auto-width-auto" id="table-layout2">
<div class="galley" id="pc2">
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" id="t-386" width="100%" class="calibre13">
<tbody class="calibre14">
<tr class="row">
<td class="col">             Assets</td>
<td class="col">=</td>
<td class="col">Liabilities</td>
<td class="col">+</td>
<td class="col">Owners’ Equity</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row">
<td class="col">         $300,000</td>
<td class="col">=</td>
<td class="col">$215,000</td>
<td class="col">+</td>
<td class="col">$85,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p53">Because her liabilities have gone down by $15,000—and her assets have not changed—her owner’s equity has, by default, increased by $15,000.</p>
