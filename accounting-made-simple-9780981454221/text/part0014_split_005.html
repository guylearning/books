</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara118">It’s obviously risky for a company to be very highly leveraged (that is, financed largely with debt). There is, however, something to be gained from using leverage. The more highly leveraged a company is, the greater its return on equity will be for a given amount of net income. That may sound confusing; let’s look at an example.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line32"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara119"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE: </b> XYZ Software has $200 million of assets, $100 million of liabilities, and $100 million of owners’ equity. XYZ’s net income for the year is $15 million, giving them a return on equity of 15% ($15 million net income divided by $100 million owners’ equity).
</p>
<p id="p87" class="calibre2">If, however, XYZ Software’s capital structure was more debt-dependent—such that they had $150 million of liabilities and only $50 million of equity—their return on equity would now be much greater. In fact, with the same net income, XYZ would have a return on equity of 30% ($15 million net income divided by $50 million owners’ equity), thereby offering the company’s owners twice as great a return on their money.</p>
<p id="p88" class="calibre2">In other words, when the company’s debt-to-equity ratio increased (from 1 in the first example to 3 in the second example), the company’s return on equity increased as well, even though net income remained the same.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line33"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara120">In short, the question of leverage is a question of balance. Being more highly leveraged (i.e., more debt, less investment from shareholders) allows for a greater return on the shareholders’ investment. On the other hand, financing a company primarily with loans is obviously a risky way to run a business.</p>
