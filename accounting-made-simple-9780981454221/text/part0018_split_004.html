</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p145">So far, all of our examples have looked at scenarios in which the cash exchange occurred <i class="calibre5">after</i> the goods/services were delivered. Naturally, there are occasions in which the opposite situation arises.
</p>
<p id="p146" class="calibre2">Again, the goal of the accrual method is to record the revenues or expenses in the period during which the real economic transaction occurs (as opposed to the period in which cash is exchanged). Let’s revisit our earlier example of Pam with the ice cream store.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line47"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p147"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> Pam’s monthly rent is $1,500. However, Pam’s landlord—Retail Rentals—requires that she prepay her rent for the next 3 months at the beginning of every quarter. On April 1<sup class="calibre16">st</sup>, Pam writes a check for $4,500 (rent for April, May, and June). She makes the following entry:
</p>
<div class="table-table-layout-align-auto-width-auto" id="table-layout29">
<div class="galley" id="pc55">
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" id="t-3330" width="100%" class="calibre13">
<tbody class="calibre14">
<tr class="row">
<td class="col">Prepaid Rent</td>
<td class="col"> </td>
<td class="col">4,500</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row">
<td class="col">         Cash</td>
<td class="col"> </td>
<td class="col">          4,500</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p148">In the above entry, Prepaid Rent is an asset account. Over the course of the three months, the $4,500 will be eliminated as the expense is recorded. Assets caused by the prepayment of an expense are known, understandably, as “prepaid expense accounts.”</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line48"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p149">Then, at the end of each month (April, May, and June), Pam will make the following entry to record her rent expense for the period:</p>
<div class="table-table-layout-align-auto-width-auto" id="table-layout30">
<div class="galley" id="pc56">
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" id="t-3357" width="100%" class="calibre13">

<tr class="row">
<td class="col">Rent Expense</td>
<td class="col"> </td>
<td class="col">1,500</td>

<tr class="row">
<td class="col">          Prepaid Rent</td>
<td class="col"> </td>
<td class="col">           1,500</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p150">Again, by the end of the three months, Prepaid Rent will be back to zero, and she will have recognized the proper amount of Rent Expense each month ($1,500). Of course, the process will start all over again on July 1<sup class="calibre16">st</sup> when Pam prepays her rent for the third quarter of the year.
