</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p165">Under GAAP, the materiality (or immateriality) of a transaction refers to the impact that the transaction will have on the company’s financial statements. If an omission of a given transaction could cause a viewer of the company’s financial statements to make a different decision than he or she would make if the transaction were reported correctly, the transaction is said to be “material.”</p>

<p class="firstpara1" id="p166"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> Martin’s business currently has $50,000 of current assets, $20,000 of current liabilities, and owes $75,000 on a loan that will be due in 2 years. The loan is clearly material, as an exclusion of the amount from the company’s balance sheet would very likely lead a potential investor (or creditor) to make a poor decision regarding investing in (or lending money to) the company.
</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line53"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p167"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> Carly runs a graphic design business. Her monthly revenues are usually around $20,000, and her monthly expenses are approximately $8,000. In August, Carly purchases $80 worth of office supplies, but she forgets to record the purchase.
</p>
<p id="p168" class="calibre2">While Carly should certainly make sure to record the purchase once she notices her error, the $80 expense is clearly immaterial. If creditors were looking at her financial statements at the end of August, the $80 understatement of expenses would be unlikely to cause them to make a different decision than they would make if the expense had been accurately recorded.</p>
