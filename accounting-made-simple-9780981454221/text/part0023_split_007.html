<h2 id="h251" class="calibre7"><b class="calibre1">Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)</b>
</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p216">Under the “Last-In, First-Out” method, the opposite assumption is made. That is, we assume that all of the newest inventory is sold before any older units of inventory are sold. So, in the above example, we’d assume that Maggie sold all of her $3.50 shirts before selling any of her $3 shirts.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line64"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p217"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE (CONTINUED):</b> At the beginning of April, Maggie’s inventory consisted of 50 shirts—all of which had been purchased at $3 per shirt. Over the month, she purchased 100 shirts, 60 at $3 per shirt, and 40 at $3.50 per shirt. In total, Maggie’s Goods Available for Sale for April consists of 110 shirts at $3 per shirt, and 40 shirts at $3.50 per shirt.
</p>
<p id="p218" class="calibre2">If Maggie were to use the <b class="calibre6">FIFO</b> method of calculating her CoGS for the 100 shirts she sold in April, her CoGS would be $300. (She had 110 shirts that cost $3, and FIFO assumes that all of the older units are sold before any newer units are sold.)
</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line65"></div>
<p class="middle" id="middle5">100 x 3 = 300</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line66"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p219">If Maggie were to use the <b class="calibre6">LIFO</b> method of calculating her CoGS for the 100 shirts she sold in April, her CoGS would be $320. (LIFO assumes that all 40 of the newer, $3.50 shirts would have been sold, and the other 60 must have been $3 shirts.)
</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line67"></div>
<p class="middle" id="middle6">(40 x 3.5) + (60 x 3) = 320</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line68"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p220">It’s important to note that the two methods result not only in different Cost of Goods Sold for the period, but in different ending inventory balances as well.</p>
<p id="p221" class="calibre2">Under FIFO—because we assumed that all 100 of the sold shirts were the older, $3, shirts—it would be assumed that, at the end of April, her 50 remaining shirts would be made up of 10 shirts that were purchased at $3 each, and 40 that were purchased at $3.50 each. Grand total ending inventory balance: $170.</p>
<p id="p222" class="calibre2">In contrast, the LIFO method would assume that—because all of the newer shirts were sold—the remaining shirts must be the older, $3 shirts. As such, Maggie’s ending inventory balance under LIFO is $150.</p>
