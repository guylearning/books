</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p202">Any business that keeps real-time information on inventory levels and that tracks inventory on an item-by-item basis is using the perpetual method. For example, retail locations that use barcodes and point-of-sale scanners are utilizing the perpetual inventory method.</p>
<p id="p203" class="calibre2">There are two main advantages to using the perpetual inventory system. First, it allows a business to see exactly how much inventory they have on hand at any given moment, thereby making it easier to know when to order more. Second, it improves the accuracy of the companyâ€™s financial statements because it allows very accurate recordkeeping as to the Cost of Goods Sold over a given period. (CoGS will simply be calculated as the sum of the costs of all of the particular items sold over the period.)</p>
<p id="p204" class="calibre2">The primary disadvantage to using the perpetual method is the cost of implementation.</p>
