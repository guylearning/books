<p class="firstpara1" id="p119">In many situations, it can be useful to look at all the activity that has occurred in a single account over a given time period. The tool most frequently used to provide this one-account view of activity is known as the “T-Account.” One look at an example T-account and you’ll know where it gets its name:</p>
<div class="media-image-align-center-width-fixed" id="image17">
<div class="galley" id="pc45">
<img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre24"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p120">The above T-account shows us that, over the period in question, Cash has been debited for $400, $550, and $300, as well as credited for $200 and $950.</p>
<p id="p121" class="calibre2">Often, a T-account will include the account’s beginning and ending balances:</p>
<div class="media-image-align-center-width-fixed" id="image18">
<div class="galley" id="pc46">
<img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre24"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p122">This T-account shows us that at the beginning of the period, Inventory had a debit balance of $600. It was then debited for a total of $750 (250+500) and credited for a total of $500 (200+300). As a result, Inventory had a debit balance of $850 at the end of the period ($600 beginning balance, plus $250 net debit over the period).</p>
