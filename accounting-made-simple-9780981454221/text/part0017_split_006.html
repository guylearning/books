</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p123">A trial balance is simply a list indicating the balances of every single general ledger account at a given point in time. The trial balance is typically prepared at the end of a period, prior to preparing the primary financial statements.</p>
<p id="p124" class="calibre2">The purpose of the trial balance is to check that debits—in total—are equal to the total amount of credits. If debits do not equal credits, you know that an erroneous journal entry must have been posted. While a trial balance is a helpful check, it’s far from perfect, as there are numerous types of errors that a trial balance doesn’t catch. (For example, a trial balance wouldn’t alert you if the wrong asset account had been debited for a given transaction, as the error wouldn’t throw off the <i class="calibre5">total</i> amount of debits.)
