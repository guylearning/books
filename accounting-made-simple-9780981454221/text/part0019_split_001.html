<p class="calibre2" id="indent-para16">As you know, the purpose of the Retained Earnings account is to show all of the net income that a business has earned over its life, excluding any income that has been distributed to shareholders. What we haven’t yet discussed, however, is how any amounts actually <i class="calibre5">get into</i> the Retained Earnings account.

<p id="p155" class="calibre2">In addition, you know that the point of using revenue and expense accounts is to track the operations of a business over a period of time. But we have not yet discussed how, for example, <i class="calibre5">this</i> year’s rent expense is separated from <i class="calibre5">last</i> year’s rent expense, given that both are recorded in the same account.
