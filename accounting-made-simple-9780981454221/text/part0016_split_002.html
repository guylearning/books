</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p91">All publicly traded companies are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to follow GAAP procedures when preparing their financial statements. In addition, because of GAAPâ€™s prevalence in the field of accounting, many companies follow GAAP even when they are not required to do so.</p>
<p id="p92" class="calibre2">Governmental entities are required to follow GAAP as well. That said, there is a different set of GAAP guidelines (created by a different regulatory body) for government organizations. So, while they are following GAAP, their financial statements are quite different from those of public companies.</p>
