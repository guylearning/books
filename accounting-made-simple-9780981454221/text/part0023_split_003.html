</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p205">The periodic method of inventory is a system in which inventory is counted at regular intervals (at month-end, for instance). Using this method, a business will know how much inventory it has at the beginning and end of every period, but it won’t know precisely how much inventory is on hand in the middle of an accounting period.</p>
<p id="p206" class="calibre2">A second drawback of the periodic method is that the business won’t be able to track inventory on an item-by-item basis, thereby requiring assumptions to be made as to which particular items of inventory were sold. (More on these assumptions later.)</p>
