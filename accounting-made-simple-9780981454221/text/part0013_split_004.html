</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara107">Technically, cash flow from operating activities includes any cash flows not specifically defined as investing or financing activities. The general idea, however, is to reflect most of the cash transactions that would be included in the determination of net income.</p>
<p id="p76" class="calibre2">Common items that are categorized as cash flow from operating activities include:</p>
<ul id="ul9" class="calibre23">
<li id="li29" class="calibre11">Receipts from the sale of goods or services, </li>
<li id="li30" class="calibre11">Payments made to suppliers, </li>
<li id="li31" class="calibre11">Payments made to employees, </li>
<li id="li32" class="calibre11">Interest payments made to lenders, </li>
<li id="li33" class="calibre11">Interest or dividends received from investments, and  </li>
<li id="li34" class="calibre11">Tax payments.</li>
