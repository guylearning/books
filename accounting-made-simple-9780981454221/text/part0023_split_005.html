</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p212">Of course, the calculation of CoGS is a bit more complex out in the real world. For example, if a business is dealing with changing per-unit inventory costs, assumptions have to be made as to which ones were sold (the cheaper units or the more expensive units).</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line63"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p213"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> Maggie has a business selling t-shirts online. She gets all of her inventory from a single vendor. In the middle of April, the vendor raises its prices from $3 per shirt to $3.50 per shirt. If Maggie sells 100 shirts during April—and she has no way of knowing which of those shirts were purchased at which price—should her CoGS be $300, $350, or somewhere in between?
</p>
<p id="p214" class="calibre2">The answer depends upon which inventory-valuation method is used. The three most-used methods are known as FIFO, LIFO, and Average Cost. Under GAAP, a business can use any of the three.</p>
