</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara121">Asset turnover ratios seek to show how efficiently a company uses its assets. The two most commonly used turnover ratios are inventory turnover and accounts receivables turnover.</p>

<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara122">The calculation of inventory turnover shows how many times a company’s inventory is sold and replaced over the course of a period. The “average inventory” part of the equation is the average Inventory balance over the period, calculated as follows:</p>

<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara123">Inventory period shows how long, on average, inventory is on hand before it is sold.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara124">A higher inventory turnover (and thus, a lower inventory period) shows that the company’s inventory is selling quickly and is indicative that management is doing a good job of stocking products that are in demand.</p>
<p id="p89" class="calibre2">A company’s receivables turnover (calculated as credit sales over a period divided by average Accounts Receivable over the period) shows how quickly the company is collecting upon its Accounts Receivable.</p>

<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara125">Average collection period is exactly what it sounds like: the average length of time that a receivable from a customer is outstanding prior to collection.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara126">Obviously, higher receivables turnover and lower average collection period is generally the goal. If a company’s average collection period steadily increases from one year to the next, it could be an indication that the company needs to address its policies in terms of when and to whom it extends credit when making a sale.</p>

<ul id="ul13" class="calibre17">
<li id="li46" class="calibre11">Liquidity ratios show how easily a company will be able to meet its short-term financial obligations. The two most frequently used liquidity ratios are current ratio and quick ratio.</li>
<li id="li47" class="calibre11">Profitability ratios seek to analyze how profitable a company is in relation to its size. Return on assets and return on equity are the most important profitability ratios.</li>
<li id="li48" class="calibre11">Financial leverage ratios express to what extent a company is using debt (instead of shareholder investment) to finance its operations.</li>
<li id="li49" class="calibre11">The more leveraged a company is, the higher return on equity it will be able to provide its shareholders. However, increasing debt financing can dramatically increase the business’s risk level.</li>
