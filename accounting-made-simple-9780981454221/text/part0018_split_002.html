</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p125">Under the cash method of accounting, sales are recorded when cash is received, and expenses are recorded when cash is sent out. It’s straightforward and intuitive. The problem with the cash method, however, is that it doesn’t always reflect the economic reality of a situation.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line42"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p126"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE: </b> Pam runs a retail ice cream store. Her lease requires her to prepay her rent for the next three months at the beginning of every quarter. For example, in April, she is required to pay her rent for April, May, and June.
</p>
<p id="p127" class="calibre2">If Pam uses the cash method of accounting, her net income in April will be substantially lower than her net income in May or June, even if her sales and other expenses are exactly the same from month to month. If a potential creditor was to look at her financial statements on a monthly basis, the lender would get the impression that Pam’s profitability is subject to wild fluctuations. This is, of course, a distortion of the reality.</p>
