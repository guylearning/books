<p class="firstpara1" id="p163">Under GAAP, assets are generally recorded at their historical cost (i.e., the amount paid for them). This seems obvious, but there are times in which it would appear reasonable for a company to report an asset at a value other than the amount paid for it. For example, if a company has owned a piece of real estate for several decades, reporting the piece of land at its historical cost may very significantly understate the value of the land.</p>
<p id="p164" class="calibre2">However, if GAAP allowed companies to use any other valuation method—current market value for instance—it would introduce a great deal of subjectivity into the process. (To use the example of real estate again: Depending upon what method you use or who you ask, you could find several different answers for the fair market value of a piece of real estate.) Instead, GAAP usually requires that companies report assets using the most objective value: the cost paid for them.</p>
