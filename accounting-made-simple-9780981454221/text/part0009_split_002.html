<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara85">One concept that can trip up accounting novices is the idea that a liability for one person is, in fact, an asset for somebody else. For example, if you take out a loan with your bank, the loan is clearly a liability for you. From the perspective of your bank, however, the loan is an asset.</p>
<p id="p54" class="calibre2">Similarly, the balance in your savings or checking account is, of course, an asset (to you). For the bank, however, the balance is a liability. It’s money that they owe you, as you’re allowed to demand full or partial payment of it at any time.</p>

<li id="li10" class="calibre11">A company’s assets consist of all the property that the company owns. </li>
<li id="li11" class="calibre11">A company’s liabilities consist of all the debt that the company owes to lenders. </li>
<li id="li12" class="calibre11">A company’s owners’ equity is equal to the owners’ interest in the company’s assets, after paying back all the company’s debts. </li>
<li id="li13" class="calibre11">The accounting equation is always written as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p id="indent-para3" class="calibre2">Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity </p>
<ul id="ul4" class="calibre18">
<li id="li14" class="calibre11">However, it’s likely easier to think of the accounting equation this way:</li>
</ul>
<p id="p55" class="calibre2">Assets – Liabilities = Owners’ Equity.</p>
