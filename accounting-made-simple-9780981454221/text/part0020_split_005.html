</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p170">For GAAP purposes, it’s assumed that a company is an entirely separate entity from its owners. This concept is known as the “entity assumption” or “entity concept.”</p>
<p id="p171" class="calibre2">One important ramification of the entity assumption is the requirement for documenting transactions between a company and its owners. For example, if you wholly own a business, any transfers from the business’s bank account to your bank account need to be recorded, despite the fact that it doesn’t exactly seem like a “transaction” in that you’re really just moving around your own money.</p>
