<p class="firstpara1" id="firstpara70">Some professors like to say that accounting is “the language of business.” That definition has always been somewhat too abstract for my tastes. That said, all those professors are right.</p>
<p id="p51" class="calibre2">At its most fundamental level, accounting is the system of tracking the income, expenses, assets, and debts of a business. When looked at with a trained eye, a business’s accounting records truly tell the story of the business. Using nothing but a business’s “books” (accounting records), you can learn practically anything about a business. You can learn simple things such as whether it’s growing or declining, healthy or in trouble. Or, if you look closely, you can see things such as potential threats to the business’s health that might not be apparent even to people within the company.</p>
