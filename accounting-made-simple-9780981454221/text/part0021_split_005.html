</h2>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p191">In addition to straight-line, there are a handful of other (more complicated) methods of depreciation that are also GAAP-approved. For example, the double declining balance method consists of multiplying the remaining net book value by a given percentage every year. The percentage used is equal to double the percentage that would be used in the first year of straight-line depreciation.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line59"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p192"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> Randy purchases $10,000 of equipment, which he plans to depreciate over five years. Using straight-line, Randy would be depreciating 20% of the value (100% ÷ five years) in the first year. Therefore, the double declining balance method will use 40% depreciation every year (2 x 20%). The depreciation for each of the first four years would be as follows:

</div>
</div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p193"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE (CONTINUED):</b> Because the equipment is being depreciated over five years, Randy would record $1,296 (that is, 2,160 – 864) of depreciation expense in the fifth year in order to reduce the asset’s net book value to zero.
</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line60"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p194">Another GAAP-accepted method of depreciation is the units of production method. Under the units of production method, the rate at which an asset is depreciated is not a function of time, but rather a function of how much the asset is used.</p>
<div class="paras-leading-line" id="leading-line61"></div>
<p class="firstpara1" id="p195"><b class="calibre6">EXAMPLE:</b> Bruce runs a business making leather jackets. He spends $50,000 on a piece of equipment that is expected to last through the production of 5,000 jackets. Using the units of production method of depreciation, Bruce would depreciate the equipment each period based upon how many jackets were produced (at a rate of $10 depreciation per jacket).
</p>
<p id="p196" class="calibre2">If, in a given month, Bruce’s business used the equipment to produce 150 jackets, the following entry would be used to record depreciation:</p>
