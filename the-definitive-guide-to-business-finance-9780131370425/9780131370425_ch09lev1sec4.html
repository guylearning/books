			<p class="docText">The foregoing discussion about patterns touched on cause and effect. During your analysis of special one-off influences, you probably hit on some relationships that you can use to good effect in the future. Try to find rules of thumb, preferably with timing built-in, such as ‘a 10% increase in advertising in month one leads to a 2% increase in sales spread over months two and three’, or ‘a 5% cut in prices boosts sales by 10%’.</p>
			<a id="ch09note06"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">Turning points</p>
				<p class="docText">You often have to make bold assumptions and guesses in order to arrive at workable rules of thumb. Sometimes, knowing about the turning points is almost as useful. If interest rates stop falling and start rising, or the dollar takes a dive, it might signify that you should run for an umbrella.</p>

			<p class="docText">In addition, when you reviewed the cycle, you possibly found that events in the economy as a whole fed through to your bottom line in some predictable manner. With a bit of careful thought, you might identify all manner of relationships between your sales and published figures. Again, try to quantify the relationships in terms such as ‘a 1% rise in consumer expenditure leads to a 5% increase in our sales commencing four quarters later’.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0ENQBG" class="docSection2Title">Measuring relationships</h4>
				<p class="docText">If you have enough data, is it relatively easy to test these rule-of-thumb relationships and quantify their effectiveness. When we fitted a trend line we were looking for a relationship between sales and the passage of time. Spreadsheets also allow you to test the relationship between two or more time series. For example, suppose you manage a construction company and you notice that when interest rates fall your sales start to rise a few months later. Let me show you how to quantify this relationship and interpret the results.</p>
