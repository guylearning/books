			<p class="docText">The previous chapter described pattern-hunting in some depth. If this is your first stop in this book it would be better to go back and review <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a> before reading on. We will wait for you.</p>
			<p class="docText">As always when reviewing numbers, do not forget the big picture. The patterns in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch10lev1sec3.html#ch10fig01">Fig. 10.1</a> were very obvious, but you should always ask whether you are seeing the tip of the iceberg. The trend for the Expanding Company might be very different when viewed over 10 years (see <a class="docLink" href="#ch10fig02">Fig. 10.2</a>).</p>

			<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1592"></a><a id="iddle1787"></a>Clearly, the longer the run of historical data you can examine, the more of the iceberg you will see. This helps you put things in context. Of course, what happened five years ago might be largely irrelevant now, but even knowing this will help you make a better forecast.</p>

				</td><td valign="top"><h2 class="docSidebarTitle">What if there is no history?</h2><p class="docText">Do not worry if you are forecasting for a new business or a new product or service without an apparent history. There is always somewhere to look for helpful patterns. Unless this is your first assignment, you will probably be able to dredge up an example from your past business experience. Moreover, your company may have broadly similar business areas or product histories which yield much information. If all else fails, you may be able to tell much by analysing your competitors’ sales. But then you are doing that already. Right?</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EOZBG" class="docSection2Title">Projecting patterns</h4>
				<p class="docText">Recall that we split the sales figures into one-offs, the trend, the cycle, seasonality, and noise. Forecasting with a ruler would assume no special one-offs and no noise in the year ahead, extend mechanically the other patterns, and then glue them all together. For a better-educated forecast you would apply your knowledge and understanding of the environment to the trend, cycle and one-offs before extending them.</p>
				<a id="ch10note03"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">The kick-off meeting</p>
					<p class="docText">For forecasting involving teamwork, hold a kick-off meeting at which the underlying economic assumptions and corporate plans are specified or agreed.</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">As already mentioned, you may not be able to split the trend and the cycle – so you might treat them as one component. Seasonality is assumed to be a given. If you are tempted to amend the seasonal adjustment factors this means that either you are not comfortable with your assessment of them in the first place, or you are putting a one-off influence in the wrong place. We will return to patterns in a moment.</p>
