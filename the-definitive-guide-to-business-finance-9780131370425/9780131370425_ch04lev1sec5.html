			<p class="docText">A spreadsheet is to numbers what Word is to text or Outlook is to email. Essentially, spreadsheets just provide a framework or grid to help with the layout of their content, and a range of formatting and calculating options. The grid carves up the electronic page into boxes – or cells – which fall into neat rows and columns.</p>
			<p class="docText">What is the content of spreadsheets? It is simply words and figures that you want to lay out neatly in rows and columns (for an example, flick ahead to <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch04lev1sec9.html#ch04fig03">Fig. 4.3</a>). The real magic starts as soon as you want to do any summarizing (e.g. adding numbers in a column) or analysing (such as calculating ratios). Once you have told the spreadsheet what you want, you have the framework for ever more. You can change one number and the calculations will update automatically.</p>
			<p class="docText">Two other features are of huge significance. First, you can produce a chart (see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch05lev1sec3.html#ch05fig01">Fig. 5.1</a>) faster than a rat descending a greased drainpipe. Second, you can insert such pictures, or for that matter any other extract from a spreadsheet, into a Word document. Reports will never be the same again.</p>

				</td><td valign="top"><p class="docText">In the brief history of the PC, there have been only two or three dominant spreadsheet applications. Worthy of mention is the first-ever spreadsheet, VisiCalc, released on the Apple II (Mac) in the early 1980s. It was quickly swallowed up by the revolutionary Lotus 1-2-3 (now known as 123) which first hit the market in 1983. For most of the 1980s, 123 battled it out with upstart rivals such as SuperCalc and Quattro Pro. Microsoft introduced Excel in 1985; but, remarkably, for the Mac only. By the late 1980s Excel had been ported to the business-minded PC, and within a few years Excel was the undisputed winner. It remains so a decade later.</p><p class="docText">Despite this supremacy from Seattle, there is something of a choice today. The Lotus (office) SmartSuite in which 123 lives on, and Sun Microsystems’ Star Office are both significantly cheaper than Microsoft Office (which includes Excel). See also <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>, a free offshoot of Star Office. These rival products include spreadsheets which their developers claim are fully compatible with the Microsoft package.</p><p class="docText">The spreadsheet examples in this book are based on Excel because it is on more than three-quarters of all corporate desktops. You can do all the tricks demonstrated here using its rivals. Moreover, given that this book is about managing numbers, I should exhort you to consider using one of the lower-cost competitors. You could be a hero for cutting your company’s software licensing costs significantly. (And, by the way, Microsoft did not bother to reply when I asked for permission to use Excel screenshots in this book; the Corporation’s standard terms for doing so are legalistically unhelpful.)</p></td></tr></table></div><br/>
