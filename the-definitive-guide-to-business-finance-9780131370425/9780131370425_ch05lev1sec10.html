			<p class="docText">This chapter has looked at a collection of techniques which help with examining and reporting. Some of them, such as charts, rounding and summarizing, are used throughout this book and, no doubt, your work. The normal distribution is relevant to risk assessment which we review in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch23.html#ch23">Chapter 23</a>. Weighting and index numbers are all around us – in stock market indices, some exchange rate indicators, many economic series such as inflation, and industrial production, and – notably – the financial analysis which is the main topic of this book.</p>
			<p class="docText">Moreover, in the next chapter we will build on what we have just covered, by moving on to consider the arithmetic of investment and finance. This has wide ranging applications and will, as you will see, help you make better management decisions.</p>
