			<p class="docText">A moment ago we touched on growth rates. Inflation – a general increase in prices – is simply a manifestation, albeit usually unwanted, of growth. Accordingly, the same arithmetic applies. For example, if inflation is 5% a year for three years, the overall increase in prices is 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.05 or 15.8%.</p>
			<p class="docText">Inflation erodes the value of money. Unadjusted prices – the amounts that you and I pay in the shops – are known as current prices. Prices adjusted to remove the effects of inflation are known as real or constant prices. For example, if inflation is running at 5% per annum and a company raises its prices by 7%, the real increase is 7 − 5 = 2%.</p>
			<p class="docText">Governments produce various indices of prices – the retail price index, consumer price index, wholesale price indices, and various GDP deflators – which, as discussed in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch18.html#ch18">Chapter 18</a>, can be used to convert any price trends into constant prices. The table on p. <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch18lev1sec3.html#ch18sb03">274</a> shows how you can divide through by a price index to create a constant price index.</p>
