If you are not planning to use cause and effect to forecast your sales, and even if you are, you need to review all the information you can collect about your sales environment and apply your judgement to projecting the trend. When reviewing the environment, it is logical to start with the big picture and work inwards towards your own office.</p>

					<p class="docText">The broad economic outlook is so important that the prospects are usually agreed at the corporate level before any round of forecasting and budgeting begins. This ensures that assumptions about the economy are acceptable to senior executives, and consistent across the enterprise.</p>
					<p class="docText">Rather than making their own forecasts, organizations frequently rely on the opinions of the so-called experts. Their forecasts become your assumptions. There are many government, quasi-government, academic and private-sector bodies which publish economic forecasts. These are reported on the Internet and in higher-quality newspapers, sometimes with tabular presentations providing handy comparisons of several projections. If you are making the decisions or are tasked with setting the assumptions, you can use one of these forecasts, or a judgemental average of them. There are links to forecasts and economic figures on this book’s website.</p>

					<p class="docText">If you are on top of your business you will already have a good understanding about the outlook for your industry. This may have been supplemented by your hard thinking about the economy. You might also want to revisit specialist industry-related journals for specific views on the prospects. You can clip useful articles and put them on file to support your forecast.</p>
					<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1596"></a><a id="iddle1758"></a>Obviously, you will review your competitors’ strategies. Remember to include companies which are not currently in your industry, or not even in your market – yet. They might be next year. Look for surveys of buying intentions, or conduct your own market research. Again, remember that your sales could be affected by changes in demand for a product which does not appear to compete directly with yours.</p>
					<a id="ch10note05"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">Expert witness</p>
						<p class="docText">Talk to trade associations, marketing consultants, distributors, re-sellers, suppliers and other business partners. What they are doing, and what they know about the market, can be a very useful input.</p>

				<p class="docText">Your forecasts also depend on your own corporate plans (production, product pricing, investment, etc.). Indeed, pricing policies are usually critical factors in forecasts. To some extent, the plans depend on the outcome of the forecasts. Accordingly, it may be necessary to conduct a round of planning and forecasting, review the results, make the tough decisions, and then repeat the forecasting on the basis of the revised plans.</p>

					</td><td valign="top"><h2 class="docSidebarTitle">How other companies forecast sales</h2><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">From the ground up – by looking and asking.</span> Sales professionals usually have a very close handle on their market, and order books can give a very clear indication of future business especially for products with long order-times such as building construction projects, aircraft and some software.</p><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">The numbers game – an arithmetical approach.</span> So many cold calls will generate so-many leads that will result in so many sales. When you know how many of each your sales people can process, and the size of your sales force, the rest is simple arithmetic. There is an example in <a class="docLink" href="#ch10fig03">Fig. 10.3</a>.</p><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Try harder – last year plus 10%.</span> It is frequently tempting to forecast and set targets on the basis of last year’s sales plus 10% or some other percentage. This can be very appealing, not least because it is based on what you know you can do, while at the same time stretching the organization. Remember though, that it is not very feasible to expect such exponential growth to continue indefinitely (see diagram in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, Why growth matters, on p. <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch06lev1sec3.html#ch06lev4sec1">80</a>).</p><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Whatever you can manage – market share.</span> An alternative to ‘last year plus 10%’ is to aim for ‘x% of the market’. Your market share, of course, is your sales of, say, widgets as a percentage of total sales of widgets in a specific market during a given time period. Ideally you want this to be increasing over time. It is usually hard to measure, unless there are reliable industry-wide figures published without too much of a lag. Executives managing new products or new businesses frequently resort to market share for their forecasts (‘if we capture 1% of the market our sales will be ...’).</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>
