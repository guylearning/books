			<p class="docText">One common problem area seems to be managing expenditure by employees. The matter comes under control relatively easily with proper procedures in place. Essentially, for each member of staff, decide whether they should have discretionary power to spend money on the company’s behalf. If so, allocate limits on the amount of expenditure that they can authorize for each category of outlays. For example, a supervisor might have authority to spend up to $50 a month on stationery. A junior manager might be permitted to approve overtime within a certain ceiling. A senior manager may have power to undertake capital spending. And so on. Corporations often do this by department and job grade, although, as with any rules, it may be necessary to make sensible exceptions. The limits should preferably apply so long as overall spending is with certain pre-approved budgetary limits. This is discussed in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch22.html#ch22">Chapter 22</a>.</p>

Individuals travelling on business are usually required to track spending, maybe convert it into the home currency, and list it by category and date to show that each day’s spending in each category is within their authority. With the added complications of dealing with jet lag, tight and changing schedules, alien cultures, and spending on incidentals for which no receipt is issued, the traveller often loses track of all company outlays. Hands up all managers who have paid legitimate business expenses out of their own pockets and forgotten to claim it back.</p>
			<p class="docText">For the traveller, the solution is to exercise self-discipline and write up notes at the end of each day. When abroad with a notebook computer or handheld organizer, the obvious trick is to maintain a spreadsheet with an extra couple of columns which facilitate currency conversions. Failing this, you may be able to visit an Internet café and keep notes on a password-protected area of a website – or send them to yourself by email. For the company, it may make sense to pay <span class="docEmphasis">per diems</span> – specific daily cash allowances, no questions asked, which dispense with the need for detailed expenses claims and sheaves of receipts. Either way, and especially for corporate entertainment, employees should at least be asked to sign an undertaking confirming that the spending was not lavish, was on company business and was in relation to an identified sale, client or project.</p>
