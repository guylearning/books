			<p class="docText">If you sneak into the office of a financial whiz, you will find only one real tool – a PC with spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel. PCs used by real beanies will also contain an electronic accounting package, which we will discuss in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>. If you look really hard, you will find some other software to help with obscure calculations. Beyond this, everything else is obsolete or obsolescent. Calculators, adding machines and look-up tables are still used sometimes, but the humble spreadsheet fulfils their roles and does much more. Even reference books containing hard-to-remember formulas are unnecessary, because spreadsheet software generously provides the formulas in built-in crib sheets.</p>
			<p class="docText">However, if you think that spreadsheets are the exclusive preserve of propeller heads and beanies, think again. Spreadsheets can help every manager manage better. Even if you are coming in cold, I guarantee that within an hour of working through this chapter you will have thought of a way to use a spreadsheet to improve at least one of your tasks (connect to this book’s website and tell me what it was). You can probably see where we are heading. It is time to get under the covers with a spreadsheet.</p>

This has become the undisputed tool for business use. You will also come across the Mac, which evolved from Apple’s machine of the same era as the IBM PC. The Mac has become the tool of choice for some creative types, while left-brain financial wizards use PCs almost without exception. Most software mentioned in this book runs on PCs and Macs, so I will use the term PC as synonymous with Mac. Apologies to staunch aficionados of either who object to this.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>
