			<p class="docText">With the previous thoughts out of the way, let me get back to the story. My first job was in a bank, operating monstrous adding machines (I also made the tea and fed the canary). I totalled, in the constructive sense, anything that did not move, and some things that did: cheques, share certificates, piles of money.</p>
			<p class="docText">I learned two lessons. First, do everything in two different ways. If the totals disagree, you have made a mistake. Second, if the error is divisible by nine, it is odds on that you have reversed two digits. For example, if you enter 54 instead of 45, the total will be out by 9 exactly. Try swapping two digits in any number and checking by how much it increases or decreases. The difference is always a multiple of nine. For me, this discovery was the beginning of a life-long fascination with numbers.</p>
			<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1275"></a><a id="iddle1432"></a>But I digress. The point I really wanted to make was about adding machines or <span class="docEmphasis">comptometers</span>. These were noisy mechanical monsters with arrays of over 100 buttons. Originally, driven by obstinate crank handles, they were later powered by whirring motors in much the same way as old electric typewriters. They were too heavy to move around easily. Indeed, accountants would send their adding up to a room full of nimble-fingered machine operators and wait anxiously for the results. The alternatives were mental arithmetic, slide rules and books of look-up tables. A lucky few in the latter days before PCs could send a box of punch cards to the electronic data processing (EDP) department, as information technology (IT) was then known, and wait even longer for results â€“ which were invariably useless because the cards were punched wrongly or somebody had dropped them and mixed up the order.</p>
			<p class="docText">Electronic calculators that rendered all this obsolete hit the market in 1972. True, at first, their capabilities were limited, but their impact cannot be underestimated. They were, however, overshadowed within a mere decade by innovations with even greater significance: desktop computers and spreadsheet programs.</p>
			<p class="docText">Imagine how difficult it was to prepare forecasts in the days before personal computers. By and large, financials had to be fairly rudimentary. Today, common office software has matured to the extent that a non-financial manager can do tricks with numbers that were previously undreamed of even by mathematical specialists. We will discuss some of this wizardry in this chapter and develop the ideas as we work through the book together.</p>
