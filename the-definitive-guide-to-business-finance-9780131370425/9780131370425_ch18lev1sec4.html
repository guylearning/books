			<p class="docText">As promised, it is time now to run through some key ratios and other relationships. Others are discussed in the next chapter. As you read the following paragraphs, remember the warnings about the problems with comparing competitors.</p>
			<a id="ch18lev2sec6"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EQDCI" class="docSection2Title">Liquidity</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1030"></a><a id="iddle1122"></a><a id="iddle1357"></a><a id="iddle1735"></a><a id="iddle1736"></a><a id="iddle1829"></a><a id="iddle1926"></a><a id="iddle2209"></a>You will be well aware by now that profit does not equate directly to cash in the bank. There are no better measures of liquidity than detailed cash flow projections. Unfortunately, these are not going to be made available in the published statements of your competitors and other companies of interest. As an alternative, liquidity ratios can be used as an, albeit <span class="docEmphasis">historical</span>, indication whether the business is likely to be able to meet its <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_222">future</a></i> financial obligations as they fall due.</p>

					<h5 id="title-ID0EWFCI" class="docSection3Title">Working capital</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="docText">Current assets <span class="docEmphasis">less</span> current liabilities</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="docText">The net of total assets and liabilities is known as working capital and is used as a proxy for cash requirements. Obviously, too much working capital implies wasted resources which claw down the return on capital. On the other hand, a company will have a painful cash flow crisis if short-term liabilities, such as trade credit and salaries, rents, etc. cannot be met. The expectation is that these costs will be met from short-term assets, primarily bank deposits, sales of inventory and receipts from trade debtors. The flaw in this argument is that even though assets may be classified as short term, some, such as refundable deposits and work-in-progress, cannot be converted into cash with ease. Moreover, the picture is distorted by inventory valuations (see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</a>). The acid test eliminates some of these difficulties.</p>
					<a id="ch18note03"></a><div class="docNote"><table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td valign="top" style="width: 60px;">

						</td><td valign="top"><p class="docText">A company is said to be <span class="docEmphasis">overtrading</span> if it is operating with too little working capital. In this situation, accounts payable accumulate and ultimately the company may be forced to restructure or default (see <span class="docEmphasis">Debt restructuring</span> in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>).</p></td></tr></table></div><br/>
				
				<a id="ch18lev3sec13"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EOHCI" class="docSection3Title">Current ratio</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="docText">Current assets <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> current liabilities</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="docText">The current ratio provides a guide for interpreting whether working capital is adequate. If it is less than 1, current liabilities exceed current assets. It looks as if the business cannot meet its daily commitments. A figure of 2 used to be a safe rule of thumb (current assets are twice current liabilities) but 1.5 is often acceptable.</p>
				
				<a id="ch18lev3sec14"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EBICI" class="docSection3Title">Acid test (quick ratio, liquid ratio)</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="docText">(Current assets <span class="docEmphasis">less</span> stocks) <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> current liabilities</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="docText"><a id="under"></a>As discussed under <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_466">working capital</a></i>, inventory can be difficult to turn into cash, and interpretation is clouded by variations in inventory valuation methods. These issues are disposed of by the acid test, which eliminates inventory from the calculation. As a result, cross-company comparisons are also more valid. A ratio of 1 is a useful rule of thumb – but businesses that buy on credit and sell for cash (e.g. food retailing) may have acid test ratios as low as 0.2. This shows how careful you have to be when interpreting ratios.</p>

					<h5 id="title-ID0E5ICI" class="docSection3Title">Defensive interval (no-credit survival interval)</h5>
					<a id="ch18sb04"></a><table cellspacing="0" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><td>
						<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1089"></a><a id="iddle1123"></a><a id="iddle1387"></a><a id="iddle1754"></a><a id="iddle1789"></a><a id="iddle1813"></a><a id="iddle1895"></a><a id="iddle1902"></a><a id="iddle1970"></a><a id="iddle2168"></a><a id="iddle2210"></a>(Production and operating costs excluding depreciation) <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> cash and equivalents <span class="docEmphasis">times</span> 365</p>
					</td></tr></table><br/>
					<p class="docText">This reveals the number of days a company could survive by living off cash in the bank. It is roughly the same thing as asking how long you could survive without income. However, it does exclude accounts receivable, inventory and other assets which, one would suppose, might be liquidated during a crisis.</p>
				
			
			<a id="ch18lev2sec7"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EIMCI" class="docSection2Title">Profitability and operating efficiency</h4>
				<p class="docText">There is no need for me to tell you that profitability and efficiency are closely watched, although remember that maximizing profits might not be a critical short-run objective.</p>
				<a id="ch18lev3sec16"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0ESMCI" class="docSection3Title">Profit margin</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="docText">Operating profit (before tax, interest, etc.) <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> sales</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="docText">This indicates the profit per dollar of sales. A low figure is not necessarily bad – for supermarkets it can fall to 1% – check against inventory and receivables turnover, asset value, gross profit margins, etc and the industry average. A figure below the industry average might indicate low prices and/or high costs. A high figure might attract competitors.</p>
				
				<a id="ch18lev3sec17"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EFNCI" class="docSection3Title">Return on capital employed</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="docText">Operating profit (before interest and tax) <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> (total assets <span class="docEmphasis">less</span> current liabilities)</p>
					</blockquote>
				
				<a id="ch18lev3sec18"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EYNCI" class="docSection3Title">Return on total assets</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="docText">Operating profit (before interest and tax) <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> total assets</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="docText">These returns are clearly important as a measure of the company’s operating efficiency. A low return on assets or capital employed (very similar, given the relationship between balance sheet entries) suggests a candidate for disposal – or bankruptcy in the next economic downturn. If the return is below the cost of loans, additional borrowing will <span class="docEmphasis">reduce</span> earnings per share. This measure provides a good yardstick for assessing new ventures – if their return is below it, it will be clawed down.</p>
				
				<a id="ch18lev3sec19"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EOOCI" class="docSection3Title">Turnover of (working) capital</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="docText">Sales <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> capital employed</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Turnover of working capital</span> measures sales per unit of capital. It shows how efficiently capital is being used to generate sales. A low ratio (sales are low relative to capital) tends to suggest that the capital is not being used profitably. At the other <a id="iddle1020"></a><a id="iddle1025"></a><a id="iddle1347"></a><a id="iddle1377"></a><a id="iddle1691"></a><a id="iddle1830"></a><a id="iddle1841"></a><a id="iddle1934"></a><a id="iddle2101"></a><a id="iddle2129"></a><a id="iddle2131"></a>extreme, a very high ratio of sales to working capital warns of <span class="docEmphasis">overtrading</span> – inadequate working capital which could put creditors at risk. Watch also that a growing ratio might indicate that plant and machinery is not being kept up to date (depreciation is reducing the capital base and making the ratio look better).</p>
				
				<a id="ch18lev3sec20"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EKRCI" class="docSection3Title">Receivables turnover (trade debtors to sales)</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="docText">Accounts receivable <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> sales</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="docText">This shows credit allowed to customers – or, to put it another way – the speed at which debts are collected. If payment is collected by the end of the month following delivery, receivables will run at about 12% of sales. (Multiply the ratio by 365 to find the average number of days it takes to collect debts (based, remember, on one balance sheet date).) A high figure might indicate sloppy financial control. A reduction might suggest better control – or a desperate need for cash. Factoring (selling) debts also reduces the figure. Note by the way, the small inconsistency introduced because receivables includes sales tax or value added tax, while sales do not (see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>).</p>
				
				<a id="ch18lev3sec21"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EESCI" class="docSection3Title">Payables turnover (trade creditors to sales)</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="docText">Accounts payable <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> sales</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="docText">This indicates the amount of trade credit that a company is allowed by its suppliers. Watch trends over time – an increase might indicate a rise in trade credit necessitated by cash flow problems. Other measures used include:</p>
					<ul><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Receivables to inventory</span> – which shows what proportion of stocks is financed by suppliers (exceeds 100% in food retailing).</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Debtors to receivables</span> – where sudden big changes can also give early warning of cash-flow pressures.</p></li></ul>
				
				<a id="ch18lev3sec22"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EITCI" class="docSection3Title">Inventory/stock turnover</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="docText">Cost of sales <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> average inventory (half the sum of opening <span class="docEmphasis">plus</span> closing stock)</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="docText">This shows how fast inventory is moving through the business. A high turnover indicates healthy, saleable and liquid inventory with lower demands on cash flow (or maybe there are stock shortages!). A low average turnover suggests overstocking and dated merchandise (or stockpiling to meet seasonal demand). Calculating the average from only two days a period is highly dangerous if those are not representative days. I am sure that companies would not manage their inventory levels on those dates to influence this ratio.</p>
