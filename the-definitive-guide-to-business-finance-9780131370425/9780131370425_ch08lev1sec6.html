			<p class="docText">Not being able to pay the bills is a common killer. As we will discuss, it is possible to be making a profit and suffering a cash flow crisis at the same time. Accordingly, it is always important to try to bring in payments from customers as soon as possible after issuing invoices. For large credit sales, you may want to consult a credit agency before finalizing the sale, to see if the customer has a record of bad debts. You might also take an advance payment which covers a large part of your costs, so that you are risking mainly your profit. Offering discounts for early payment can be a strong incentive for clients to part with their cash, as discussed in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>. Charging interest on overdue accounts also helps bring tardy clients into line – but make sure that you charge interest in arrears or you might actually stall payment for an extra month. Beyond this, manage customer relations carefully and follow up promptly on <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_328">past due</a></i> accounts.</p>
			<p class="docText">At regular intervals, say once a month, examine all outstanding accounts to see how overdue they are. The layout of the report you want to consider should look similar to the following <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_023">aging report</a></i>, except that there will be at least one line for each customer. Obviously, particular warning signs are clients with more than one past due account, and accounts which are very old. Also, keep your eye on accounts which are overdue because of undelivered goods, warranty claims, and disputes – they often give you warning signs about your own people.</p>

				<p class="docText">No matter how careful you are in selecting clients and managing relationships, some debts always go bad. This is such a common problem that accounting for it is built into the beanie culture. Long before debts are finally <span class="docEmphasis">written off</span>, you will recognize that some may not be collectible. For example, if you conclude that that the $10,000 that is more than 90 days past due may never be paid, you would pass a bookkeeping entry as follows:</p>
				<a id="ch08table04"></a><table cellspacing="0" class="allBorders" border="1"><caption><span class="docTableTitle"> Bookkeeping transaction – allowance for bad debts, 31 Dec</span></caption><colgroup align="left" span="4"><col width="100"/><col width="200"/><col width="150"/><col width="100"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top"><span class="docEmphStrong">Account no.</span></td><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top"><span class="docEmphStrong">Account</span></td><td class="docTableCell" align="center" valign="top"><span class="docEmphStrong">Debit $</span></td><td class="docTableCell" align="center" valign="top"><span class="docEmphStrong">Credit $</span></td></tr><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">9–5045</td><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">Bad debts (Expense account)</td><td class="docTableCell" align="center" valign="top">10,000.00</td><td class="docTableCell" align="center" valign="top">–</td></tr><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">1–1015</td><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">Accounts receivables contra</td><td class="docTableCell" align="center" valign="top">–</td><td class="docTableCell" align="center" valign="top">10,000.00</td></tr></tbody></table><br/>
				<p class="docText">This has charged $10,000 against income, reducing net profit by $10,000. It has also credited an asset account <span class="docEmphasis">allowance for bad debts</span>. Recall that asset accounts usually have debit balance. The <span class="docEmphasis">allowance</span> is a <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_100">contra account</a></i>, meaning that it has the opposite balance to what you would normally expect. As a result, your net total of accounts receivable may be as follows:</p>
				<table cellspacing="0" class="allBorders" border="1" rules="none" cellpadding="5"><colgroup align="left" span="2"><col width="250"/><col width="100"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">Accounts receivable</td><td class="docTableCell" align="right" valign="top">$150,000</td></tr><tr><td class="docTableCell bottomBorder" align="left" valign="top">Less allowance for bad debts</td><td class="docTableCell bottomBorder" align="right" valign="top">10,000</td></tr><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">Net accounts receivable</td><td class="docTableCell" align="right" valign="top">140,000</td></tr></tbody></table><br/>
				<p class="docText">When you examine an aging report for the <span class="docEmphasis">n</span>th time and the same debt is still outstanding, you might finally make a management judgement that you should write it off. As painful as this is, you will have to credit <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_013">accounts receivable</a></i><a id="the"></a> and debit the <span class="docEmphasis">allowance for bad debts</span>, to wipe out the $10,000 asset. You do not have to charge an expense account because you did that when you recognized that the debt would probably not be paid.</p>
				<p class="docText">However, if you were lucky and the account was paid, you would reverse the bookkeeping entry shown above and then debit cash and credit accounts receivable as normal.</p>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1224"></a>Sometimes you can identify doubtful debts individually as described above. Once you have been in business for long enough, you will be able to say on the basis of past experience that, say, 2.5% of sales will turn into bad debts, or 1% of 1–30 days past due and 1.5% of receivables that are more than 30 days overdue. If you do not have a sufficient track record, you could examine the accounts of similar businesses (see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch17.html#ch17">Chapter 17</a>) and estimate a percentage based on their experience. Your goal, of course, is to reduce the percentage as much as possible with effective credit management.</p>
