			<p class="docText">So, you need a sales forecast. How do I know this? Easy. Cooking up a forecast of anything in a business context nearly always boils down to forecasting sales volumes (i.e. quantity rather than value). Once you have this central number, everything else will be estimated, not forecast.</p>
			<a id="ch10note01"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">The secret</p>
				<p class="docText">The secret of successful forecasting is to identify just one variable to forecast (usually sales) and estimate everything else based on that forecast.</p>
			</div><br/>
			<p class="docText">For example, when the board of directors asks for a forecast of net income or net profit for next year, they are really asking you to forecast sales and then fit everything else into place around this key number. In a nutshell, once you have arrived at a figure for sales volume, sales values (the cash that changes hands) are a matter of simple arithmetic based on your pricing policies. Moreover, once you have predicted what contracts you will sign or how many units you will sell, you can work out the resources that are needed to make it happen – how many people, how many machines, how much raw material, and so on. You can put a price on these, subtract the total from sales value and there’s the bottom line.</p>
			<p class="docText">It is important to note the subtle difference between a forecast and an estimate. Frankly, forecasting requires a large measure of educated guesswork. Estimation requires only logic and simple arithmetic. The way this works will become clear shortly. When you have identified the one item that you need to forecast, you have cut away most of the guesswork and grey areas and structured your thinking. What is more, by linking all the other estimated numbers to the forecast, you can quickly see what would happen on a less – or more – optimistic scenario by amending the forecast and seeing how the changes ripple through the numbers. This chapter focuses on the forecasting; subsequent chapters cover estimating.</p>

If you are dealing with a non-profit enterprise, such as a charity, museum or cooperative society you might forecast donations, visitors, acquisitions, or the number of cases processed. For a government department, you might work with the number of applicants or permits. And so on. If you run a cost centre within an enterprise, you will base your numbers on the expected demand for your services or output (e.g. the number of research and development projects to be undertaken, or the quantity of desktop PCs to support). Usually, in such instances, the forecasting is done for you at the enterprise level and you have only to do the estimating.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EEXBG" class="docSection2Title">Wishes, targets or forecasts?</h4>
				<p class="docText">It is not at all uncommon for sales forecasts to become sales targets. A sales target is a key business objective and as such is often self-fulfilling. Your sales personnel will be working to meet their quota and, believe it or not, will often adjust their effort up or down to achieve the best result (for themselves mainly, which is not always the best result for the company). Accordingly, when you are forecasting you are frequently walking a tightrope, balancing what you have the capacity to sell or what you would like to sell against what you predict that market conditions will allow you to sell.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EYXBG" class="docSection2Title">Multiple sales forecasts</h4>
				<p class="docText">Incidentally, from an arithmetical viewpoint, you will be lucky if you are forecasting just one item. You may have hundreds or even thousands of products. So far we have talked about forecasting just one central item – sales. This is more or less correct. In fact, you may need to make several sales forecasts and combine them into a grand total.</p>

				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">You do not usually need to go down to the level of forecasting sales for each individual product – unless they are <span class="docEmphasis">big ticket</span> (i.e. high-priced) or otherwise unique. It makes sense to work with groups of items that are subject to similar influences. Indeed this can actually <a id="iddle1364"></a><a id="iddle1588"></a><a id="iddle1589"></a><a id="iddle1594"></a><a id="iddle1646"></a><a id="iddle1667"></a><a id="iddle1756"></a><a id="iddle1840"></a><a id="iddle2017"></a><a id="iddle2158"></a>help to average out forecasting inaccuracies and make your predictions more accurate overall.</p>
				<p class="docText">You can segment your sales forecasts according to types of product, category of buyer, geographic markets, and so on. For example, a computer outlet <span class="docEmphasis">might</span> forecast sales of business software, computer games, leisure software, and hardware as four separate categories. The key to successful segmentation is grouping together products and services which behave similarly under any given market conditions. This will become clear as you work through this chapter.</p>
