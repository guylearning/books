			<p class="docText">It is usually important, if not critical, to make one or more alternative forecasts to see what happens in a worst-case scenario (what if the economy enters recession? what if your competitors try to blow you out of the water?) and a best-case scenario (what if sales go through the roof?). At least having done the analysis and built the spreadsheet, there is not too much work involved in producing the alternative scenarios. The easiest way to do this is by making a duplicate of your spreadsheet and keying in some new numbers in the trend and/or one-off columns.</p>
			<p class="docText">Among statisticians and beanies, what-if analysis is known by the mystical name of sensitivity analysis. This makes more sense if you think of it in terms of: ‘what if interest rates rise by one percentage point?’, ‘what if sales demand rises by 1%?’ and so on. We shall return to this in later chapters.</p>

How often have you heard someone say too many sales is a problem we would like to have and we will deal with if it happens. Nevertheless, your investors, board or senior managers might be cheered up if they see a realistic best-case outlook (do not hype something you cannot deliver). More important, it helps you to see what you are capable of and where bottlenecks and capacity constraints can occur. When you know the critical levels, you can monitor sales and react accordingly if warnings are triggered.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>
