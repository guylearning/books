			<p class="docText">This chapter has looked at some crucial concepts in managing money. We will return to the bigger picture of cash management in the later chapters. For now, perhaps we are getting ahead of ourselves. In the next couple of chapters I want to look at how you forecast sales. Sales after all, are the key to cash flow. You will need to take off your beanie hat and fire up your spreadsheets again. Keep your feet planted in your management shoes, though, because you still need to apply judgement and common sense.</p>
