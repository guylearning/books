			<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1031"></a><a id="iddle1093"></a><a id="iddle1277"></a><a id="iddle1520"></a><a id="iddle1530"></a><a id="iddle1557"></a><a id="iddle1703"></a><a id="iddle1767"></a><a id="iddle2104"></a>Companies cooperate for many reasons. Joint ventures range from shared assets (e.g. oil pipelines), through jointly controlled operations (as with the Airbus consortium), to shared control of a third entity. Equity investments range from a few shares purchased to show commitment to a supplier or distributor, to outright acquisition in order to acquire control of assets or market share, or a merger which replaces two companies with one new enterprise. A company might also make loans to another, usually to promote some mutual interest. You can assess such opportunities using the techniques discussed elsewhere in this book, especially in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
			<p class="docText">Accounting for such mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures, varies significantly across jurisdictions, although, as you have guessed, there is a slow move towards convergence. The aim of regulators is to prevent manipulation of accounts. For example, under cost accounting rules, an investor might use its power to defer payment of dividends thereby avoiding reporting its share of the associate company’s net profit; while merger accounting rules have permitted true acquisition costs to be hidden.</p>
			<p class="docText">The following list is a rough and ready overview of international accounting standards. It defines the classification of business combinations and cooperation, and the applicable accounting policies. The list is arranged in order of priority and the first one of these to apply to a particular situation is the definition to be used:</p>
			<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Subsidiary</span> – company owns more than 50% of the equity of another. Financial statements should be <span class="docEmphStrong">consolidated</span>, showing combined totals for each category of assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses. Intra-group balances and transactions and resulting unrealized profits must be eliminated.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Joint venture</span> – a contractual arrangement, with jointly controlled operations, assets or entities (one partner may manage the venture, but neither/none has absolute control). Financial statements should show assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues arising from the joint venture (proportionally for shared assets); for jointly controlled entities, use proportionate consolidation or the equity (see next) method.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Associate</span> – company owns between 20% and 50% inclusive of another’s shares. Financial reporting should use the <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_179">equity method</a></b> (<span class="docEmphasis">one line consolidation</span>) where investments are shown initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for the investor’s share in the net assets of the associate; and the profit and loss account shows the investor’s share of the associate’s net profits.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_262">Investment</a></b> – company owns less than 20% of the shares. Reporting should use the <span class="docEmphStrong">cost method</span> where investments are shown as an asset at cost; and dividends are reported in the profit and loss account as investment income.</p></div></li></ol></div>
			<p class="docText">If you think this seems too straightforward, you are right. For example, merger accounting (used where no clear acquirer can be identified) was prohibited by the US and Canada in 2001. In 2004, amid charges of pandering to the US, the <a id="iddle1295"></a><a id="iddle1307"></a><a id="iddle1503"></a><a id="iddle2139"></a>International Accounting Standards Board (in IFRS 3) also outlawed merger accounting, requiring the following for business combinations:</p>
			<ul><li><p class="docList">Universal application of acquisition (purchase) accounting.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Intangible items to be recognized as assets separately from goodwill.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, to be measured initially at fair value.</p></li><li><p class="docList">No amortization of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives; instead they should be tested for impairment at least annually.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Negative goodwill to be written off immediately.</p></li></ul>

				</td><td valign="top"><p class="docText">Transactions between related entities provide scope for creative accounting. First, <span class="docEmphasis">transfer prices</span> can be set selectively. By selling goods, services, or intellectual property at a knock down price, profits are transferred to the buyer. Similarly, inflated expenses are sometimes charged to other entities in order to tranfer profits in the other direction. There are a number of possible objectives, including minimizing tax liabilities (with dubious legality) and supporting a subsidiary. Of course, tax authorities and accounting regulators demand realism in <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_439">transfer pricing</a></i>. In addition, companies frequently charge business units with a share of head office costs, turning the subsidiary entity into a cost centre for tax or other reasons.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/>
