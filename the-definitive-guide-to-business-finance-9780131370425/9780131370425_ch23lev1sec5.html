			<p class="docText">When you are fully staffed and fully stretched and your machinery is processing the largest volume of products possible, you are operating at 100% of capacity. You will know what this volume is from the analysis in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</a>. Remember, though, that as with fixed costs, capacity is only fixed until you change it – you could, for example, close down a production line, or open a new factory.</p>
			<p class="docText">Continuing with the previous example. Suppose you calculate that the largest number of widgets that you can turn over in a day is 100, due to limits on storage, packing, distribution, etc. (Capacity is not just about production.) You have just established that you break even at 20 widgets a day. Accordingly, break even is at a comfortably low 20% of capacity, as follows:</p>

It happens that this squares away nicely with your actual optimum capacity use. It should do, because I made up the figures. I knew that in this example, if production rises much against 80%, machinery wears out more rapidly, replacement, maintenance costs and overtime pay soar (these were in the break-even analysis) and tempers fray. If your profit-optimized capacity use is significantly out of line with your actual optimum capacity level, you need to revisit your production and operating plans.</p>
			<p class="docText">However, there is little point in setting up your organization to produce at the optimum level for the resources you can deploy, if your sales machinery or the market cannot keep up. Sales may never reach the profit-maximizing optimum of 80 units in this example, because there is not enough demand or because your competitors move into your lucrative market. Clearly, you need to pull all the factors at play into balance in your forecasting and planning.</p>
