			<p class="docText">I want to give you a little warning. The remainder of this chapter outlines the basics of spreadsheets. The easiest way to understand these incredible tools is to use one. Accordingly, I am going to assume that you have this book in one hand and a mouse in the other. If you are wondering why you need to hold a small, furry rodent you should skip the next few pages. If you know what I mean by mouse, but you do not have one to hand, you can skim the remainder of this chapter and return to it, say, during your lunch break at the office.</p>

				<p class="docText">A blank spreadsheet is potentially enormous. The bit of it you are using is a table. (I’m not sure my spreadsheet manual defines it this way, but it makes sense to me.)</p>
				<p class="docText">It helps to try to make to your tables fit neatly into one or more printed pages. With small print you can get 12 months’ budget figures, together with captions and totals in the width of A4 or letter paper.</p>
