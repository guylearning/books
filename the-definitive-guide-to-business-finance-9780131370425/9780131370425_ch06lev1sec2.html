			<p class="docText">This chapter is about the arithmetic of finance and investment. I hope this excites you. If instead it makes you feel nervous, let me reassure you. Talk of percentages, compound growth rates and discount rates might seem terrifying to some, but, if so, blame the educational system. These are actually simple concepts and they have the delight of being unarguable – back to one apple plus one apple is indubitably two apples. Moreover, the concepts presented here are the key to understanding investments. And who does not want to make one apple into ten apples or more.</p>
			<p class="docText">Actually, if there is one theme for this chapter it is <span class="docEmphasis">relationships</span> – such as the relationships between:</p>
			<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">proportions and percentages</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">growth and interest rates</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">interest rates and discount rates</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">interest rates, risk and time</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">the present and future value of money.</p></div></li></ol></div>
			<p class="docText">We shall examine each of these duos (OK, number 4 is a trio) and see how they relate to each other. They are all inextricably interwoven. Moreover, as you will have deduced by now, they are critical elements in decisions about money when time is involved. I nearly forgot to mention that we will see how to use our good friend the spreadsheet to do the calculations, so the arithmetic is not going to be too taxing.</p>
			<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1637"></a><a id="iddle1848"></a><a id="iddle1921"></a>The chapter concludes by looking at the practical applications of these relationships to the assessment of simple financial investments, loan repayments, interest rates, discounts for early payment, rent-or-buy problems, and so on. In later chapters we will apply the same arithmetic to assessing financial instruments and project plans.</p>
