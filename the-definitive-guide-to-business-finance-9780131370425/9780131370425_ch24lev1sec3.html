			<p class="docText">According to an old joke, every business has at least three sets of accounts: one for the tax authorities, one for the bankers, and one for the owners. Of course, the implication is that these figures are fixed or faked. You definitely do not want to be part of this. But where you are in control, you will want to restate the numbers to extract maximum value. Management, tax and financial reporting are each driven by differing objectives, and each produces a different view of the same numbers. In general, one should not influence the others directly. You want to select the most appropriate format for the task in hand – and you may well end up with three legitimately different sets of accounts.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EACAK" class="docSection2Title">Management accounting</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1091"></a><a id="iddle1340"></a><a id="iddle1684"></a><a id="iddle1749"></a><a id="iddle1957"></a><a id="iddle1976"></a><a id="iddle2105"></a><a id="iddle2140"></a>For day-to-day financial management, you need, as anyone would guess, management accounts. These will give you the most realistic view of events, since they are unencumbered by any statutory reporting requirements. Monthly figures are usually best – unless you are in retailing, in which case four-week periods offer good comparability. Use accruals accounting and common-sense costing. Bring in non financial metrics; ratios to headcount and volumes (sales, production, etc.) can be very revealing.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EAEAK" class="docSection2Title">Inspecting internal reports</h4>
				<p class="docText">Remember that your subordinates and colleagues who prepare financial reports are possibly unaware of, and probably not bound by, generally accepted accounting principles and accounting standards. These people might make mistakes of classification; and they may even indulge in deliberate window dressing, or worse. Ratios and charts can help you spot errors and oddities. Look back at <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch12lev1sec4.html#ch12fig05">Fig. 12.5</a> for a reminder of some areas where managers massage costs. Depending on the level of complexity of the reporting, you might need to be alert for the issues mentioned in the next paragraphs.</p>
			
			<a id="ch24lev2sec11"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0ESEAK" class="docSection2Title">Divisions, subsidiaries, partners and other investments</h4>
				<p class="docText">The rules for inspecting internal accounts apply when assessing any financials. In addition, there are some additional areas that deserve close attention. Crawl over the notes to the accounts; check contingent liabilities and off-balance sheet items. Recall that currency mismatches can result in unwelcome and unplanned losses (or gains). Watch for exceptional and extraordinary items which sneak in below the line in the profit and loss account.</p>
				<p class="docText">Remember, there are numerous tricks that can be played with assets. Their sale with an agreement to repurchase at a later date can remove them from the balance sheet. They might be revalued downwards to enable the sale of assets or the whole business at below market cost. Or they might have been revalued upwards to inflate the balance sheet and the net worth of the business.</p>
				<p class="docText">Question all transactions between related companies and business units. Market prices may go out of the window. Tax authorities and accounting regulators are strict about <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_439">transfer pricing</a></i>, but it is still common for a company to fix the rates at which it does business with related entities – and to conveniently convert profit centres into cost centres. Watch also for countertrade. Obviously, unless transactions are valued and reported honestly, this can artificially lower revenues. It can also lead to surprise hidden costs.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0ETNAK" class="docSection2Title">Comparing competitors</h4>
				<p class="docText">Recall that no two businesses will produce identical results even if they start with identical inputs. Important differentiating factors include relative levels of maturity, product lines, industry sectors, operating environments and operating cultures. On top of this, internal accounting policies and national accounting requirements will further influence reported results. Obviously, you need to keep this very much in mind when examining financials.</p>
				<p class="docText">Try to restate your competitors’ financials on a similar basis to yours. For every item, ask yourself why it was recorded as it was and if it could have been stated differently. Question the quality of the assets. Get hold of, or estimate, headcount, market share, and sales volumes; calculate ratios for everything and compare them to yours.</p>
