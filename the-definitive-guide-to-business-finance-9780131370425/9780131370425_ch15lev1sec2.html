			<p class="docText">Balance sheets are the paper tigers of financial reporting. They are as easy to understand as the profit and loss account – perhaps easier – but they are widely feared and misunderstood. Do not worry. If you have made it this far, there is nothing to fear in this chapter. The balance sheet is a snapshot of the net wealth of an entity – showing (in summary) everything it owns and owes. This tells you a great deal about past performance and the potential for the future.</p>
			<p class="docText">This chapter describes the balance sheet, what it is, how it is structured, what it shows, how to interpret it and how to project your own.</p>
			<a id="ch15lev2sec4"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EPGBI" class="docSection2Title">Flows and snapshots</h4>
				<p class="docText">You will recall from the previous chapter that a profit and loss account (P&amp;L) shows flows over time. You can add figures from two P&amp;Ls, each covering, say, six months, to find the totals for the year as a whole.</p>
				<p class="docText">In contrast, a balance sheet is a snapshot on a given date – say 30 June or 31 December. It is similar to the opening or closing balance on your bank statement; a statement of position at the close of business on one day. Logically, you cannot add two balance sheets. If you subtract one from another this will reveal the changes that took place between the two dates, but these are not total flows. As with the <span class="docEmphasis">bank statement</span> example, you would not know how much money came into and went out of an account between the opening and closing balances, only the net change.</p>
			
			<a id="ch15lev2sec5"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0E6GBI" class="docSection2Title">The balance sheet – what it is</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1118"></a><a id="iddle1438"></a><a id="iddle1514"></a><a id="iddle2025"></a>A balance sheet is nothing more complex than a statement of position at a given date. The balance sheet lists all the money owned or owed to (<i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_032">assets</a></i>) and owed by (<span class="docEmphasis">liabilities and</span>
					<i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_399">shareholders’ equity</a></i>) a business. I sense you were with me until I mentioned shareholders’ equity. Basically, you always want assets to exceed liabilities. The difference belongs to the owners; it is the stake (equity) of the shareholders. As mentioned in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a><a id="called"></a>, if a company were a person, shareholders’ equity would be called <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_324">owners’ equity</a></i><a id="or"></a> or <span class="docEmphasis">net worth</span>, as it is in a sole trader’s accounts. Arithmetically, shareholder’s equity always equals assets less liabilities. Or, to put it another way, assets equal liabilities plus shareholders’ equity, as shown in this little diagram:</p>

					<p class="docText">Let me stress once again that while a profit and loss account shows flows over a given period (say, one year), the balance sheet is a snapshot at the close of a given day (say, 31 December). You would be right in thinking that this leaves it open to <a id="iddle1060"></a><a id="iddle1109"></a><a id="iddle1111"></a><a id="iddle1120"></a><a id="iddle1121"></a><a id="iddle1724"></a><a id="iddle2206"></a><a id="iddle2208"></a>some manipulation – a roguish practice known endearingly as <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_465">window dressing</a></i>. For example, cash balances might have been very different the day before or the day after. Keep this in mind when you look at financial statements.</p>
				
			
			<a id="ch15lev2sec6"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EEMBI" class="docSection2Title">The balance sheet – what it shows</h4>
				<p class="docText">As indicated, every balance sheet has three sections – assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. They may be laid out differently from the examples given here. More traditional accounts show liabilities/equity and assets side by side rather than vertically. You will not find this difference intellectually taxing.</p>
				<p class="docText">Assets and liabilities may be classified into short and long term, and the entries are generally arranged in order of life expectancy. Regulators prefer (but do not usually demand) the specific identification of short-term assets and liabilities. Most companies do show current assets and liabilities and this certainly assists with analysis – the difference between the two is defined as working capital. The definition of short term may be in the notes to the financial statements, otherwise you can take it to be a year. The structure of a typical balance sheet is shown in <a class="docLink" href="#ch15fig01">Fig. 15.1</a>. As with the profit and loss account, let me run through this financial statement starting at the top. This time, it is more useful to focus on the entries rather than the totals.</p>

					<p class="docText">‘It is one thing for a company to “cook the books” by fraudulently inflating revenue through phoney sales or inventing phantom inventory. ... But some of the recent accounting scandals have involved a different kind of activity – companies asserting aggressive interpretations of GAAP to justify financial statement treatment, such as capitalization of expenses or so called “true sales” off assets to off-blalance sheet entities to remove debt from the balance sheet.’</p>

Time deposits are almost as good as paper money. Of course, any company should have enough liquidity to cover slumps in sales and other short-term crises.</p>
					<p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_258">Inventory</a></b> includes raw materials, part-completed work-in-progress and finished items. The extent to which these can be turned into cash varies, as does the underlying true market value. Again, the notes to the accounts should provide more details. Look for the accounting policy (FIFO, LIFO, etc. – see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</a>). If inventory is growing faster than sales this might be a sign of a slowdown, and of obsolete or outdated stocks. The example has a nil entry for inventory because this software company does not record any in its accounts.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0E3OCI" class="docSection2Title">The balance sheet – what it means</h4>
				<p class="docText">Contemporary reporting and disclosure standards make current balance sheets more valuable than they were a few decades back. Remember to read the notes to the financial statements. Then read between the lines.</p>
				<p class="docText">The previous few pages should have highlighted why each category of assets, liabilities and equity is important. However, there are other keys to unlocking the value of the balance sheet. One is the cash flow statement, considered in the next chapter. Other hints are included in the analysis and review of financials (<a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch17.html#ch17">Chapters 17</a> and <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch18.html#ch18">18</a>). And the section on funding (<a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>) will help you to interpret loans and shareholders’ equity.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0E3PCI" class="docSection2Title">The balance sheet – looking ahead</h4>
				<p class="docText">Projecting a balance sheet is a logical progression from the forecasting and estimating that you have done so far. There is an example in <a class="docLink" href="#ch15fig04">Fig. 15.4</a> (see p. <a class="docLink" href="#ch15fig04">234</a>), which was derived as follows. First, remember that any <span class="docEmphasis">total</span> in the profit and loss account is a <span class="docEmphasis">change</span> in the balance sheet. Then work through the items in the balance sheet, but not necessarily in top-to-bottom order for reasons that the following notes will make clear:</p>
				<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The fixed assets and inventory entries in the balance sheet are taken from analysis conducted in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch11.html#ch11">Chapters 11</a><a id="and"></a> and <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch13.html#ch13">13</a>. For example, spending of $1,500 on fixed assets was projected for month two, so the balance sheet total at the end of month two is $1,500 higher than the total at the end of month one.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Similarly, the entry for retained earnings <span class="docEmphasis">changes</span> by the amount of net profit in any one period.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><a id="accruals"></a>Prepayments and accruals <span class="docEmphasis">change</span> by the amounts recorded as, well, prepayments and accruals adjustments. You will have derived these figures when passing bookkeeping entries to shift transactions from the date that cash changes hands to the relevant accounting periods (e.g. to record July’s rent against July, and not against the month when you paid it – see accruals accounting in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>).</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Deposits paid and taken <span class="docEmphasis">change</span> by the amounts disbursed and received in each period.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><a id="iddle1019"></a><a id="iddle1024"></a><a id="iddle1132"></a><a id="iddle1221"></a>Accounts payable might be calculated in a similar manner to note 3 (which is the case in the example here). However, it is usually easier to project these as ratios. For example, if you receive the same average value of deliveries each week, if your suppliers give you 30 days’ credit, and if you make one payment a month, payables will average one-half of one month’s spending on supplies. On this basis, if your expenditure on materials, components, etc. is $10,000 in January, payables at end of that month will be $5,000. Note that this is not a change, it is the <span class="docEmphasis">actual</span> figure which shows in the balance sheet at end-month.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Accounts receivable can be calculated using either of the two methods just described for payables. However, do not forget to make an allowance for bad debts (<a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>).</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Other assets and liabilities (except cash, loans and share capital) are calculated on a similar basis to notes 4 and 5 above.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Cash, loans and share capital depend on your cash flow and financing policies. We will discuss these in more depth in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>. For the moment, pretend that share capital is fixed. One approach is to assume that cash balances remain at a level just sufficient to cover daily net cash requirements (perhaps some percentage of operating profit with depreciation added back in – because depreciation in the accounts does not involve spending real money), and loans increase or decrease by net cash flow over the period. Alternatively, you could assume that loans are fixed and let the cash balance change accordingly. You actually need more information – we will return to this after projecting cash flow (next chapter) and financing and investing (<a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>).</p></div></li></ol></div>

Then reconfirm that retained earnings changes by the amount of net profit in the projected profit and loss account. If either of these two sums is in error, you have made a mistake, possibly a transcription error, and you need to work through your figures again.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>
