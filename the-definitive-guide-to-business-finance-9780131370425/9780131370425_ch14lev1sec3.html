			<h3 class="docSection1Title">The income statement, or profit and loss account</h3>
			<p class="docText">In a curious departure from the pessimism for which we have come to know and love bean counters, the American branch of their family has managed to give the profit and loss statement (P&amp;L) an optimistic name. They call it an income statement, somehow ignoring the fact that it also includes costs – a lot of them too. Moreover, in the dismal days of the early millennium, when corporations around the world were announcing record losses, <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_242">income</a></i> statement might be considered a contradiction in terms. I stick with the term profit and loss because it seems less ambiguous, but the term income statement is increasing in popularity worldwide.</p>
			<a id="ch14lev2sec4"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EEBBI" class="docSection2Title">P&amp;L – what it is</h4>
				<p class="docText">A profit and loss account is exactly what it claims to be: basically, a record of sales, other revenues and costs, and gains and losses arising from ongoing operations. The bottom line in the P&amp;L is the bottom line for the business: the net profit or loss.</p>
				<p class="docText">The account does not include capital transactions, such as borrowing, investment and purchases of fixed assets, but it does show current income and costs (and, let me stress this, bookkeeping gains and losses) related to these items – interest, depreciation, and so on. The P&amp;L is a statement of flows – the money which pours into and out of the business in a given period of time, be it a month, quarter, year or some other interlude. As far as possible, transactions are matched to the period of the account using the accruals system already discussed.</p>

Deduct operating costs from gross profit to arrive at the operating profit (or loss). This is, perhaps, the core of the profit and loss account. It is the net income which results from normal operations. In case you overlook its importance, given that it is swamped by the rest of the P&amp;L shown here, remember that we have just spent several chapters reviewing these revenues and costs.

				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Profit from ongoing operations, before tax.</span> Working down <a class="docLink" href="#ch14fig01">Fig 14.1</a>, the next couple of entries show revenue, expenses, gains and losses which are not part of the company’s normal operations but which nevertheless arise from its very existence. Such transactions include interest paid on loans, interest received on bank deposits and similar instruments, and investment income. For analysis, they can be classified as recurring or non-recurring, depending on whether they feature regularly in the accounts. I have shown them separately to emphasize the fact that recurring items can, loosely speaking, be expected to exert an ongoing influence on the bottom line.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Profit from ongoing operations, after tax.</span> There is not too much to say about taxation, other than that your corporation will no doubt employ well-paid specialists to minimize the tax bill. Tax evasion is simple but illegal. Tax avoidance is legal, but complex. Taxes receive special attention in financials because no one much likes paying them – and reversing out taxes makes inter-company comparisons more reliable.</p>

In the short term, profits also provide rewards for the providers of capital (i.e. in plain English, dividends for shareholders), social welfare which is channelled through the tax authorities and government (i.e. taxation), and sometimes charitable donations. In the longer term, retained earnings are ploughed back into the business to fund future operations and growth (see <span class="docEmphasis"><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch17lev1sec5.html#ch17lev1sec5">Getting value</a></span>, <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch17.html#ch17">Chapter 17</a>).</p>
