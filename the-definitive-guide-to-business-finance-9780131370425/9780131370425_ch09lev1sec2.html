			<p class="docText">As an entrepreneur or manager, you are probably intensely concerned with ensuring that sales continue to rise year after year, or at worst stay steady; that inventory levels do not become too high or too low; that production is managed to keep pace with demand; or that some other indicators change in the right direction. If you are the chief executive you will be worried about all of these and more.</p>
			<p class="docText">There are some handy tricks which help you analyse and manage trends. The techniques are definitely not onerous and they can be delightfully revealing. It is well worth spending a few minutes becoming familiar with them. Essentially, you are doing nothing more strenuous than looking for patterns, and it is surprising how well this can help you do your job.</p>
			<p class="docText">There is the added benefit that once you have a feel for what has happened already, you are more than halfway to a decent forecast of what might happen in the future. This chapter, then, leads naturally into the next one: How to forecast anything. Given that business forecasting is usually about forecasting sales, sales are used as the examples here. You can, of course, apply the same techniques to any time series.</p>

This is known as <span class="docEmphStrong">time series analysis</span> by mathematicians and statisticians and as <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_235">horizontal analysis</a></b> by bean counters. It is different from analysis of <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_122">cross-sectional</a></b> data, which is a snapshot on a given date – such as sales by region in March, or quality control rejects from batch 1306, etc. Our beanie friends call this <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_460">vertical analysis</a></b> or <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_364">ratio analysis</a></b>. It is discussed elsewhere, notably in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch05.html#ch05">Chapters 5</a>, <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch18.html#ch18">18</a> and <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">19</a>.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>
