			<p class="docText">This chapter introduces the rudiments of financial record keeping. This is essential groundwork for understanding where the money comes from and where it goes. Of course, the topic has immediate practical applications if you are an entrepreneur, particularly if you are starting a new business, because you may well keep the books yourself. But even, or especially, if someone else is doing it for you, you need to understand what they are doing and why. Knowing these basics helps unlock many of the mysteries of what is possibly the world’s second-oldest profession.</p>
			<p class="docText">To try to give life to the topic, I have approached it from the point of view of an entrepreneur starting a business and maintaining financial accounts. The principles are the same for a one-person business or a huge multinational. The only difference is that in larger companies there will be a team of well-paid bean counters keeping the books using costly computer systems. If you wish, you can steal a march on them with some snappy low-cost software.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EFXAG" class="docSection2Title">A brief history of bookkeeping</h4>
				<p class="docText">The first bean counters recorded quantities by making notches in tally sticks. The sticks were then split in two and each party to the transaction kept one slice. Later, the two slices could be brought back together and compared to ensure that, shall I say, no mistakes were made. Today, tally sticks have been replaced by computer accounting systems, and the notches have evolved into a concept called double entry accounting. End of history lesson. I did say it would be brief.</p>
