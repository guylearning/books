			<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1660"></a>Suppose you were given two sets of figures for take-home pay shown on the left in <a class="docLink" href="#ch05fig08">Fig. 5.8</a>. How would you analyse them? These are the figures which are illustrated on pp. <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch05lev1sec4.html#ch05lev1sec4">62</a> and <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch05lev1sec5.html#ch05lev1sec5">63</a> – which should give you your first clue. You could easily use your spreadsheet to create revealing charts.</p>

			<p class="docText">Another handy trick is to use a spreadsheet for some simple analysis. Columns D and E show the simplest comparison (e.g. that in 2000 the accountant’s pay was more than $22,000 greater than that of the cleaner – or, looking at it from the other angle, the cleaner’s pay was less than 10% that of the beanie’s). The absolute changes (columns F and G) and percentage changes (columns H and I) are instructive, as are the index numbers (columns J and K). We will talk more about percentages in the next chapter. First, take a look at index numbers.</p>
			<a id="ch05lev2sec8"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EWJAG" class="docSection2Title">Indexing</h4>
				<p class="docText">Index numbers are nothing more than ordinary numbers on a standardized basis. Usually a value of 100 is chosen as the base, and all other numbers are expressed as a percentage of that base. To convert any number to an index:</p>
				<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Select a base (the year 2000 in the example) and note the actual value ($25,000 for the beanie).</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Divide every figure by the base value and multiply the result by 100.</p></div></li></ol></div>
				<p class="docText">This removes the effect of scale, and allows direct trends and relative movements. There is a catch. Two indexes will always converge at the base (where they both equal 100 – the year 2000 in this example). You can see this clearly if you look back at the charts on pp. <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch05lev1sec4.html#ch05lev1sec4">62</a>–<a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch01lev1sec1.html#ch01sb01">3</a>, <span class="docEmphasis">The beanie is caught/overtaken/lags</span>.</p>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle2052"></a><a id="iddle2078"></a>Index numbers are very good for examining relative movements – but you need to see the underlying figures (e.g. salary) to judge the absolute relationship between two amounts.</p>
				<a id="ch05sb05"></a><table cellspacing="0" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><td><table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td valign="top" style="width: 60px;">

					</td><td valign="top"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Relatives and absolutes.</span> Note the dollar signs in the formula =B14/$B$9*100. When you copy functions into new cells (e.g. by using the fill handle, see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch04lev1sec6.html#ch04fig01">Fig. 4.1</a>), the functions are updated to maintain the relative relationships with other cells – except that cell references prefixed with $ signs are not changed.</p><p class="docText">In this example, we want every figure in column J divided by the value in cell B9 – hence the absolute reference to B$9 (the relative relationship with column B is unchanged). When you are entering formulas, press F4 one or more times to insert the $ signs. Try it and you will see what I mean.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>
