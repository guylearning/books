			<p class="docText">Assuming that you have not skipped straight to the end to see whodunnit, I congratulate you on making it this far. We have taken a fairly hectic journey through the issues surrounding managing the numbers and we have covered a significant amount of ground. Thank you for staying with me. I guess that now is a good moment to pause and look back over the topics covered.</p>
			<p class="docText">We have discussed forecasting, estimating, reviewing, analysing and interpreting numbers. Moreover, we have considered these tasks in relation to topics as diverse as evaluating production, sales and overheads; preparing budgets; appraising projects, producing financial statements and reports; measuring individual or corporate performance; raising and investing funds; and undertaking a whole range of other jobs. The close interrelationship of all numerical issues should be clear. These final few pages pull together some of the key themes in this book.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0ETAAK" class="docSection2Title">Forecasting and estimating</h4>
				<p class="docText">When looking ahead, the trick is to identify what needs to be <span class="docEmphasis">forecast</span><a id="be"></a>, what can be <span class="docEmphasis">estimated</span> in relation to the forecast, and what needs to be treated as an <span class="docEmphasis">assumption</span> (a given). Examine the historical data using a spreadsheet to assist with the analysis. Find the patterns. Look for relationships with other factors, both internal (e.g. spending on advertising) and external (such as exchange rates). Apply management judgement and business knowledge, and make the forecast. Use ratios (headcount, spending, sales, etc.) to make the dependent estimations. Beg or borrow assumptions from reliable parties (government statisticians, economic institutes, etc.).</p>
				<p class="docText">That said, query assumptions and relationships. Ask what if? For example, what if interest rates rose 5%, sales fell 5% or your competitor cut prices by 5%? Use a distribution such as the <span class="docEmphasis">normal</span> to model risk. Assess break even, capacity limits, minimum prices, etc. Do the same for each product line. Question what you are doing, and why.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EKBAK" class="docSection2Title">Planning</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1145"></a><a id="iddle1774"></a><a id="iddle1849"></a><a id="iddle1856"></a><a id="iddle1979"></a><a id="iddle2009"></a><a id="iddle2147"></a>There is a great deal of truth in the old adage <span class="docEmphasis">if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.</span> Before you begin any analysis, or set out on a new path or project, do some planning (it seems as if I should plug my book here, <span class="docEmphasis">The Definitive Business Plan</span> 2006, revised edition, FT Prentice Hall). Identify what you can quantify, select performance metrics, and set milestones or targets. In other words, know in advance what you expect to see. Use the techniques in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch21.html#ch21">Chapters 21</a> to <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch23.html#ch23">23</a> to estimate the risks and set margins of latitude. Then you can measure the results against these expectations to see if everything is staying on track.</p>
				<p class="docText">Break projects into small, reversible steps. Map out your path in advance. Do not centralize budget planning; ensure that individual managers are involved and responsible. Prefer flexible, rolling budgets. Set assumptions and frameworks from the top down; set budget plans from the bottom up. Ensure that you provide an adequate contingency reserve. Do not confuse budget targets with performance measures; financial metrics should be only part of the measuring and reporting process. Continuously monitor the outturn; be prepared to restate budgets.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EUDAK" class="docSection2Title">Review</h4>
				<p class="docText">When given figures, question them ruthlessly. Do not assume that because they are in a complex spreadsheet they must be right. Check that the calculations are entered correctly – and then check the basis for the calculations. Again, check the assumptions and relationships. Beware of spurious accuracy. Create charts to see if trends look reasonable. See also the following comments.</p>
			
			<a id="ch24lev2sec7"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0E6DAK" class="docSection2Title">Monitoring and performance review</h4>
				<p class="docText">Anyone would be overwhelmed by too many metrics. The fewer that you can get by with, the better; 10 or 20 for any one area is probably the maximum. Remember also to look at unquantified factors, such as morale, prestige, and public relations. Guard against scope creep (where deliverable results expand over time). Be prepared to redefine targets as necessary.</p>
				<p class="docText">Measure the trend, and the trend in the trend. For example, there are clear warning signs if sales are running below target or spending is above target. You should also be cautious if sales are dropping nearer and nearer to the target each month, or if the gap between costs and the target is narrowing over time. The same applies to non-financial indicators, such as headcount, production levels, quality control failures, bugs in software under development, and so on.</p>
				<p class="docText">Use common-sense costing to determine the costs associated with each and every product, service and activity undertaken. Look for ratios everywhere. Always try to improve them. Be aware of the difference between profits and profitability when examining margins and your product mix.</p>
				<p class="docText">Do not review your activities in isolation. You might be doing fine, but are your competitors doing better? Benchmark yourself against your competitors and against the <span class="docEmphasis">best of breed</span> for specific activities such as inventory control or overseas sourcing of supplies.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0ETEAK" class="docSection2Title">Presentations</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1429"></a><a id="iddle1875"></a><a id="iddle1953"></a>When called upon to present numbers, start by identifying your storyline. What is it that you want to say? There is always a message, even if it is that you are reporting or predicting ‘no change’. What else do you have to tell your audience? Always assume that they are unfamiliar with the numbers, even if you told them the same story last month. Of course, be tactful. No one likes to be reminded that they were not paying attention, did not understand, or have simply forgotten. Perhaps begin with a statement such as: as <span class="docEmphasis">you will recall, by doing x, y, and z, we are in the situation where</span> ... No matter how depressing or embarrassing the subject matter, try to end on a positive note.</p>
				<p class="docText">When you know your story, plan the steps that will take your audience through it as smoothly as possible. Try to use handouts, a whiteboard or a computer presentation. If you decide on a Microsoft PowerPoint-type presentation, keep it simple. Skip the distracting razzmatazz and fancy transitions – although sensible use of illustrations can really help get the message across. Try to present data in chart format. Do not crowd charts – one message per picture is a good rule of thumb.</p>
				<p class="docText">Round all numbers to as few effective figures as possible (e.g. two or three), and consign more detailed figures to annexes, footnotes, or at least separate tables. Do not present figures in isolation. <span class="docEmphasis">Sales were $x</span> is not very meaningful. <span class="docEmphasis">Sales were $x, 15% higher than in the same month last year</span> is more useful. Generally, prefer percentages for comparisons. Compare like with like (remember seasonality).</p>
				<p class="docText">Rehearse your presentation. Ask yourself if it really tells the story that you want it to tell, and if the story you are telling is the right one. Then criticize it and make a list of the questions people will ask (at least some of which will be the obvious questions). Put yourself in the position of various members of your audience. Consider their personal agendas to see from which angle they will come at you. Finally, of course, prepare answers and slides or handouts for the potential questions. Always try to be one step ahead of your audience.</p>
