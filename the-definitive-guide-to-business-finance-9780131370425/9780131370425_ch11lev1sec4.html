			<a id="ch11lev2sec5"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0E2BAI" class="docSection2Title">Does it hurt?</h4>
				<p class="docText">Capital spending can be tangible or intangible. It can be on machines that you can touch and feel, or items of intellectual property such as software development and registering patents – stuff that is much harder to physically hurt yourself with.</p>
				<a id="ch11note04"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">What’s not capital</p>
					<p class="docText">Under certain circumstances – especially if software is your business – you can treat software <span class="docEmphStrong">development</span> as capital spending. Mostly, you cannot capitalize spending on <span class="docEmphStrong">research</span>, start-ups, training and advertising, internally generated goodwill, brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and similar items.</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">Unlike most current expenditure, capital outlays are expected to produce benefits (and perhaps incur costs) in the future. These may be obvious and tangible, as with investment property or a clump press. Or the costs and benefits may be somewhat hard to measure, as in the instance of desktop computers for your beanies. Moreover, the future revenue and expenditure associated with assets may be straightforward (production machinery), or complex (as with mergers and acquisitions).</p>
			
			<a id="ch11lev2sec6"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EXCAI" class="docSection2Title">Approvals</h4>
				<p class="docText">The approvals process, as with any other spending request, will require you to show why you need the sprocket grinder, flange flipper or whatever asset it is, and what costs and benefits will relate to its acquisition. The uniqueness of capital spending is that the benefits – and some of the costs – are not all immediate, but they will occur at sometime in the future. Capital budgeting and related topics are covered in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch22.html#ch22">Chapter 22</a>. Remember to consider alternative approaches to acquiring one asset, which may include alternative production methods, outsourcing, and leasing (see below).</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EJDAI" class="docSection2Title">Acquisition</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1047"></a><a id="iddle1067"></a><a id="iddle1077"></a><a id="iddle1302"></a><a id="iddle1480"></a><a id="iddle1566"></a><a id="iddle1621"></a><a id="iddle1747"></a><a id="iddle1864"></a><a id="iddle2126"></a>For some assets, acquisition involves nothing more complex than taking delivery (passenger vehicles) or perhaps simple installation (plugging in a photocopier). For other items, such as a mainframe computer or a new building, acquisition may involve a separate project in its own right. Project management is discussed in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch21.html#ch21">Chapter 21</a>.</p>

					<p class="docText">Under <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_255">international accounting standards</a></b>, if you can demonstrate that a website is capable of generating direct revenues by enabling orders to be placed, you can treat the <span class="docEmphStrong">website development costs</span> as capital spending. A website intended primarily for promoting and advertising your products and services does not qualify.</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">Costs associated with bringing an asset into use can usually be treated as part of the capital outlay. These overheads can include delivery, installation, perhaps computer software, and other items which would otherwise be treated as consumption. For construction projects, international accounting standards permit you to capitalize borrowing costs.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0E2GAI" class="docSection2Title">Expected life</h4>
				<p class="docText">You may find that your company has specific depreciation policies which arbitrarily define the expected life of certain categories of assets – such as two years for PCs. Many tax authorities define arbitrary lives for tax purposes. There may also be statutory limits, such as 20 or 40 years for buildings. Other examples are as follows. You do not have to use any of these periods for management analysis, but be prepared to defend your reasoning.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Machinery and equipment.</span> Typical depreciation periods used in company accounts include three years for computers, five years for office equipment, 10 years for some industrial machinery, 20 years for a jumbo jet and 100 years for airport runways (I didn’t think that this last example was reasonable either).</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Fitting of premises.</span> Spending on fittings that you cannot take with you – fixed partitioning, plumbing, cabling, decorating – is treated as freehold improvements (if you own the premises) or leasehold improvements (if you rent). Such spending is amortized over the shorter of the life of the fittings, the lease or the building.</p>

					<p class="docText">New US accounting rules requiring companies to record at once any decline in the value of goodwill resulted in AOL Time Warner posting a world-record one-time charge against profits in 2002 – with a $54bn write-down in the value of AOL’s purchase of Time Warner.</p>

				<p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_229">Goodwill</a></b>. Goodwill is the difference between the price you pay to buy another company and the net value of its assets. It represents the expectation of future cash flow that can be generated by, for example, trading on a name or location. Your accounts cannot show the goodwill value that you attach to your own company. But if you are taken over, the acquiring company can show your goodwill and amortize it over up to 20 years (longer if they can <a id="iddle1034"></a><a id="iddle1092"></a><a id="iddle1242"></a><a id="iddle1289"></a><a id="iddle1327"></a><a id="iddle1330"></a><a id="iddle1335"></a><a id="iddle1675"></a><a id="iddle1838"></a><a id="iddle1846"></a><a id="iddle2093"></a><a id="iddle2136"></a>justify expecting financial benefits to continue to flow in). Note that the 20-year rule is an international accounting standard; it has been more common for companies in Europe to write off goodwill immediately on acquisition by charging it to shareholders’ equity. (But see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>.)</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Other intellectual property.</span> The cost of acquiring patents, copyrights, trademarks and other licences is written off over their expected useful lives – which are often much less than the statutory protection afforded. A copyright, for example, generally lives for 50 years after the originator’s death. Will the works have such a long life? You would probably write off the copyright on a fleetingly famous celebrity’s novels over a much shorter period.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EPMAI" class="docSection2Title">Running and maintenance costs</h4>
				<p class="docText">Fixed assets usually involve running costs and maintenance costs, which you will need to estimate for management analysis.

However, industry surveys estimate that the <span class="docEmphStrong">total cost of ownership</span> for an office PC is anywhere from $7,500 to $15,000 a year after you take into account the costs of administration and support by the IT department and other unbudgeted costs.</p><p class="docText">Take another example, when your computer network goes down, it could be costing you hundreds of thousands of dollars an hour in lost productivity. I have seen figures somewhere showing that in the 1990s, network downtime cost American Express $170,000 a minute and brokerage house Charles Schwab $1 million a minute – and this is one of the costs of owning an asset that you would rather not own at that precise moment.</p><p class="docText">To get at the true costs and benefits of an asset, you have to brainstorm and identify all the obvious and not so obvious factors, which may stretch well across departmental boundaries. There is an upside for the cynical: every time that you spend $2,500 on a PC (which, obviously, you estimate will bring some economic benefits to your business area), you are making it $10,000 harder for your IT department to meet their budget.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>

Use your knowledge of the market for similar assets, expectations of technological change, and other crystal-ball gazing to arrive at a reasonable estimate of what you can sell the asset for when you have finished with it.</p>
				<p class="docText">If there are likely to be costs involved in the disposal of an asset at the end of its useful life, you probably have the option of including the estimated outlays in the ‘depreciation’ schedule or expensing them at the end of the period.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0ESQAI" class="docSection2Title">Benefits</h4>
				<p class="docText">At last we come to the whole purpose of acquiring assets – to obtain a future stream of revenue. This may be explicit, as with production machinery, or highly intangible, as with PCs for administrative use. The rationale for acquiring an asset came out of your planning and forecasting process. So will the benefits. These are discussed more fully in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch21.html#ch21">Chapter 21</a>.</p>
			
			<a id="ch11lev2sec12"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EERAI" class="docSection2Title">Depreciation</h4>
				<p class="docText">There are many ways to calculate depreciation. You may need to use one method for management analysis, another for financial reporting, and sometimes a third for tax calculations. This might sound a bit silly. The situation arises because tax authorities and financial accounting regulators do not always talk to each other, and both may have aims which differ from the manager’s objective of estimating the strict economic benefits. If nothing else, this illustrates that there is no universally applicable way of estimating depreciation.</p>
				<a id="ch11note07"></a><div class="docNote">
					<p class="docText">In the US, both the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) and generally accepted accounting principles allow <span class="docEmphStrong">declining-balance</span> depreciation – which the IRS calls Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS).</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">Let me explain three ways of calculating depreciation with a ruler. The first, the <span class="docEmphasis">straight-line</span> method introduced above, simply assumes an equal amount of depreciation in each year of the asset’s life. The next two, which may sound off-putting but which are delightfully simple, are known by bean counters as the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_423">sum-of-the-year’s-digits</a></i>, and <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_162">double-declining-balance</a></i> depreciation. These are actually quite nifty techniques which <span class="docEmphasis">accelerate</span> (front-load) the depreciation. This is generally more realistic, given that the fastest drop in an asset’s value usually occurs precisely when you are heaving it out of the showroom. The calculations are as follows, using as an example a $10,000 asset with a five-year life and no residual value (see <a class="docLink" href="#ch11fig02">Fig. 11.2</a>):</p>
				<ul><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Straight-line.</span> Divide the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_150">depreciable base</a></i> (i.e. acquisition price less estimated residual value) by the number of years of expected service; e.g. depreciation is $10,000 / 5 = $2,000 a year.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_423">Sum-of-the-year’s-digits</a></b>. Number the years of useful life in reverse order counting down to one (e.g. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1). Find the sum (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15). Divide each year by the sum (<img src="9780131370425_ch11lev1sec4_image03.jpeg" alt="" width="15" height="25"/>, <img src="9780131370425_ch11lev1sec4_image04.jpeg" alt="" width="15" height="23"/>, <img src="9780131370425_ch11lev1sec4_image05.jpeg" alt="" width="15" height="23"/>, <img src="9780131370425_ch11lev1sec4_image06.jpeg" alt="" width="15" height="22"/> and <img src="9780131370425_ch11lev1sec4_image07.jpeg" alt="" width="15" height="22"/><a id="the"></a>) and multiply the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_150">depreciable base</a></i> by these factors to find the depreciation. In the example here, depreciation in the first year is 10,000 × <img src="9780131370425_ch11lev1sec4_image08.jpeg" alt="" width="15" height="25"/> = $3,333. For the second year it is $10,000 × <img src="9780131370425_ch11lev1sec4_image09.jpeg" alt="" width="15" height="23"/> = $2,667 and so on.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_162">Double-declining-balance</a></b>. Calculate the straight-line depreciation as above. Find the percentage depreciation in the first year, and double it (2,000/10,000 * 2 = 0.4 or 40%). Use this factor to calculate depreciation on the <span class="docEmphasis">outstanding balance</span>, but if the depreciation is less than the straight-line amount for the same period, use that amount instead, until the asset is completely written off. In this example, in the first two years the depreciation is 40% of the opening balance each year. However, in the third year, depreciation is higher when calculated using the straight-line method, so the straight-line figure is used.</p></li></ul>

					</td><td valign="top"><h2 class="docSidebarTitle">Interpretation</h2><p class="docText">These three depreciation methods discussed above are illustrated in <a class="docLink" href="#ch11fig02">Fig. 11.2</a>. In each case, the depreciation is the figure which is charged against income (see the profit and loss account in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch14lev1sec3.html#ch14fig01">Fig. 14.1</a>), while the net asset value is the figure shown in the balance sheet. Depreciation is a pure bookkeeping entry and has no effect on cash flow.</p><p class="docText">Note that when using the double declining balance method, net profit is lowered by twice as much ($4,000) as it would be using straight-line depreciation, while the value of assets on the balance sheet is only $6,000 compared with $8,000 using the straight-line method. Now imagine this scaled up for a company with millions or billions of dollars of assets. Depending on the depreciation method chosen, the financials can look very different even though the company’s operations are fundamentally unaltered.</p><p class="docText">Of course, accelerated depreciation, as with the double declining balance method, lowers reported profits and therefore cuts, or at least defers, a tax liability.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>

A more rational approach is to pro-rata the depreciation according to the economic benefits that you expect to flow from an asset. For example, if you have a noisy machine that you estimate will punch out 20 million bottle tops in its lifetime and you predict that it will (or, with hindsight, you know that it did) produce 2 million in its first year of life, then depreciation for that period could be stated as <img src="9780131370425_ch11lev1sec4_image12.jpeg" alt="" width="15" height="23"/> of the depreciable base amount.</p>

The formulas for declining balance (DDB and VDB – the V stands for variable) sort of work. DDB does not switch to the straight-line method, and so does not fully depreciate the asset. VDB will switch out of the declining balance calculation, but does its own straight-line over the remaining months (i.e. averages the remaining depreciation) rather than converting to straight-line over the <span class="docEmphasis">whole life</span> of the asset.
