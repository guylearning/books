			<p class="docText">There are two good reasons for knowing the exact cost of each of the various financing options. The first is so that you can choose between them. The second is that that you know overall the rate or return you need to beat (the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_236">hurdle rate</a></i>) in order for any project to be successful – I will come back to this in the next chapter.</p>

				<p class="docText">‘Although many of the proposals are consistent with standards issued in Canada and the United States during 2001, the IASB has drawn on requirements in other jurisdictions when it believed a higher quality solution existed. This project is a good example of how convergence can and should work – for instance, the [US Financial Accounting Standards Board] has agreed to reconsider its own standards ...’.</p>

			<p class="docText">Estimating and comparing the cost of various types of debt is a breeze when you use the spreadsheet formula explained in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>. For a borrower, there is an inflow (the principal amount of the loan) and a series of outflows (any arrangement fee and <a id="iddle1147"></a><a id="iddle1210"></a>commission, interest, and the repayment of the principal). You can plug these values into a spreadsheet to standardize and compare interest rates. As already indicated, you can do much the same sums with leases, hire purchase and rental agreements.</p>
			<p class="docText">It is slightly more tricky to value equity. The simplest way is to project future dividends per share allowing for growth, treat the current stock price as the inflow, and again use a spreadsheet to determine the rate of interest that ties these amounts together.</p>
			<p class="docText">An alternative is known grandly as the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_065">capital asset pricing model</a></i>. To cut a long story short, we can arrive at a cost of capital (a pseudo-interest rate) by starting with the interest rate on risk free investment and marking it up by the return required to compensate for the risk of holding shares in a specific company. The risk factor of investing in any one company is known as its <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_049">beta</a></i>. This measures the extent to which a company share price moves relative to the market. For example, if share prices on average rise by 1%, the share price of a company with a beta of 1.5 will rise 1.5%, while the share price of a company with a beta of 0.5% will rise by, you guessed, only 0.5%. You will be delighted to know that industry analysts calculate and publish betas for companies quoted on the world’s major stock markets. You can access these through this book’s website (where there are also calculators that you can use to estimate the cost of capital for equity and the effective interest rate on debt).</p>
			<p class="docText">Multiply your beta by the average stock market rate of return to arrive at the risk premium. For example, if the market is paying 5% more than government securities and your beta is 1.6, your risk premium is 8% (5% × 1.6). If the coupon on government securities is 7%, the required rate of return on your equity (i.e. your cost of equity capital) is 7% + 8% = 15%.</p>

				</td><td valign="top"><p class="docText">The overall cost of capital reflects gearing – the mix of loans and equity.

				<p class="docText">‘[The Europeans] see options [as] an unfair competition and need to pull us down to their own miserable levels of opportunity and performance. Europe has tried and failed to use options to motivate innovation and spread ownership. Unable to unleash the creative power of their own economies, Europeans, particularly bureaucrats, are appalled at the willingness of American workers to accept low wages and willingly work 50 and 60 hour weeks in return for a sliver of ownership in their own business. Using “convergence of accounting standards” as a political grail, they plan to lower America to their own pitiful level of innovation and labour mobility.’</p>
