				<h4 id="title-ID0EGNAC" class="docSection2Title">Overview</h4>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Each chapter in this book contains a survival kit similar to this one. This idea is to provide an outline of what to expect, what you need to bring to the chapter and what you might take away with you. I hope that you will revisit the survival kit when you have finished the chapter, and make sure that I was successful in conveying the message intended.</span></p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphRomanAlt">This chapter provides a quick overview of what you can expect from the book and where to find it. Note that there is additional supporting material on this book’s website</span>

				<h4 id="title-ID0ECOAC" class="docSection2Title">Prerequisites</h4>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphRomanAlt">The general objective is to make this book stand-alone. All you need to bring to it is general business common sense and/or business competence. Where one chapter relies on material from earlier pages, this is outlined in the</span>
					<span class="docEmphasis">prerequisites</span>
					<span class="docEmphRomanAlt">section of the survival kit.</span></p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphRomanAlt">This chapter, of course, requires no prior knowledge other than an ability to read and a desire to achieve mastery over managing the numbers or, more realistically, to achieve competence with a numbers-related task that you have to find out how to solve before a deadline.</span></p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EYOAC" class="docSection2Title">Mastering this book</h4>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphRomanAlt">The aim of the</span>
					<span class="docEmphasis">Mastering this book</span>
					<span class="docEmphRomanAlt">section is to provide a ten-point checklist of questions that you should be able to answer after reading the chapter. If you can answer the questions, you can speak with confidence and walk with financial giants. Well, that’s the plan. It seems that I have failed at the first hurdle. I can explain away this failure by saying that since this chapter is just an introduction, I have let you off with just five questions (answers in the text):</span></p>

I try not to insult your intelligence by labouring the definitions of new terminology, but if I have been too brief, try the glossary at the back of the book (or this book’s website). There is not really any new gobbledygook in this chapter, but here are a couple of new-in-this-chapter terms by way of illustration:</p>
