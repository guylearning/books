			<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1420"></a><a id="iddle1421"></a><a id="iddle2054"></a><a id="iddle2062"></a><a id="iddle2063"></a><a id="iddle2073"></a>Think of a spreadsheet as being a page in a note pad. Each page is ruled off into a large number of rows and columns. This creates a grid of little boxes, each of which is called a cell. You type descriptive text (e.g. budget categories, names), numbers or instructions into the cells. The layout of cells gives order to your text and numbers, but the real power of spreadsheets is that they can understand and act on your instructions. You can tell the spreadsheet to perform useful tasks such as ‘add up the numbers in the five rows above this cell and show me the result’ or ‘if the number in this cell is negative display it in red’. Generally, when you look at a spreadsheet, you see the results rather than the underlying instructions. A couple of keystrokes will reveal the instructions if you need to review them.</p>

				<p class="docText">To save your spreadsheet for future use, choose <span class="docEmphStrong">Save</span> or <span class="docEmphStrong">Save As</span> from the <span class="docEmphStrong">File</span> menu, and in the dialog box that appears type a name for the file.</p>
				<p class="docText">By default, Excel files have the ending ‘.xls’. such as ‘salary .xls’. You can probably work out what xls indicates. Actually, they should perhaps be designated xlw files, because they contain workbooks, each of which can contain one or many spreadsheets.</p>
				<p class="docText">Note that the xls <span class="docEmphStrong">extension</span> might be hidden from view, depending how your version of Windows is set up.</p>
			</div><br/>
			<p class="docText">If this sounds too good to be true, there is a rub. To get round the problem that people might issue their commands differently, the instructions are standardized in a kind of shorthand. Its not much of a rub, though. The shorthand is mainly self-evident. Moreover, the instructions that you will use 90% of the time are so easy to remember that you will not have to refer often to the helpful built-in guides.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0E42AE" class="docSection2Title">Getting started</h4>
				<p class="docText">When your spreadsheet application springs into life you will be greeted with a screen such as that shown in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch04lev1sec6.html#ch04fig01">Fig. 4.1</a>.</p>
				<p class="docText">Note how the columns are labelled with letters and the rows are indicated with numbers. A spreadsheet can have over 250 columns and more than 65,000 rows – enough for most expenses claims. In case you wondered, when you get to column Z, the lettering continues at AA, AB, and so on. Each cell can be uniquely identified by the appropriate column and row designators.</p>
				<p class="docText">To gain some familiarity with a spreadsheet application, open it and drop down (i.e. click on) each menu in turn to see what is on it. Much of it won’t make sense if it is completely new to you, but you will spot some things which are self-evident. On most Microsoft products you will have to click on the double arrow at the bottom of a menu (or double-click at the top) in order to see all the options. I guess that the Seattle Giant thinks that an abbreviated menu is more user-friendly. It makes me incredibly irritated.</p>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle2071"></a>Also, right-click on the work area and on some surrounding elements and up will pop more menus with more options – such as the one at the bottom of <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch04lev1sec6.html#ch04fig01">Fig. 4.1</a> which can be used to add and rename spreadsheets.</p>

					<h5 id="title-ID0ED4AE" class="docSection3Title">A virtual desktop</h5>
					<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch04lev1sec6.html#ch04fig01">Figure 4.1</a> shows a computer desktop with Excel in use. Note that cells A4 to A15 are selected.</p>
					<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Fast shortcut:</span> The months were entered as follows: Cell A4 was selected by clicking it with the mouse. The word <span class="docEmphasis">Jan</span> was keyed into the cell, and the fill handle was then dragged down another 11 rows with the mouse. The spreadsheet automatically generated the months Feb–Dec. The same trick works with numbers, and you can create your own lists – choose <span class="docEmphasis">Tools/Options</span> and in the dialog box that appears, click the tab marked <span class="docEmphasis">Custom Lists</span>.</p>
					<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">For the experienced:</span> Right-click on the very edge of a selection box, drag to a new location, and release the mouse button. A popup menu will offer you various handy options. I frequently use the one listed as <span class="docEmphasis">Copy here as values</span> to freeze the results of formulas and prevent recalculation.</p>

The cursor will acquire a question mark. If you now click on anything on the Excel screen, a little pop-up description will appear. Go ahead and click on things to see what they do.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>

					<h5 id="title-ID0E4CAG" class="docSection3Title">Mouse and keyboard jargon</h5>
					<ul><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Point-and-click:</span> issue a command using the mouse. Move the mouse and a pointer on the screen echoes the movement; position the screen pointer over something (e.g. a menu item) and click the mouse buttons briefly to make things happen. The standard <span class="docEmphStrong">click</span> is a quick press on the left button. A <span class="docEmphStrong">double-click</span> is two rapid clicks on the left button. A <span class="docEmphStrong">right-click</span> (right mouse button) often does useful stuff.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Mac right-click:</span> Apple Computers decided that the creative types who use Macs would not be able to cope with more than one mouse button – and stubbornly refuse to admit that they are wrong. To <span class="docEmphasis">right-click</span> on a Mac, hold down the <span class="docEmphasis">Shift</span> key on the keyboard and press the single mouse button. That’s easier?</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Select/highlight:</span> choose something (e.g. text) with which you want to work. <span class="docEmphasis">Left-click</span> and hold the button down, move the mouse, release the button – and whatever was under the mouse movement will be highlighted (assuming it was selectable).</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Drag-and-drop:</span> move something (e.g. text) using the mouse. First <span class="docEmphasis">select</span> the item, then point at it again, <span class="docEmphasis">right-click</span> and hold, move the mouse to the required location, and release the button.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Cut, copy and paste:</span> a useful method of duplicating or moving things. For example, if you select some text and <span class="docEmphasis">copy</span><a id="the"></a> it to the <span class="docEmphasis">clipboard</span>, the text will be available to <span class="docEmphasis">paste</span> (insert) elsewhere in the same or a different document. If instead of using <span class="docEmphasis">copy</span> you <span class="docEmphasis">cut</span> the text, it is deleted from the original location. You can issue the commands using various menus and icons and, usually, a right-click. Handy <span class="docEmphasis">keyboard shortcuts</span> are <span class="docEmphasis">Shift-Del</span> to cut and <span class="docEmphasis">Shift-Ins</span> to paste. <span class="docEmphasis">Ctrl-Ins</span> performs a copy (i.e. without a cut). A right-click on selected text often brings up a menu with copy, cut and paste options.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Clipboard:</span> a temporary and usually invisible storage area inside the computer (see <span class="docEmphasis">cut</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">copy</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">paste</span>).</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keyboard shortcuts:</span> quick ways of doing things using the keyboard instead of the mouse. The shortcuts usually involve pressing two or more keys at the same time. For example, <span class="docEmphasis">Shift-Del</span> (see <span class="docEmphasis">cut</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">copy</span><a id="and"></a> and <span class="docEmphasis">paste</span>) is done by holding down the shift key, pressing <span class="docEmphasis">Del</span> and then releasing both keys.</p></li></ul>
