			<p class="docText">There is no need to mention that if you are doing business across borders you probably need to manage foreign currency issues. Each day, an average of $1 trillion changes hand in the <span class="docEmphasis">foreign exchange markets.</span> There is no formal trading floor, as there are with stock exchanges and cattle markets. Currency trading takes place 24 hours a day between bankers over telephone and computer links (good business for telecoms providers).</p>
			<p class="docText"><i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_213">Forex dealers</a></i> have a rich jargon of their own. Fortunately, you will be spared much of this because you will typically transact with your bankers or specialist currency brokers and they will communicate with the forex people. However, for your protection, buzz words are highlighted in the following pages.</p>
			<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">The price of someone else’s money.</span> <a id="iddle1455"></a><a id="iddle1456"></a><a id="iddle1467"></a><a id="iddle1694"></a>It is as well to cover the basics first. Starting right at the beginning: exchange rates are the price of one country’s money in terms of another. For example, when you see that the dollar is 1.10 <span class="docEmphasis">to the euro</span>, this means that one euro will buy $1.10. Put simply, €1 = $1.10. Commentators sometimes refer to this as the euro/dollar rate, which is a trifle misleading. Avoid confusion by identifying clearly the <span class="docEmphasis">denominator</span> currency with a value of one; the euro in the example here.</p>
			<p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_123">Currency conversions</a></b>. To convert an amount from, say, euros to dollars, multiply by the dollar-per-euro rate. If you have 2 million euros and the rate is €1 = US $1.10, the dollar amount is €2 million × 1.10 = $2.2 million. Alternatively, if you have dollars, divide by this rate to find the euro equivalent: $2.2 million ÷ 1.10 = €2 million.</p>
			<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Inverted rates.</span> Divide into one to find <span class="docEmphasis">inverse</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">reciprocal</span> rates. If €1 = US $1.10 then one dollar will buy 1 ÷ $1.10 euros; i.e. $1 = €0.91.</p>
			<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Cross rates.</span> If you know two rates you can calculate a third. For example, if one euro will buy $1.05 or ¥125, then obviously you could swap dollars for yen (or vice versa) at a rate of $1.05 = ¥125 (assuming for the moment that there are no transaction charges). Divide both sides by the required denominator to find a per-dollar or per-yen rate. For example, dividing through by 1.05 gives the answer $1 = ¥119.05, as shown in the following table. Incidentally, since one yen will buy less than one US cent, it is conventional to quote rates per 100 units of the Japanese currency.</p>

			<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Appreciation.</span> When an exchange rate gets numerically larger, the denominator is getting <span class="docEmphasis">stronger</span> and the other currency is <span class="docEmphasis">weakening.</span> For example, if the rate leapt from €1 = $1.00 to €1 = $2.00, the euro would have <span class="docEmphasis">appreciated</span> by 100%. Obviously, the dollar would not have <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_151">depreciated</a></i> by 100% or it would have zero value. To find the second currency’s movement, invert the rates first. In this example, the dollar has plunged from $1 = €1.00 to $1 = €0.50; a 50% depreciation.</p>

Instead, the parties resort to countertrade such as barter where, for example, one company pays in widgets for another entity’s cogs and sprockets. Variations include the creatively named offset, buyback, tolling and switch-trading.</p><p class="docText">Obviously, these are popular when foreign exchange restrictions and other regulations limit the scope for conventional business. Countertrade might lead you into new territory dealing in some new goods or commodities. The most important point, for your own financials and when examining others, is to check that valuations are realistic and that the associated costs are well covered.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/>
