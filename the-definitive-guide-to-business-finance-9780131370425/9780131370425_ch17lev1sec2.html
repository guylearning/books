			<p class="docText">Now is a good point at which to pull together the previous few chapters and look at what you might find in published financials. These might be formal reports to a regulatory agency, such as a quarterly report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or a glossy annual report aimed primarily at the public at large. The chapter starts by considering what you can expect to uncover in an annual report, because this is by far the best-known delivery platform for published financial data.
