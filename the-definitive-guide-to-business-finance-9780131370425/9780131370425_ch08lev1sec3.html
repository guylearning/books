			<p class="docText">If you are in command of everything that flows through your bank account you have complete control over your finances – in a regulatory sense even if not from the perspective of understanding what is going on. We will dispose of any problems of understanding in future chapters.</p>
			<p class="docText">All the paperwork we have done so far would not be any use without the final step – bank reconciliation. This is not about keeping your bank manager smiling. It is about making sure that you, your bosses and auditors are happy. When the bank statement arrives, it will almost certainly differ from the ledger balance (the balance in your accounting system). You need to find out why, and make any corrections that are necessary.</p>
			<p class="docText">A sample bank statement, an extract from your records, and the reconciliation of the two are shown in <a class="docLink" href="#ch08fig01">Fig. 8.1</a>. If you compare these you will see that two recent cheques (123034 and 35) have not yet been presented to the bank, and there was a $5,000 deposit which a generous client transferred to your account without notifying you. These items are noted in the reconciliation and explain the difference between the bank balance and your closing ledger balance. You will now locate details of the payment from the client, record that in your own accounts, and presumably send a receipt to the client.</p>

			<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1166"></a><a id="iddle1254"></a><a id="iddle2180"></a>Note that the previous reconciliation would have noted that two cheques (numbered 123012 and 123028) had not been presented to your bank. These have shown up on this statement. They are checked off now, thus ensuring that each item is charged to your bank account once only. Banks make mistakes too. You need to watch them, as well as your own records.</p>
