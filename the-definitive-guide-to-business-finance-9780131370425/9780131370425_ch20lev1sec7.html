The best known of these require the presentation of key documents (see inset) and as a result they are known loosely as <span class="docEmphasis">documentary credits, letters of credit</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">LCs</span>. The shorthand term <span class="docEmphasis">DC</span> is sometimes used, but this has a different meaning in the US.</p>

				<p class="docText">Key documents of foreign trade:</p>
				<ul><li><p class="docList">detailed invoice;</p></li><li><p class="docList">bill of lading (a sort of shipping list providing terms of carriage, proof of ownership and a receipt from the shippers);</p></li><li><p class="docList">insurance certificate;</p></li><li><p class="docList">inspection certificate/s;</p></li><li><p class="docList">customs papers.</p></li></ul>
			</div><br/>
			<p class="docText">When a bank issues a letter of credit, it is guaranteeing to release payment on presentation of the specific documents. Incidentally, about 50% of all letters of credit are delayed or rejected by pernickety bankers because of sometimes trivial discrepancies in the documents. The key LCs, and some other examples of the numerous forms of trade finances are as follows:</p>
			<ul><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Import letters of credit</span> guarantee that a supplier will be paid.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Export letters of credit</span> guarantee that you will receive payment for your sales.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Standby letters of credit</span> provide a guarantee in case one party cannot fulfil contractual or financial obligations.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Packing credit</span> finances the exporter’s inventory against the documentary evidence of the order.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Shipping guarantees</span> allow importers to take possession of the goods immediately upon arrival.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">Trust receipts</span> are issued by importers undertaking to hold goods in trust for the bank, pending sale.</p></li></ul>
			<p class="docText">Your bankers will advise you about their services and the associated costs. You can convert these prices into effective interest rates (see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>) for comparison and cost estimation – and build them into your projections when assessing the viability of a transaction.</p>
