			<p class="docText">There is one important issue which I do want to touch on now – what might be called public financial reporting. All businesses have to file various financial returns with government regulators; public corporations publish glossy annual reports; and most if not all companies will at some time give financial information to trade partners, creditors, bankers, investors, shareholders and other nosey people. It hardly needs to be said that the law imposes certain obligations on such reporting. As already mentioned, directors can be held personally liable for misreporting. It is, therefore, rather important for managers to understand the basics of these obligations. Let me introduce the concepts here, but deal with the specifics a bit later in the appropriate chapters.</p>
			<a id="ch02note04"></a><div class="docNote">
				<p class="docText">In the UK, the Companies Act 1985 includes provisions relating to:</p>
				<ul><li><p class="docList">maintaining accounting records;</p></li><li><p class="docList">the form and content of annual accounts;</p></li><li><p class="docList">generally acceptable accounting practices;</p></li><li><p class="docList">the publication to shareholders and the public filing of annual accounts;</p></li><li><p class="docList">the requirements for annual accounts to be audited;</p></li><li><p class="docList">the enforced correction of unsatisfactory annual accounts.</p></li></ul>
				<p class="docText">A new Companies Act went onto the statute books in 2005. The aim was to develop <span class="docEmphStrong">a simple, modern, efficient and cost effective framework for business activity in Britain for the twenty-first century</span>. Among other things, this means codifying directors’ responsibilities (see p. <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch17lev1sec3.html#ch17note02">253</a>).</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EDIAE" class="docSection2Title">What is financial reporting?</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1006"></a><a id="iddle1013"></a><a id="iddle1041"></a><a id="iddle1045"></a><a id="iddle2173"></a>A company’s financial reports summarize its historical financial performance. A full set includes a profit and loss account (showing totals for sales and net profit in specified periods – usually each covering three months or a year), a balance sheet (showing debts, assets and other indicators of financial standing at a given date) and usually a cash flow statement. There will also be other figures and written notes to aid interpretation. We will discuss all this in detail later.</p>
			
			<a id="ch02lev2sec8"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EBKAE" class="docSection2Title">National differences</h4>
				<p class="docText">As we will see, there are often many ways of dealing with the same numbers. Various countries have adopted differing accounting conventions. As a result, for example (picking a company at random), the Royal Bank of Scotland’s net profit in the first half of 2002 was well over US$500 million higher under the US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP – note the jargon) than under the UK’s GAAP. Who would have thought that by crossing the Atlantic you could magic up half a billion in six months? Of course, there is no sorcery. It is all down to bookkeeping entries.</p>
				<a id="ch02note05"></a><div class="docNote">
					<p class="docText">The origin of modern accounting can perhaps be traced to double entry accounting used by Venetian merchants in the 1200s. Luca Pacioli, a Franciscan monk, took the trouble to document the system thoroughly in a paper dated 1494; and Gutenberg’s printing press helped ensure that the concept spread rapidly through Europe to Britain – and thence to the world at large.</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">In just about every country, regulators impose rules or guidelines governing the way that financial reports are produced. Mostly, the watchdogs also require these reports to be published. It is interesting to examine the way that accounting has evolved, and why. Some examples of the motivating factors, and the results, will make this clear.</p>
				<a id="ch02lev3sec1"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EUKAE" class="docSection3Title">The stage of economic development</h5>
					<ul><li><p class="docList">Countries such as the US, Japan and many in western Europe (which have large and multifaceted corporations with widespread public ownership) have developed complex accounting structures with detailed requirements for the disclosure of information.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Less-developed economies such as many in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, particularly where company ownership is more closed, have less complex accounting rules with more relaxed disclosure requirements.</p></li></ul>
				
				<a id="ch02lev3sec2"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EILAE" class="docSection3Title">The type of economic system</h5>
					<ul><li><p class="docList"><a id="iddle1266"></a><a id="iddle1669"></a><a id="iddle1720"></a><a id="iddle2170"></a>Laissez-faire, common law countries, such as the UK, allowed the private sector to develop accounting principles to suit the needs of joint-stock companies and their financiers.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Where laws are codified, as in western Europe, governments have attempted to document standard accounting rules which apply uniformly across all types of business. These rules may be tax based (France, Spain), legalistic (Germany) or socialistic (Sweden).</p></li><li><p class="docList">Communist states such as those in the former Soviet bloc were concerned with measuring production quotas rather than profit, and with state ownership rather than the interests of shareholders.</p></li></ul>
				
				<a id="ch02lev3sec3"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EYMAE" class="docSection3Title">The rate of inflation</h5>
					<ul><li><p class="docList">High-inflation countries in Latin America have adopted current cost rather than historic cost accounting (discussed in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch18.html#ch18">Chapter 18</a>, p. <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch18lev1sec3.html#ch18lev3sec11">275</a>).</p></li></ul>
				
				<a id="ch02lev3sec4"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EXNAE" class="docSection3Title">Spheres of influence</h5>
					<ul><li><p class="docList">The British carried their accounting system throughout their former Empire, which at its peak covered more than 25% of the world’s land area and people – and has included North America, Australia, New Zealand, India, parts of the Middle East, Atlantic and Pacific Islands, the south-east Asian power houses of Singapore and Hong Kong, and countless other places too numerous to list here. British investments in North American railways also helped to cement British accounting in the US in its postcolonial period.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Other colonial trends had similar effects: Dutch accounting was exported to South Africa and Indonesia, and Spain’s to Latin America.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Accounting in Japan was influenced by the country’s close ties with Germany early in the last century, then by the US after the Second World War.</p></li><li><p class="docList">The US influenced neighbouring Canada and Mexico, and its former colony, the Philippines.</p></li><li><p class="docList">In the last few decades, the economic dominance of the US carried its accounting practices to most corners of the map.</p></li></ul>
				
				<a id="ch02lev3sec5"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EUOAE" class="docSection3Title">Internationalization</h5>
					<p class="docText">And there, in a nutshell, you have a rough and ready overview of how accounting spread around the globe. Except that it is still evolving. The growth of multinational corporations, the internationalization of capital markets and the general trend to globalization has led to pressures for unification of international accounting standards. You can see the logic. If everyone plays by the same rules, it will be easier to operate, invest and raise capital in world markets. It does not take too much thought to see that global convergence would be tricky, but the lesser goal of harmonization is easier to achieve.</p>

It is a private-sector body based in London and is largely sponsored by the accounting profession. Its goal is to promote worldwide <span class="docEmphasis">convergence on a single set of high-quality, understandable and enforceable global accounting standards</span>. It is doing pretty well so far. Around 100 countries either allow or <span class="docEmphasis">require</span> domestic companies to prepare their accounts using the IASB’s standards. For example, European Union (EU) regulations required all EU listed companies to produce consolidated financial statements under International Accounting Standards (IAS) by 2005 (with the adoption of some clauses deferred until 2007), and some countries (including Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Singapore) have adopted the IASs as their own national standards almost word for word. Even mighty Uncle Sam seems to be bowing to pressure; the US domestic accounting standards board and IASB are working towards convergence of their standards by 2008.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EKRAE" class="docSection2Title">OOA – an overload of acronyms</h4>
				<p class="docText">When it comes to accounting standards, your Finance Director will rattle off all manner of AMAEs (acronyms meaningless to anyone else). To give you a fighting chance of understanding this beanie-speak, <a class="docLink" href="#ch02fig02">Fig. 2.2</a> outlines standards-setting in the US, UK and internationally. It is, after all, odds on that you are working in a country with beanie rules influenced by one of these two English-speaking nations. I will not labour the point, but note the rule-making roles of FASB (pronounced fas-bee) in the US and the FRC/ASB in the UK. These bodies, and others similar to them around the world, will coexist with the International Accounting Standards Board for the foreseeable future.</p>

To save you counting (acronyms explained in <a class="docLink" href="#ch02fig02">Fig. 2.2</a>), it has 31 APB Opinions, over 150 FASB Statements, dozens of Interpretations, Statements of Position and Accounting Guides issued by the ACIPA, and goodness knows what else.</p>
					<p class="docText">With all these rules, you would expect US beanies to be the best behaved in the world. As it is, this lawyer-dominated society has found ways to follow the rules while pulling the wool over our eyes. Some very devious ways that the books were cooked came to light in 2002. They are discussed in various places in this book. These discoveries led to the hastily introduced Corporate Responsibility Act (Sarbanes-Oxley) in mid-2002, which established stronger penalties for corporate malfeasance, an SEC-controlled oversight board for the accounting industry and new rules for corporate executives and directors.</p>
					<a id="ch02note07"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">In on the Act</p>
						<p class="docText">In the US, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 require the filing of certain financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – such as Forms 10-Q (quarterly) and 10-K (annually – I expect there is a reason for designating it K). There is a full list of these forms on this book’s website.</p>
					</div><br/>
					<p class="docText">In contrast to the US, there are only about 30 accounting standards in the UK (and one Reporting Standard – see p. <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch17lev1sec4.html#ch17lev1sec4">254</a>), and there are more relaxed rules for private limited companies. The overriding principle, enshrined in the 1985 Companies Act, is that accounts should give a <span class="docEmphasis">true and fair view</span> of a corporation’s financial position. It is much harder to cheat if you have to comply with this sort of moral code (although, to be fair to all concerned, I have to say that the UK has had its own share of corporate accounting scandals).</p>
					<p class="docText">Consequently, the International Accounting Standards Board has stated categorically that it does not intend to follow the over-regulated US model. We all held our breath for a while, but in October 2002 the US <span class="docEmphasis">seemed</span> to agree to implement IAS by 2005. It didn’t. But it is working with the IASB to achieve convergence in 2008 (or later).</p>

						</td><td valign="top"><p class="docText">Multinationals (corporations operating or raising finance in more than one country) often have to prepare several sets of accounts – one for each country’s GAAP. For example, software giant Infosys formally reported its financial statements under the accounting principles of (alphabetically) Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, the UK and the US. As International Accounting Standards become accepted, the job of producing and interpreting financial reports is becoming greatly simplified. I have to say, though, that it does seem something of a miracle that everybody is working together so well. If only politics were as friendly as accounting.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/>
