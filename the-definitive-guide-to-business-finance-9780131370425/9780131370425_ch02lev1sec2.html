			<p class="docText">There is no escaping it. Managers have to deal with numbers. The little digits come at you from all angles. They bubble up from below – your subordinates continuously bombard you with data. They are fired in sideways. You will receive all manner of potentially exciting or troubling figures from marketing and sales, production, research and development and, especially, accounting and finance. They drop in from above, often uninvited, in missives and instructions. You will receive them from customers, suppliers, business partners, bankers, brokers and other well-meaning outsiders. You will find them in every newspaper, magazine and journal. You will even hear them on broadcast media – in programming apparently intended for six-year-olds which fills the short gaps between endless, mindless adverts, themselves full of useful facts, such as nine out of ten cats love Whiskers.</p>
			<a id="ch02note01"></a><div class="docNote">
				<p class="docText">Managers have been dealing with numbers since time immemorial. The earliest known writing is a 5,500-year-old inscription on pottery vessels found in the Indus Valley – the script was probably a bookkeeping entry.</p>
				<p class="docText">Almost concurrently, in the overall scheme of things, the Mesopotamians were keeping written accounting records and running banks. And recently, archaeologists have concluded that the majority of Egyptian hieroglyphs on clay tablets from the same era are tax records. Now there’s a thought.</p>
			</div><br/>
			<p class="docText">There is no getting away from the fact that there is no getting away from numbers. Moreover, once you have them in your possession, you have to do something useful with them. You have to turn chaos into order, data into information. You will analyse, interpret, review and criticize (this last one is fun). And then you will make a decision, prepare a report, present to your colleagues or a committee, argue a case, delegate, or take some other action based on the numbers.</p>
			<p class="docText">This is not something to take lightly. It can make or break your career. It can even ruin your marriage. Directors who intentionally or accidentally mislead can be personally liable. Pop a number in the wrong place in the balance sheet and you could end up in jail, as demonstrated in numerous corporate scandals in 2002 – more on this fascinating matter later.</p>
			<p class="docText">The central theme in this book, as you may have guessed from its lengthy title, is <span class="docEmphasis">what smart managers do with the numbers</span>. Together, you and I will see how to make short work of all these sources and uses of numbers. Or, to put it another way, how to manage better using the numbers. We will set the ball rolling in this chapter.</p>
			<a id="ch02lev2sec4"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EKFAE" class="docSection2Title">Safety in numbers</h4>
				<p class="docText">Many people are frightened of figures. There is no need to be. If you have ever argued over whether a given colour was green or blue, or if a rice allowance should be replaced with a cash payment (we are talking Asia-Pacific here), you will know that some issues have no easy answer. Yet numbers adhere obligingly to the laws of logic. One apple plus one apple is unquestionably two apples.</p>
				<a id="ch02note02"></a><div class="docNote">
					<p class="docText">Ancient shoppers and traders tried using various objects as money, including cattle, stones, shells, miniature metal tools, copper rings and iron bars. Most endearingly, perhaps, cocoa beans were used as money in pre-Columbian Mexico.</p>
					<p class="docText">Incidentally, the first true coins seem to have been in use in Asia Minor and China about 2,700 years ago.</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">Moreover, you do not have to have a mathematics chip implanted in your brain in order to deal with numbers. You can always use a calculator, as demonstrated amply in fast-food establishments every time you do tricky stuff such as using a $10 note to pay for a $4.99 Big Burger with fries.</p>
				<a id="ch02note03"></a><div class="docNote">
					<p class="docText">Accounting and finance are inextricably linked. The former being perhaps more concerned with record keeping and the latter with money matters in general. To save a few words here and there, references to accounting in this book usually mean accounting and finance unless otherwise indicated.</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">Indeed, in order to have an adequate mastery over the numbers, you need nothing more than a modicum of common sense, the ability to coexist with everyday office equipment, and a willingness to master a few straightforward and logical methods and procedures. It is well worth the effort. It will elevate you to the status of one of the Big Five in the UN Security Council. You will not necessarily be able to make things happen, but you will certainly have the power of veto in management meetings. Who will be able to argue with you if you can demonstrate with a few undisputable figures that Kim’s project is not financially viable?</p>
				<p class="docText">Of course, the power of numbers goes much further than this. With a reasonable command of the figures, you will be able to manage more effectively and efficiently, make better decisions, produce stunning reports, be a better communicator and at least hold your own in difficult meetings. There is, indeed, safety in numbers.</p>
				<p class="docText">By the way, I found that replacing the rice allowance with cash in hand was a bad idea. At first it was well received and easy to administer. It meant more spending power for the staff and no more humping sacks of food around. Yet, within months, the employees were complaining that it was unfair that they did not have a rice allowance while their friends did. The rationality underpinning numerical analysis is not found everywhere. That is where your other management skills are needed.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0ENGAE" class="docSection2Title">Just enough and no more</h4>
				<p class="docText">You will meet numbers cloaked in various guises:</p>
				<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Frequently they will be raw and unadorned, as in: ‘my best programmer writes 20 lines of code a day’ (the industry average is between eight and 20 lines, honestly) or ‘output rose by 101 units’.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Sometimes the figures have been squeezed through an analytical process: ‘there is a one in eight chance that the next spangle out of the box will be red’ or ‘a 10% increase in advertising spending will boost sales by 1.2%’.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">More often than not, the data will be dressed up with a dollar or other currency sign in financial amounts such as ‘sales exceeded $23 million in March’.</p></div></li></ol></div>
				<p class="docText">Generalizing a touch, these examples of digit dress-sense are known grandly as numerical methods, quantitative analysis and financial analysis (respectively). Do not let that worry you. Each one is straightforward enough in its own way.</p>
				<p class="docText">The financial figures are the most pervasive because, after all, businesses and probably your performance are usually measured in beans: net profit, cash flow, assets, share price, etc. Consequently, we will touch on all three of these numerical techniques, but with a special focus on finance. Frankly, you have to be competent with the beans, but you can get by with a little less of the statistical skills.</p>
				<p class="docText">With just a few hundred pages in this slim book, it is going to be necessary to concentrate on the things which, to borrow a phrase, give the biggest bang for the buck. I will try to focus on practical issues, without meandering down academic side routes. We might have to go quite fast to complete our journey, but you can pull off into a lay-by and take a break whenever you wish.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EFIAE" class="docSection2Title">Places to meet numbers</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1766"></a><a id="iddle1822"></a>This is an easy bit. I want to tell you what is not in this chapter. It seems to me that it is useful to outline some of the places where you will meet numbers, so you know what to look out for as we travel together. A handful of examples follow. These are useful things to think about as you read the rest of this book.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Dealing with beanies.</span> How do you deal with your chief financial officer, finance director, financial controller, financial managers, external accountants, internal and external auditors, commercial bankers, investment bankers, etc? Are they different from other professionals?</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Meetings about numbers.</span> How do you prepare for and handle such meetings? They include: kick off, review and approval meetings for the annual budget exercise, sales forecasts, financial planning, etc.; monthly, quarterly and annual reviews of budget/sales/financial performance (actual against forecast); financial post-mortems; getting approval for new projects and business units; funding, borrowing, raising equity, initial public offerings (IPOs), annual shareholders meetings, pre-audit planning, post-audit reviews, investment reviews, and, well, I could go on but I guess you get the point.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">When you are in the spotlight and on the defensive.</span> What questions will you be asked, and how do you answer? Where will they pick holes in your analysis and shoot you down? How do you get buy-in? How can you defend your assumptions, projections and forecasts? How can you allocate responsibility and pass the buck legitimately?</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">When you are in the spotlight and on the attack.</span> What questions should you ask and what answers could you expect? Where do you look for holes and flaws in the numbers shown to you? How should you question forecasts? How do you find fixes – where other managers have used bookkeeping trickery (capitalizing <a id="iddle1038"></a><a id="iddle1267"></a><a id="iddle1379"></a>costs, fiddling depreciation and amortization, provisions, cheating with timing, off-balance sheet items) or real-world trickery (skimping on maintenance, using sub-contractors, leases, etc.)?</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Re-jigging the numbers.</span> What do you do when the numbers are off-target before you start or during the year? How can you revise your forecasts, cut costs, boost revenues, and get to a better bottom line?</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Financial reporting.</span> What do you want from your managers? What do you have to send upwards? How can you set up reporting procedures, make them work, get value from financial reports, and generally manage better?</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Better decision-making.</span> How profitable is your business? Which product lines are most profitable? Which business units are most vulnerable? What indicators of operating efficiency, liquidity, debt, and investment should you track? How do you value and choose between projects, estimate net present value and the internal rate of return, use activity-based costing, calculate return on investment, manage inventory, receivables and payables, and so on?</p>
