			<p class="docText">The following is not exhaustive, but it identifies the major sources of finance. Debt and equity are discussed in more detail in a moment.</p>
			<a id="ch19lev2sec4"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EOJCI" class="docSection2Title">Sources of short-term finance</h4>
				<p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_435">Trade credit</a></b> from suppliers and trade partners. This helps finance inventory, either on terms (e.g. 90 days to pay) or a consignment basis (you pay the supplier only when you sell the goods).</p>
				<p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_187">Factoring.</a></b> This is where you sell your invoices at a discount (maybe 90% of face value or less) and the factoring company takes full responsibility for collecting from <a id="iddle1135"></a><a id="iddle1150"></a><a id="iddle1290"></a><a id="iddle1366"></a><a id="iddle1368"></a><a id="iddle1434"></a><a id="iddle1498"></a><a id="iddle1501"></a><a id="iddle1505"></a><a id="iddle1518"></a><a id="iddle1524"></a><a id="iddle1525"></a><a id="iddle1528"></a><a id="iddle1529"></a><a id="iddle1643"></a><a id="iddle1718"></a><a id="iddle1738"></a><a id="iddle1744"></a><a id="iddle1765"></a><a id="iddle2020"></a>your client. Factoring unlocks value from your invoices, but can be expensive and might damage your relationship with your customers if the factoring company is heavy handed. Note that accepting even a 5% discount on invoices which would normally be collected within 30 days amounts to paying 80% per annum interest.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Bank overdrafts or loans.</span> These can be very flexible, although banks usually require security over specific assets – occasionally invoices or inventory but often more-tangible plant, property or equipment.</p>
				<a id="ch19note03"></a><div class="docNote">
					<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Loans</span> might be provided by banks, finance or credit companies, or even private investors. Government and some non-government agencies, and private foundations may also offer loans, research grants, and other endowments.</p>
					<p class="docText">Look to government agencies for export credit guarantees. See also the notes on foreign trade finance in the next chapter.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EMPCI" class="docSection2Title">Medium-term finance</h4>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Leasing.</span> This is where you make staged payments for the purchase or rent of plant, property or equipment. Recall the difference between operating and finance leases (<a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</a>).</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Hire purchase.</span> This is broadly similar to leasing. A finance company buys an asset, hires it to you for a monthly fee, and transfers ownership to you at the end of the contract.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Medium-term loans</span> are usually for a specific purpose, over a fixed period, with a pre-determined rate of interest and, usually, secured against plant or property.</p>
			
			<a id="ch19lev2sec6"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0ERQCI" class="docSection2Title">Long-term finance</h4>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Long-term loans.</span> These are similar to medium-term loans, but probably secured by a mortgage over land and property.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Corporate bonds</span> or <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_277">loan stock</a></b>. This is borrowing by a company, where the <span class="docEmphasis">paper</span> is traded on secondary financial markets, at a fixed interest rate (<i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_113">coupon</a></i>) and with fixed repayment. Such borrowing may be secured against specific assets – a <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_135">debenture</a></i> is an unsecured bond.</p>
				<a id="ch19note04"></a><div class="docNote">
					<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Employee share ownership plans</span> can provide an efficient source of finance which helps build employee commitment: employees buy shares for cash or by deduction from their salaries: the company contributes in shares. Either way the money stays in the family. Whether options should be set against profit or carried on the balance sheet was a hot regulatory topic at the start of 2003.</p>

				<p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_178">Equity</a></b>. Shares issued by a company; not repayable. Discussed below.</p>
