			<p class="docText">The title of this book contains the secret: Success in business finance comes from more than just looking after the cents, pence or whatever. It’s about how you manage the numbers. All of them. Even the ones without currency symbols. Everything feeds through to the financial bottom line somehow or other, sooner or later. Accordingly, the aim of this book is to reveal <span class="docEmphasis">what smart managers do with the numbers</span>.</p>
			<p class="docText">We are about to embark on an enjoyable (trust me on this) journey through the realm where managers and numbers meet or, perhaps, collide. It depends how you feel about figures. This book is intended primarily for non-financial managers and entrepreneurs. It is a meld of finance and investment; financial, management and cost accounting; economics; forecasting; statistics; quantitative analysis and other numerical techniques. But do not let that put you off. No prior specialist knowledge is required. Yet, by the time you reach the end of the book you should be able to produce solid forecasts and financials, present and defend them even in hostile environments, and do some pretty snappy analysis of numbers provided by your colleagues and competitors. Indeed, the book should help you to hold your own when dealing with any professional number crunchers, including accountants, bankers and your chief financial officer. Never again risk intimidation or being snowed under by the numbers, and win some tough arguments.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EJCAE" class="docSection2Title">Who are you travelling with?</h4>
				<p class="docText">Most people who read this book are non-financial managers – or soon-to-be managers – in corporations and non-profit organizations. Some readers are entrepreneurs running their own businesses. Students of business studies and finance use it as an introductory text. We even have some bean counters turning the pages.</p>

					</td><td valign="top"><p class="docText">Accountants are frequently known as bean counters, or beanies, perhaps because beans are sometimes used as a simile for money. Indeed, cocoa beans were used as cash in pre-Columbian Mexico, and some early metallic coins were bean shaped. However, the origin of the term bean counter probably relates to being tight-fisted and counting the last bean in a grocery store (see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>). Given the way that accountants can manipulate numbers, it seems that ‘dough kneaders’ might also be a good tag for them.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EPDAE" class="docSection2Title">Batteries (more or less) included</h4>
				<p class="docText">Let me reiterate that no special knowledge is required to read this book. I am going to assume that you are a bit of a muppet (one up from a dummy) when it comes to numbers, finance and computers. This is not meant to be an insult. You must be competent at what you do, or you would not be reading a Financial Times Prentice Hall book. I will just start from scratch with these numbers things and try to explain it all as we go along. You can skip over the material that you already know or use it as a refresher for things that you have forgotten.</p>
				<p class="docText">You do not necessarily have to have a personal computer (PC), but they make doing the numbers so easy that you ought at least to arrange access to one. You will soon see how great they are as management tools. If you need convincing, go to an Internet café in a town where no one knows you and have a play with Microsoft Word and Excel – after you have taken a look at <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
				<p class="docText">Incidentally, I fibbed a little when I said that I would start from scratch. I have to assume that you can at least turn on a PC, although not necessarily do much more. It will be ideal if you know how to use MS Word to write and print memos or letters. There is not room in this book to digress into the great mysteries of computing, so we will job through the essentials at a rapid pace. Chief executives and other real computer beginners are welcome to download the supplementary introductory material from the website accompanying this book (see p. <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch01lev1sec3.html#ch01lev1sec3">7</a>).</p>
				<p class="docText">Other than being able to power on a PC, if you can add up and subtract (with or without a calculator), and if you have a rough idea what a bank is, you’ll be fine.</p>
			
			<a id="ch01lev2sec7"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EPEAE" class="docSection2Title">How simple is simplified?</h4>
				<p class="docText">We (you and I together) have already established that you are not stupid. Accordingly, I am not going to insult your intelligence by giving you a superficial overview which will leave you vulnerable. We are going to discuss the financials in some detail so that you are ready to do battle with financial professionals. Accordingly, this book has a simple approach but it is not over-simplified. We will tackle some heavyweight topics, but I will try not to bog you down with unnecessary details. We are going to be highly focused on getting results – doing the numbers and making the right decisions based on the numbers.</p>

					</td><td valign="top"><h2 class="docSidebarTitle">No royal we’s</h2><p class="docText">Incidentally, as I write I have a picture of you in my mind. If I say that we are going to do something, I mean you and I together. There are no royal we’s in this book.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>
			
			<a id="ch01lev2sec8"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EQFAE" class="docSection2Title">I’m on your side</h4>
				<p class="docText">I want you to know before we start that I am completely on your side. I am not a bean counter. I am a manager just like you and I talk your language. I had to start somewhere – close to the bottom actually – and I remember the pain of learning this stuff from dull textbooks and kindly bean counters. But I did learn it. I also picked up many useful wrinkles along the way and I retain some healthy scepticism about much of this. I hope that my sense of humour has not been beaten out of me completely, and will try to pass on some of my knowledge while making it fun for you at the same time. No, really, there is no reason why doing the numbers cannot be entertaining and interesting.</p>
			
			<a id="ch01lev2sec9"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0E2FAE" class="docSection2Title">Financial law and lore from the sharp end</h4>
				<p class="docText">Where did I pick up all this beanie stuff? In the early days of my career I was an analyst with investment banks – crawling over financials, looking for value and for danger signs – and a professionally qualified member of the London Stock Exchange. Later, I was secretary to a bank’s assets and liabilities committee, chief economist, adviser to a bank’s chairman, and a general manager of an international commercial bank. Along the way, I also worked at HM Treasury (the British finance ministry) where I was involved with world economic reporting, monetary policy and exchange rates, national public spending, cash controls, and corporate taxation. You come to see and do quite a lot of numbers in those positions. A good chunk of the work was forecasting, analysing, interpreting and troubleshooting.</p>
				<p class="docText">Moreover, even if banking and finance is one step removed from the oily reality of the real world, I had to prepare my own budgets and business plans just the same as any other manager. I was also governor and treasurer of a preparatory school for which I prepared financial plans to reverse a decade of losses. And for the past 10 years I have been running and directing multinational businesses, preparing feasibility studies, business plans, budgets and financials – and dealing with officials, auditors and accountants in a score of different jurisdictions around the world. Many of these businesses are in the new high-tech economy where doing the numbers is similar to doing them in the old economy, except that they plunge faster.</p>
				<p class="docText">Also, back in about 1980, I designed and programmed one of the world’s first PC-based spreadsheets. I have been a heavyweight user of number-crunching software ever since then. My interests include running a technology company and, for what it is worth, I am Microsoft certified. I provide corporate training in finance and technology related issues.</p>
				<p class="docText">One more thing. Working in sometimes very large corporations I have been well-exposed to the pleasures of corporate backstabbing and politics. Regrettably, I have seen executives fiddling the books, and entrepreneurs who ran off with the petty cash. Well, one of them emptied the bank account actually. As a result, I think I understand the environment in which you work. But enough of this. We need to consider our action plan.</p>
