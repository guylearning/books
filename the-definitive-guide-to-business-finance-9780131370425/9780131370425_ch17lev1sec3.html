				<p class="docText">The main aim of public reporting was – and still is – to keep shareholders informed. However, corporate bosses soon realized that this obligation provided an excellent public relations opportunity. <span class="docEmphasis">Any publicity is good publicity</span>. Annual financial reports grew into weighty glossy brochures containing photographs of the smiling CEO, some meaningless blurb, and – tucked away at the back almost as an afterthought – the financials. Then the regulators started piling on rules and turning discretionary pitches into mandatory statements and certifications. Today, annual reports can be monsters. Many companies now send a lower-cost financial report to shareholders who do not ask for more. If you are looking at a company in depth, make sure you have the all-singing-all-dancing glossy report.</p>
			
			<a id="ch17lev2sec5"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EE4BI" class="docSection2Title">Reading annual reports</h4>
				<p class="docText">Publication of an annual report marks the peak of a corporation’s financial results cycle, combining mandatory financial statements with glossy public relations and marketing hype. The annual report is usually the most comprehensive document relating to the financials, but it is not necessarily the be all and end all. For example, in the US, reports submitted to the SEC contain information, such as biographies of directors, which you do not usually find in annual reports.</p>
				<p class="docText">The best way to understand annual reports is to browse through a few. You can download some examples by visiting this book’s website. You do not have to read them cover to cover. A quick scan of some reports online will be instructive. When you come to detailed study of an annual report, you may find that it is useful to start with the auditor’s report, primarily to establish the regulatory reporting basis for the accounts and the auditor’s opinion. Glance over the financials, read the notes to the financials, work outwards from there, and then return to analyse the financials in detail. The main sections that may be included are as follows.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Chairman’s statement.</span> I could tell you now what it will say, even without knowing the company. Should be read with a cynical eye.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">President/CEO/MD’s report.</span> This is usually more detailed than the chairman’s statement but this is as much as I am prepared to say.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Review of the year.</span> Probably written by the marketing department. Most, if not all, of the information will already be public knowledge by the time you see it. If this is <a id="iddle1097"></a><a id="iddle1405"></a><a id="iddle1815"></a><a id="iddle1954"></a><a id="iddle1978"></a>your first real brush with the business, it might give you a useful overview of its more successful operations and perhaps its future plans. Given that the review is not required by regulators, do not expect it to be forthcoming about skeletons in the closet.</p>
				<a id="ch17note02"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">EBRs, OFRs, or just the truth?</p>
					<p class="docText">After more than a decade of development in the UK, mandatory reporting requirements for OFRs were finally included in the 2005 Companies Act. Yet, in a startling U-turn, the provision was repealed within days of the Act becoming law, and replaced with a watered-down requirement for an EBR. The UK Accounting Standards Board’s brand new <span class="docEmphStrong">Reporting Standard No. 1</span> had to be downgraded to a 69-page (yes, 69-page) recommendation of what should be in a voluntary OFR. Meanwhile, the IASB is working on its own mandatory regulation of management reporting. Watch this space.</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Directors’ report.</span> A more formal, written report, this may contain a brief overview of the financials. Look for any disclosures or useful supplemental information. Increasingly, such commentary may include information required by regulators, such as that outlined under the next two headings.</p>
				<p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_176">Enhanced business review (EBR)</a></b>. UK legislation requires an EBR – a comprehensive analysis of the development and performance of the business during the reporting year, details of the position of the company at the end of the year, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company. There are some exemptions for small businesses, while larger companies must also include key performance indicators (KPIs – see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch18.html#ch18">Chapters 18</a> and <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">19</a>, and the quote on p. <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch22lev1sec2.html#ch22sb02">342</a>) used by the company, such as market share, production costs per unit, retail sales per square foot, and, where appropriate, non-financial KPIs (relating to employees and environmental matters, etc.).</p>
				<p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_311">Operating and financial review (OFR).</a></b> An enhanced EBR, this may include more detailed information and analysis of past performance and the future outlook – see inset.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Auditor’s report.</span> This indicates the scope of the audit, the basis of the accounts (e.g. US GAAP) and, we hope, that the financial statements were found to comply with reporting regulations; that – in the words of the UK Companies Act – they give a <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_448">true and fair view</a></i> of the state of affairs of the company. When something wobbly is unearthed during the audit, the auditor’s report will <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_361">qualify</a></i> the financial statements with suitable warnings. A <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_361">qualification</a></i> is perhaps reassuring, because you can be sure something will be done about the issues raised. The sceptics would say that <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_453">unqualified</a></i> reports are a worry because there might be something wrong that has not yet come to light. I have not checked them all, but I think that there were unqualified clean audits before all of the recent corporate accounting scandals (WorldCom, Enron, etc.).</p>

				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Corporate governance statement.</span> <a id="iddle1292"></a><a id="iddle1553"></a><a id="iddle1559"></a><a id="iddle1796"></a>This is a new written report, prompted by various financial scandals. It essentially makes the directors put their hands on their hearts and confirm that they run the company properly, exercise prudence, and so on. Well, as long as they say they do I suppose it is all right. Such statements are often interesting for students who want to better understand the formal mechanics of running a business.</p>
				<p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_199">Financial statements</a></b>. Financials at last. I will come back to these in a moment. They include:</p>

				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Notes to the financial statements</span>. Always worth reading, this is the most interesting part, comprising a few pages of small print with various notes and required disclosures. In many reports it will contain some of the information listed above, under <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_199">financial statements</a></i>. International Accounting Standard 1 covering the presentation of financial statements was amended in 2003. It now requires that the notes should contain information about the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimating uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to recorded assets and liabilities within the next financial year.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Highlights.</span> One other table you might find is a five-year summary of key financial indicators – sales, operating profit, net assets, etc. The table will look similar to <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch17lev1sec4.html#ch17fig01">Fig. 17.1</a>, except that the rows will be captioned differently. This may be outside of the regulated sections, and the numbers might not be directly comparable with the latest financials. Check the basis for the numbers (e.g. which measure of profit). Those selected will be as flattering as possible.</p>
