			<h3 class="docSection1Title">How managers assess costs</h3>
			<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1001"></a><a id="iddle1032"></a><a id="iddle1298"></a><a id="iddle1300"></a>So far, we have discussed mainly the accountants’ concept of cost allocation – with some lip service to economists. However, one of the most valuable assessments you can make is a review of costs by product or service. And for each item, you also need a breakdown by activity – development, production, sales, etc. You can then set these figures against revenues by product to see how your lines really stack up.</p>
			<p class="docText">But how? Traditional cost accounting falls down in some areas. Its approach to <span class="docEmphasis">direct</span> product costs is fine, but it then assumes that <span class="docEmphasis">indirect</span> costs are allocated to products in some arbitrary way. The most usual method is to say that this product generates 20% of our revenue so we will assume that it <span class="docEmphasis">absorbs</span> 20% of our overheads. This is known as <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_003">absorption costing</a></i>. Clearly it is rather nonsensical. There may be minimial or huge overheads associated with one product – and completely the opposite situation with another. A better approach is <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_020">activity-based costing</a></i> – where you try to identify which overheads are associated with which activities. But even this falls flat on its face due to arbitrary inventory and depreciation valuations.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0E6SAI" class="docSection2Title">Common-sense costing</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1265"></a><a id="iddle1304"></a><a id="iddle1753"></a><a id="iddle1894"></a>For management purposes, there is no better way to consider costs than to aggressively re-assess the financials, re-estimate inventory and fixed asset accounting, and apply logic and common sense to the allocation of costs.</p>
				<p class="docText">Basically, try to make an accurate economic assessment of costs and benefits of your fixed assets, and the real cost of inventory. Use these figures in your management analysis in place of the bean counter’s figures. Then take all of your spending and revenues – including bad debts, interest and tax – and try to allocate each dollar to a specific product. Remember to adjust these figures to get at the underlying picture. For example, if there were large bad debts relating to one product, and you honestly assess that there were special circumstances which will not be repeated, do not include all of the debts as costs of the product. You will build big spreadsheets based on a great deal of management judgement. But you will gain a good understanding of how each product shapes up.</p>
				<p class="docText">At the end of the exercise, you want a list of products showing the profit from each one (sales less costs) and the margins (sales divided by costs). You will now see which product really does contribute most to your bottom line in cash terms, and which is most profitable in terms of the profit margin. You need to ask why these figures are as they are. For example, why do we make such a big margin on this product, but it only generates a small part of our total revenue? Why does this product contribute so much revenue but at such a small margin? Is there anything special about production, purchasing or sales techniques for the products with big margins which could be applied elsewhere? Can we concentrate on high-margin products and drop some with low margins? And so on.</p>
