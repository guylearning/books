			<p class="docText">The joint stock companies formed to finance seafaring adventures in the 1500s were such a success (not least because of the vast riches plundered by buccaneers) that the concept was rapidly extended to more mundane ventures. The principle is simple. When a large number of investors contribute capital, their individual risk is spread, the company receives the finance it needs, but the investors still share the rewards. These <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_399">shareholders</a></i> are actually part owners of the company, but they delegate the day-to-day running of the business to the directors. Shareholders with large blocks of shares, or acting in collusion with other investors, exercise influence or control through their ability to hire and fire directors – which at least ensures that captains of industry keep looking over their shoulders.</p>
			<p class="docText">There is no statutory obligation for a company to distribute profits (as dividends). Moreover, the company does not have to repay the capital unless it ceases operations. If this does happen, shareholders have (only) the pickings after assets have been sold, and the employees and debtors have been paid off. Shareholders <span class="docEmphasis">can</span> unlock their investment by selling their shares in the secondary stock markets, but the price they will receive depends only on what someone else is prepared to pay. These secondary transactions do not affect the company’s finances directly, except that the directors are under constant pressure to perform well so that the share price rises. Indeed, ordinary investors usually buy shares for the expected increase in value (the capital gain), rather than the dividends.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EBMCI" class="docSection2Title">Why are share prices important?</h4>
				<p class="docText">If you purchased 100% of a company’s shares, you would own it outright. Accordingly, the share price (multiplied by the number of its shares) indicates the market value of a company – its <span class="docEmphasis">market capitalization</span>. Of course, you would be hard pushed to buy the company for that price, because as soon as other investors saw you buying up the share capital they would guess what was going on and try to get in on the action.</p>
			
			<a id="ch19lev2sec9"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EPMCI" class="docSection2Title">What determines share prices?</h4>
				<a id="ch19note07"></a><div class="docNote">
					<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1055"></a><a id="iddle1430"></a><a id="iddle1663"></a><a id="iddle2098"></a><a id="iddle2122"></a>In mid-2001, Irish biotech giant Elan’s share price plummeted by 52% in one day – triggered by rumours, later confirmed, of dubious accounting techniques. The most spectacular crash in Irish corporate history, it accounted for a 16% fall in the Irish ISEQ market index. The market capitalization of Elan fell from $22 bn to under $1 bn.</p>

				<p class="docText">How do investors decide what to pay for shares? All other things being equal, you would suppose that investors are buying into a going concern and that they want it to stay that way (but see <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_033">asset strippers</a></i>, below). If so, the price indicates the value that they put on the future stream of profits that the company is expected to generate. These profits, in turn, depend on many factors including the following <span class="docEmphasis">fundamentals:</span></p>
				<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The earning ability of the company’s net assets – both tangible (plant, property and equipment) and, possibly more important, intangible (patents, brands, position, reputation). This may bear little relationship to their book value, given the way that beanies do their sums (see especially <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch11.html#ch11">Chapters 11</a> and <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch13.html#ch13">13</a>).</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The ability of top management, although remember that they can always leave or be replaced.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">External conditions (the economy, competitors, technological change, etc.).</p></div></li></ol></div>
				<p class="docText">If there was no new information from the company for a period of time, the share price would still bump around due to changes in investors’ perceptions of external conditions. This is why the announcement of a smaller than expected increase in industrial production or a larger than predicted fall in employment can send stock markets tumbling. And, conversely, why surprise good news can make share prices surge.</p>
				<a id="ch19note08"></a><div class="docNote">
					<p class="docText">Incidentally, in case you are talking to investment bankers, the extent to which the price of a company’s shares move with the market is known as market or <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_425">systematic risk</a></b>. The way that a corporation’s performance affects its share price is known as <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_409">specific risk</a></b>.</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">With all this externally induced turbulence, how do you tell what is happening to the underlying price of a company’s shares? You compare it with similar corporations, the average for its sector (e.g. the retail companies share index), and the market as a whole (e.g. using market indices such as the S&amp;P 500 or the all-share index) – see this book’s website.</p>

					</td><td valign="top"><p class="docText">By the way, market psychology and even computer trading programs can move share prices significantly. Technical analysis tries to predict such movements. Its proponents claim that if share prices break some trend line, or form certain patterns (such as two small peaks around one big one – called a <span class="docEmphasis">head-and-shoulders</span>), the next major move can be forecast. Given that such events may cause technical analysts to shout <span class="docEmphasis">buy</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">sell</span> in unison, their prophesy might be little more than a self-fulfilling contribution to market sentiment. However, if it works for them, who am I to argue.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/>

					<h5 id="title-ID0E3QCI" class="docSection3Title">Unlisted but not unloved</h5>
					<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1056"></a><a id="iddle1664"></a><a id="iddle1737"></a><a id="iddle1832"></a><a id="iddle1878"></a><a id="iddle2099"></a><a id="iddle2179"></a>A company with shares trading on a recognized stock exchange is said to be <span class="docEmphasis">listed</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">quoted.</span> An <span class="docEmphasis">unlisted</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">unquoted</span> company will not have a published market-determined share price. How can you value such companies? The easy way is to estimate what the share price would be if the company was listed.</p>
					<p class="docText">The key is the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_342">price earnings ratio/multiple</a></i>, which is profit per share as a multiple of the share price. For example, many companies trade at a price earnings multiple of between 10 or 20. This implies that when you buy an ordinary share you are acquiring a stream of profits equivalent to 10 to 20 times the price you pay. Put another way, if net profit is a healthy $1 billion, this suggests a valuation of $10 billion to $20 billion. Technology companies, where present profits are taken perhaps oddly as a promise of exorbitantly higher earnings in the future, traded at outlandish price earnings ratios in excess of 600 during the dot-com boom which itself peaked in 2000.</p>
					<p class="docText">Accordingly, if you take the price earnings ratio of an appropriate listed company, and multiply it by the unlisted company’s net profit, you arrive at an estimate of the value of the unlisted company. For example, if you examine two or three similar companies and see that their average price earnings ratio is about 12, and your company’s net profit is $10 million, its value could be estimated at $120 million. If it happens that a similar company has been taken over recently, you might be able to use that as the model. Of course, you need to be careful about comparing like with like, but I know that I can leave that to your judgement.</p>
				
				<a id="ch19lev3sec4"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EITCI" class="docSection3Title">Other valuation techniques</h5>
					<p class="docText">There are other ways to value a company. Let me mention two.</p>
					<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Brew the beans.</span> One way is to project the net profit for, say, the next 10 or 20 years and work out the net present value at an appropriate discount rate. Net present value is discussed in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>. This might be especially relevant if you were considering acquiring a majority stake and putting in your own management.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Strip the assets.</span> Alternatively, you could perform your own calculation of net asset value. Essentially, you work through the balance sheet valuing each asset and liability at, say, its market price (as opposed to book value) and work out how much money you would have left (if any) if you closed down the company, sold its assets, and settled its debts. This is how asset strippers make their money. Of course, the assessment does not have to be an open-market valuation. You might be thinking about acquiring a company because you consider that its patents, brands or other assets would be much more valuable when combined with your own resources.</p></div></li></ol></div>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EUUCI" class="docSection2Title">Other issues about equity</h4>
				<p class="docText">To avoid confusion, let me highlight the distinction between <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_038">authorized</a></i>, <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_264">issued</a></i> and <span class="docEmphasis">paid (</span><i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_326">paid-in</a></i> or <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_327">paid-up</a></i>) capital.</p>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1098"></a><a id="iddle1264"></a><a id="iddle1699"></a><a id="iddle1821"></a><a id="iddle1836"></a><a id="iddle1837"></a><a id="iddle1863"></a><a id="iddle2022"></a><a id="iddle2100"></a><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_038">Authorized capital</a></b> indicates the maximum amount of shares that could be sold, and their book value. A company’s <span class="docEmphasis">memorandum and articles of association</span>, its <span class="docEmphasis">bylaws</span>, will identify its authorized capital. This could be specified as, say, 10 million ordinary shares of $1 each, meaning that the company can issue up to 10 million shares, at – wait for it – any price it chooses. If you were awake when we discussed balance sheets, you will recall that a company might sell its $1 shares at $1.50 each. In such a case, $1 would be recorded as paid-in capital and $0.50 as additional paid-in capital. Shares may never trade at their face value, or par value ($1 in this example), which is an arbitrary number. Shareholders can vote to change the structure and amount of a company’s authorized capital.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Issued.</span> A company might not issue all of its shares if, for example, it requires less capital than it could raise by selling all of its shares.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Paid.</span> A company might issue <span class="docEmphasis">partially-paid</span> shares. For example, if a $1 share was issued for 60 cents, its holder would have a liability to pay the remaining 40 cents on demand or on a predetermined date. An investor’s maximum liability as a shareholder is the par value of the shares held.</p>

					</td><td valign="top"><p class="docText">Note that many governments and licensing authorities stipulate minimum levels of paid-in capital, with the basic aim of protecting creditors. Specific industries (e.g. financial institutions) are often subject to special regulations, for similar reasons. Stock exchanges have more severe requirements for full listing. Business partners and associations may also have conditions. For example, travel agents cannot belong to their international association (IATA) unless their capital exceeds certain amounts.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>

					<h5 id="title-ID0EGZCI" class="docSection3Title">Stock splits</h5>
					<p class="docText">When the price of a traded stock rises too far, the directors might ask shareholders to approve a stock split to make the shares seem more appealing to new investors. A split is when the company, say, divides each share in half to double the number outstanding. For example, if a company has 10,000 shares issued, and each share is trading at $100, then after a 2-for-1 stock split, there will be 20,000 shares outstanding at $50 each. The total value of all shares, and each shareholder’s percentage of the total, remains unchanged. Stocks can split two for one, three for two, five for one, or any other creative combination.</p>

					<h5 id="title-ID0ERZCI" class="docSection3Title">Variations on a theme</h5>
					<a id="ch19note10"></a><div class="docNote">
						<p class="docText">International accounting standards require companies to classify as debt <span class="docEmphStrong">redeemable preference stock where redemption is mandatory</span>.</p>
					</div><br/>
					<p class="docText">The core of a company’s share capital will be <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_319">ordinary shares</a></i>, also known as <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_086">common stock</a></i>. Companies also issue <span class="docEmphasis">preferred stock</span> to encourage investment. Preferred stockholders may not receive dividends, but they have to be paid a preset amount of dividends for the period in full before ordinary shareholders can receive theirs. Moreover, if a company ceases trading and there are funds left to repay shareholders, preferred stockholders are paid off ahead <a id="iddle1094"></a><a id="iddle1288"></a><a id="iddle1354"></a><a id="iddle1369"></a><a id="iddle1371"></a><a id="iddle1416"></a><a id="iddle1506"></a><a id="iddle1508"></a><a id="iddle1511"></a><a id="iddle1771"></a>of ordinary shareholders. <span class="docEmphasis">Cumulative preferred stock holders</span> are also at the head of the queue for unpaid dividends for prior periods. Holders of <span class="docEmphasis">convertible preferred stock</span> can switch it into ordinary stock under predefined terms.</p>
					<p class="docText">Well, with all these benefits, you would expect that there was a catch. There are two. Preferred stock holders rarely have voting rights, which helps directors to sleep easier. And while there is usually a floor on dividends, there is also a ceiling. You have to give some benefits to ordinary shareholders.</p>
				
				<a id="ch19lev3sec7"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EF4CI" class="docSection3Title">Dividend policy</h5>
					<p class="docText">If there is one area where directors manage the numbers, it is with dividend policies. There are large variations between industry sectors and between companies. Commentators perceive that dividends are an indicator of the health of a business. This raises two issues for the board.</p>
					<p class="docText">First, should dividends be paid at all? For example, US tech firms have tended to retain cash for investment; their shareholders have taken profits as capital gains. Indeed, it is argued that tech firms who do pay dividends are admitting that they have used up their opportunities to reinvest for future growth. However, when Microsoft announced its first ever dividend in early 2003, the company justified this on the grounds that it no longer needed to retain cash to defend itself against antitrust allegations. Its also showed support for President Bush’s proposed tax relief on dividends. (Oh, and by the way, it meant that Chairman Bill Gates was to receive a cool $100 million in tax-free dividend income.)</p>
					<p class="docText">The second issue is that if dividends are being paid, the trend should be <span class="docEmphasis">smooth:</span> stable and, perhaps, growing. Announcement of cuts in dividends can be disastrous. For example, the share price of US telecoms giant AT&amp;T slumped from a high of $60 in 2002 to under $20 after the company announced an 83% reduction in its dividend payout as it tried to pare its $3 billion annual interest costs and $63 billion debt. (See also <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_161">dividend payout ratio</a></i>, below.)</p>
