			<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery.</span></p>
			<p class="docText">This quote from the classic novel David Copperfield by Charles Dickens says it all. It is the bottom line for you and me in our personal finance. And it is the bottom line in business finance.</p>
			<p class="docText">As an entrepreneur or manager, your job is to contribute to the bottom line, to ensure that income exceeds expenditure and happiness ensues. If you are an entrepreneur you will be painfully aware of this pressing detail of business life. For managers in larger corporations, the bottom line often becomes buried under the pressures of deadlines, pandering to the boss and playing office politics. But however you look at it, it’s all about money.</p>
			<p class="docText">Often, the money thing is painfully self-evident. You may have profit, income or expenditure targets to meet, budgets to live within, projects to bring in without exceeding spending limits, and so on. Sometimes the financial aspects are less obvious: sales, production and other targets may be set in terms of the number of customers contacted, widgets sold, quality control failures or website outages. But once you have a <span class="docEmphasis">feel</span> for the connection between these numbers and cash in the bank, you are well on your way to success.</p>
			<p class="docText">This book focuses on helping you to achieve success in business finance by managing the numbers. All of them. This is so important that I will keep reiterating it throughout the book. The old saying <span class="docEmphasis">look after the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves</span> could well be rephrased as <span class="docEmphasis">look after the nuts, bolts and washers and the pounds will pile up</span>.</p>
			<p class="docText">This book is not written for financial experts or statistical specialists. It is written for executives in all walks of life. It aims to provide the basic tools for financial management – reviewing, analysing, interpreting, estimating, forecasting, projecting, and so on. It covers a wide range of techniques, but, since you can get away with a little less of the statistical stuff, it puts a little more emphasis on the financials. It debunks some of the myths about accounting. It highlights the scope for creativity, obscuration and outright cheating – and shows you how to catch and counter this. It discusses current international issues in finance which could affect you as a manager. In short, it gives you the inside track. This will assist you not only in building your own financials, but, significantly, in interpreting those prepared by others. It will also help to you hold your own when dealing with bank managers, the finance director and other bean counters and propeller heads.</p>
			<p class="docText">One final point. Supplemental material is available on this book’s website. Even if you don’t have time to master underlying numerical concepts or accounting techniques, you will be able to produce results using the wizards and calculators which are available for download. Whatever your needs, and however you approach <span class="docEmphasis">business finance</span>, I hope that this book helps you in your mission.</p>
