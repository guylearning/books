			<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1457"></a>Where do currencies go when they are left to find their own levels? No one knows exactly. You would think with all these economists and computers around there would be an exact explanation. But there you are. Of course, as with any price set by the markets, the key factors are supply and demand.</p>
			<p class="docText">Logically, you would expect that if you can go shopping in any country, you will choose to buy from the one with the lowest prices. Demand for that nation’s cash, to acquire its goods and services, will push up its currency rate until its <a id="iddle1344"></a><a id="iddle1454"></a><a id="iddle1459"></a><a id="iddle1460"></a><a id="iddle1472"></a><a id="iddle1573"></a><a id="iddle1575"></a><a id="iddle1924"></a><a id="iddle2046"></a>price advantages are eroded. To quantify this, and look at it from another angle, if US inflation is 4% and Canadian inflation is 3%, the US dollar will have to fall by 1% to restore <span class="docEmphasis">purchasing power parity</span> (assuming that inflation actually measures the relevant internationally traded basket of goods and services).</p>
			<p class="docText">However, life is not this straightforward. The major global <span class="docEmphasis">financial flows</span> are not trade related – they reflect capital funds slopping around the world’s financial markets in search of the <span class="docEmphasis">best</span> investment returns. Best, in this context, means optimization of the risk-reward duo, taking account of financial, economic, monetary, political and other conditions and expectations. Thus, in the longer-term exchange rates may be trying to adjust so that there is purchasing power parity between nations, but, in the shorter term, volatile capital flows can and often do cause wild swings.</p>

				<p class="docText">For managed currencies, appreciation and depreciation are known as <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_380">revaluation</a></b> and <span class="docEmphStrong">devaluation</span>.</p>

			<p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_209">Floating</a></b>. Of the world’s 170 or so currencies (they change so fast – it seems as if there were a dozen more at the start of the millennium), only about 30 are determined directly by market forces. These include the US, Canadian and Australian dollars, the euro, the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, Britain’s pound, and other major monetary units which dominate trade and international payments. Historically, the exchange rates for these currencies were <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_204">fixed</a></i> by governments and central bankers – which is why they are now referred to as <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_209">floating</a></i>. Central banks sometimes intervene to smooth out extreme peaks and troughs – giving rise to the expression <span class="docEmphasis">dirty floats.</span></p>
			<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Fixed, with the market’s consent.</span> The majority of less developed countries fix their rates to varying extents, either with <span class="docEmphasis">managed floats</span> (about one-third of all currencies) or by <span class="docEmphasis">pegging</span> their units to the dollar, the currency of another trading partner, or – most popular – a basket of currencies. This might give a semblance of certainty, but beware. Central bankers who try to stem the forces of supply and demand often find that the dam breaks and the currency comes plunging down under the pressure of pent up market forces. Make sure you are not standing in the way. This is a fitting point to discuss ways to cover your corporate exposure to foreign currency risk.</p>

It hardly needs to be said that before doing business with a major foreign corporation, you may find it useful to review its credit rating. It is also worth noting that the rating agencies grade the creditworthiness of whole countries. When you are reviewing the risks of doing business across borders, these ratings may help you assess the economic and political risks of a new venture. Apart from anything else, a country with severe economic problems may be more likely to impose or extend foreign exchange controls restricting or prohibiting the exchange of currency between residents and non-residents.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/>
