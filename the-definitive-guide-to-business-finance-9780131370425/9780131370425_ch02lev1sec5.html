			<p class="docText">The choice here was for me to do some work or for you to do some work. Guess who won? I am going to ask you to turn back to the <span class="docEmphasis">Mastering money management</span> questions at the start of this chapter and look over the <span class="docEmphasis">Ten hard questions</span>. They provide a useful summary of what you might take away from this chapter. Actually, I was not being lazy. I just did not want to be repetitive. Perhaps we can strike a deal. I will not repeat the obvious, if, in return, when you reach the end of each chapter you will look back to the <span class="docEmphasis">Survival toolkit</span> to ensure that you hit upon the key points that I wanted to make. Let me know if I failed anywhere and I will amend the next edition.</p>
