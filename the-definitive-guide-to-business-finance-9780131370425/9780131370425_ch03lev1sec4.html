			<p class="docText">Having had a reasonable shot at assassinating the personality of beanies, I should perhaps reiterate that my cynicism should be taken with a large pinch of salt. Accountants and financiers are essential to the functioning of every business. Their cool logic and analytical approach provides a valuable balance for risk-taking managers and entrepreneurs. Moreover, there are some things, such as understanding tax regulations and filings, that no one else can be expected to do. Love them or hate them, you just can’t live without them.</p>
			<p class="docText">By the way, I should give you a little warning. I am going to switch tack for a few pages, and review spreadsheets and some ways of handling numbers. These topics are very interesting in their own right, but they also lay the groundwork for managerial success with the numbers – as discussed in the final chapters of this book.</p>
