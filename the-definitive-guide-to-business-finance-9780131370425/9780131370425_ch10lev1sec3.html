			<p class="docText">Take a look at <a class="docLink" href="#ch10fig01">Fig. 10.1</a>, which charts sales figures over three years. Before you read on, grab a pencil and extend the lines to show what you think might happen to sales during the year ahead.</p>

			<p class="docText">We will not embarrass each other by discussing what you drew in and whether you changed it subsequently. (You should probably have said that you needed more information before you could make the forecasts – even after reading the three facts.) True, quick and dirty forecasts sometimes rely almost wholly on projections – expecting more of the same. And managers frequently forecast almost on hunch – making educated guesses based on their perhaps subjective understanding of the situation. But the best forecasts combine both these methods; that is:</p>
