			<p class="docText">Now that you have reviewed each of the main financial statements, it is time to look at how you combine the information in them to assess the status of a business. You might be dealing with your own financials, they might be provided by a business partner or they might be taken from published corporate reports. Generally, you will have the most information available from your own financials, and the least amount with published reports. Keep this in mind when you get down to the analysis.</p>
			<p class="docText">This chapter reviews techniques for analysis, and then applies them all to some of the financial statements already encountered.</p>
