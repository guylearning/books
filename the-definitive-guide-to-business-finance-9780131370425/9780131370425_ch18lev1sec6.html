			<p class="docText">I do not know about you, but I quite enjoyed that. We covered a lot of ground together, but the going did not seem too tough. The techniques just discussed can be applied to any financials, and, in many instances, to other figures are well. Moreover, you can quickly build a spreadsheet (did anyone mention this book’s website?) to crunch the numbers and lead you to more learned understanding and better decisions. Indeed, most of the little tables in this chapter can be arranged into one spreadsheet for rapid review.</p>
