			<p class="docText">I want to apologize in advance. In the previous three chapters you and I chatted happily about things finance-related. In this chapter I am going to ask you to actually do something. I will start gently, but in the second half of the chapter I want you to experiment with spreadsheets. I will try to explain each task in plain English before degenerating into the <span class="docEmphasis">press this and click that</span> of books for computer dummies. I think that if you have made it thus far, you will probably find this all very easy. Moreover, if you are already slick in the spreadsheets, you can skip over much of this. Incidentally, though, there are some secret spreadsheet shortcuts revealed here which are great timesavers.</p>
