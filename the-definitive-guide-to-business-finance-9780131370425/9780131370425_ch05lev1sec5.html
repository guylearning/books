				<h4 id="title-ID0EIDAG" class="docSection2Title">Making figures significant</h4>
				<p class="docText">A certain company’s net profit was a few cents over $18,208,371 last year. When the CEO reported the results, he described the profit as ‘just over $18.2 million’. This was more sensible than reading out the amount to the last dollar, because the audience would have been struggling to make sense of a number read to eight <span class="docEmphasis">significant figures</span>. The precise figure was there in an annex for anyone with particular interest to read.</p>
				<p class="docText">Detailed figures should be calculated to an appropriately high degree of accuracy, but numbers summarized in the body of reports or given in presentations are usually better rounded. Normally, you can make the number easier to comprehend, especially for large amounts, as follows:</p>
				<ul><li><p class="docList">Round them to two or three <span class="docEmphasis">significant figures</span> (the first number above has <span class="docEmphasis">eight</span> and the second number <span class="docEmphasis">three significant figures</span>), and</p></li><li><p class="docList">include at most two <span class="docEmphasis">decimal places</span> (i.e. two digits after the point).</p></li></ul>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1428"></a><a id="iddle1986"></a><a id="iddle2053"></a><a id="iddle2081"></a><a id="of"></a>The combination is known as the number of <span class="docEmphasis">effective figures</span>. A good rule of thumb it to use as few effective figures as possible, while ensuring that relevant differences are apparent (for example, if you were describing production tolerances to one-thousandth of an inch, it would not make sense to round to the nearest half-inch). With sensible rounding, your audience can focus their attention on what you are saying, rather than on decoding complex numbers.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EOFAG" class="docSection2Title">Maintaining accuracy</h4>
				<p class="docText">As surprising as this might sound, you can have problems with spreadsheet accuracy. Let me give you an example.</p>
				<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Suppose you divide 100 by 7. A spreadsheet will tell you that the answer is 14.2857142857143000... If this figure is, say, your retail price for some cog or sprocket, you will probably round up to $14.29. If you sell 1,000 units, your revenue will be $14,290.00.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><a id="spreadsheet"></a>If you do the entire sum using a spreadsheet <span class="docEmphasis">without</span> rounding, the total <span class="docEmphasis">when rounded</span> is $14,285.71.</p></div></li></ol></div>
				<a id="ch05note03"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">The 4/5 rule</p>
					<p class="docText">Calculators and spreadsheets generally round using the 4/5 rule. That is, values ending in four are rounded down, while those ending in five are rounded up. For example, 1.4 is rounded down to 1, while 1.5 is rounded up to 2. You will, perhaps, be in good company if you adopt this convention: for example, the European Central Bank follows it for exchange rate calculations.</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">The spreadsheet’s answer is a few dollars lower than the rounding-at-each-stage example. Repeat such discrepancies over thousands of items, and the amounts involved could be huge. Even one penny out of balance is too much for the grey suits – and when you project your financials using spreadsheets you often find that your figures are out by just this amount. This is because we usually format the spreadsheet to show two decimal places – but the ‘fully-accurate’ figures are retained by the spreadsheet and used in the calculations. The problem then is that the numbers look OK, but they do not appear to add up correctly, as shown in <a class="docLink" href="#ch05fig02">Fig. 5.2</a>.</p>

				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1609"></a><a id="iddle2068"></a>Fortunately, spreadsheets have some built-in functions that deal very effectively with this excess precision. They are shown in <a class="docLink" href="#ch05fig03">Fig. 5.3</a> and, I think, speak for themselves. Usually, the simple ROUND function is adequate. Remember that sometimes instead of rounding to the nearest amount, you need to round up or down (are you buying or selling?).</p>

However, your spreadsheet will display 0.66666666666666700000....two-thirds to 15 significant figures only. This is usually not a problem for business arithmetic.

The following table shows how two times two can be anything between two and six. It is easy to introduce significant errors in just a couple of steps if you round in the wrong place. The numbers in the first column all round to two (and everybody knows that 2 × 2 = 4). But when the numbers in the first column are multiplied by themselves and the result is rounded, the answer comes out at anything between two and six. Worse, 1.45 rounded once is 1; or, alternatively, it rounds to 1.5 which rounds to 2 (see the 4/5 rule opposite).</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>
				<p class="docText">Apply common sense to avoid both spurious accuracy (not enough rounding) and too much rounding. Generally, you need to do your analysis and forecasting using un-rounded numbers, and then round off each value before putting them in your financial projections.</p>
