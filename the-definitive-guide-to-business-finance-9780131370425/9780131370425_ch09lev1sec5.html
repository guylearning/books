				<h4 id="title-ID0ESUBG" class="docSection2Title">Quantifying relationships</h4>
				<p class="docText">For this example using interest rates, open a new spreadsheet and into one column paste or key your monthly sales over several years and in the next column enter interest rates for the same periods. Average interest rates would be better, but if they are not available, rates on a given date each month are OK. It is better to remove extraneous factors, and use the cyclical component in your sales – or at least a series that has had one-offs and seasonal factors removed (sales less one-offs, multiplied by the seasonal adjustment factor).</p>
				<a id="ch09note07"></a><div class="docNote"><p class="docNoteTitle">Wide-ranging relationships</p>
					<p class="docText">If you are really keen, you can have several columns of x values – interest rates, consumer spending, etc. and look for relationships between them all and your sales. Expand your selection for the results (E7 to F11 in the example here) to accommodate the extra returned values.</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">You also want to get the turning points side by side. If you think that the time lag between a change in rates and a blip in your sales is three months, you should select all the interest rates and move (drag) the selection back three rows. This way, changes in interest rates will be next to the change in your sales. You can inspect the effectiveness of this by quickly drawing a chart to see if the turning points match.</p>
				<p class="docText">Then you would choose a group of cells in an empty area of the spreadsheet – say, E7 to F11 – and from the menu select <span class="docEmphasis">Insert, Function, Linest</span>. In the dialog that appears, you select the sales figures as the <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> values, interest rates as the <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> values, and then type in <span class="docEmphasis">true</span> for both <span class="docEmphasis">constant</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">stats</span>. Then, and this is where it is easy to go wrong, you do not press <span class="docEmphasis">OK</span>, but instead you press <span class="docEmphasis">Ctrl-Shift-Enter</span> (who dreamed up that one?). This covers the spreadsheet work. Now for the interpretation.</p>
			
			<a id="ch09lev2sec14"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0E1VBG" class="docSection2Title">Interpreting the results</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1941"></a>After entering the function described above, cells E7 to F11 will contain some useful numbers. The first row gives the values for the equation of a line – see <span class="docEmphasis"><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch09lev1sec3.html#ch09lev3sec6">Estimating sales</a></span> above. The first entry in the third row is our friend r-squared. It is probable that this figure will be so low that you will not have any confidence in the estimated relationship – remember it should be well above 0.9 (i.e. 90%) to be of value. Regression (the statisticians’ name for the analysis we have just done) rarely produces magnificent results in these general business situations. You can try moving the data (e.g. by 2 or 4 months instead of 3) to see if you get a better fit.</p>
				<p class="docText">The next row down shows some values termed the F statistic and degrees of freedom. These are potentially useful – helping assess whether any apparent relationship between the two series occurred by chance or not. Unfortunately, if you want to interpret them you will need statistical tables and a <span class="docEmphasis">quant</span> (a person who passes the time doing quantitative analysis with computers). It is much the same with the other numbers returned by the spreadsheet function. However, the simple equation and r-squared are enough to help you decide if the relationship you were looking for is quantifiable. A good test is to use the equation with past values of interest rates, see what sales values were predicted, and compare the equation for <span class="docEmphasis">forecast</span> with last year’s sales. Would the predictions have been accurate or too wide of the mark?</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0E1WBG" class="docSection2Title">Using the results</h4>
				<p class="docText">If in the example above you found a relationship which your judgement told you was worth using, you have to allow for timing differences caused by moving the interest rates series. In other words, with the four-month lag described above, your estimated sales in April would be based on actual interest rates in January. <a class="docLink" href="#ch09fig07">Figure 9.7</a> illustrates this graphically. The calculations are available for download from this book’s website.</p>
