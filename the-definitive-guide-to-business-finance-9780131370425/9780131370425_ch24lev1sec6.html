			<p class="docText">Sadly, for me anyway, we are out of space. We have reached the final paragraph or two. If this were a detective story, whom would you suspect? I suppose it depends which role you have assumed. A typical manager would point the finger at the chief financial officer, who, after all, blocks expenses claims, holds back pay increases, and pours cold water on great ideas which appear not to be viable on purely financial grounds. IT propeller heads would also tend to blame the finance top dog, because so many IT projects are good for the enterprise but hard to quantify in monetary terms. The chief executive would probably share the same view, because, after all, who wants a subordinate who can wield more power than the boss?</p>
			<p class="docText">From an external perspective, bankers and shareholders know that the books cannot be cooked without the chief financial officer’s assent. The CEO or a group of directors might be bent on paying themselves excessive bonuses, massaging the numbers, or outright theft, but the CFO will have to be in on the plot before it can hatch.</p>
			<p class="docText">Whichever way you look at it, finance directors have a tough job. Perhaps we should offer them some sympathy. It’s not easy to become a bean counter. It took hard work and dedication. However, because of this they have only themselves to blame. Accordingly, make sure that they give you the figures and support that you need to do your job. Then go out and do <span class="docEmphasis">what smart managers do with the numbers</span> – stay on top of them. Its not difficult, and it will give you a significant leg up on your journey to ever greater success. I wish you luck.</p>
