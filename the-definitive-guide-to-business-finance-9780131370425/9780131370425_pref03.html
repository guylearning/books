		<p class="docText">It is my pleasure to acknowledge and thank the countless individuals and organizations that contributed to the development of this book. I cannot list them all, but special mention should be made of the International Accounting Standards Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the US, and the Accounting Standards Board in the UK (the IASB, FASB and ASB – you will meet these and other acronyms in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a> and beyond) and their counterparts in many other countries.</p>
		<p class="docText">I must also thank Microsoft Corporation (<a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a>) and the Cyber-dynamics Group (<a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.cyber-dynamics.com">www.cyber-dynamics.com</a>) for their assistance with the spreadsheet issues and for developing various financial tools which are available for download from this book’s website, <span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.DefinitiveGuideToBusinessFinance.com">www.DefinitiveGuideToBusinessFinance.com</a></span>.</p>
		<p class="docText">Of course, sincere thanks are due to my family, friends and colleagues for their input and especially for putting up with my quirks and idiosyncrasies while I was writing this book. My son Alex made a sterling contribution. He is definitely not a beanie, but there is a likeness of him in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
