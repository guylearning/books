			<h3 class="docSection1Title">Conclusion</h3>
			<p class="docText">This concludes our little foray into some of the more advanced decision-making techniques. I hope that you found it useful. It might even have encouraged you to go back through your forecasts and projections from earlier chapters. I have to say that my personal favourite is the normal distribution as applied to the future (as discussed throughout this chapter). Statisticians may not be overjoyed by the lack of rigour with which it is sometimes applied in business situations. But from a management viewpoint, any quantification of uncertainty and risk is welcome.</p>
