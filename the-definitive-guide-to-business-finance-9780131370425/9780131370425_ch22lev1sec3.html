			<p class="docText">A majority of corporations and not-for-profit organizations use budgets as the main instrument of financial control, and often as a key measure of performance. In many cases, budgets have become onerous, bureaucratic burdens. Consequently, it is popular to criticize them and search for alternatives â€“ which usually involve cost targets, activity-based costing, categorized investment appraisal, flexible or rolling budgets or a balanced scorecard approach.</p>
			<p class="docText">The striking point about budgets and all of these so-called <span class="docEmphasis">alternatives</span> is that corporations should be using all these things in conjunction anyway. I do not know about you, but I would not want my performance to be measured on how well I controlled spending on office stationery alone. Moreover, I do not see how I could judge the success of things I manage using beanie bean-counting alone. But it is also clear that the big ducks upstairs need to plan and control company finances, not least cash flow. If there is a problem, it is not the concept of budgets, but their execution, which is in question. A budget is a useful tool if it is used sensibly, is as unbureaucratic as possible, and is just one of a range of measurements and controls.</p>
