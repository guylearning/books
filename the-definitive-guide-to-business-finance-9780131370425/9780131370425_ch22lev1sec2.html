			<p class="docText">Budgets can be the bane of any manager’s life. It always seems to be time to prepare next year’s budget, report on progress or attend a meeting on some aspect of budgeting. Yet if you put a structure in place and get on top of the budget process, it can be quite simple and – dare I suggest – a useful exercise for all concerned. I suppose mentioning that it might become a pleasure would be going too far.</p>
			<a id="ch22note01"></a><div class="docNote">
				<p class="docText">This chapter is written from the assumption that you are preparing a budget as part of a larger, probably enterprise-wide budgeting exercise. If it happens that you are in charge of the overall budget process, just read the following from that perspective.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EVNDI" class="docSection2Title">Budgets, right or wrong</h4>
				<p class="docText">Budgets are simply short-term financial plans. They usually cover a 12-month period, although rolling budgets with no hard and fast start and end points are better. The best budget plans also contain at least a page or two of written explanation. (See, for example, <a class="docLink" href="#ch22fig02">Fig. 22.2</a>.) Once approved, the plans become a summary of expected activity, a tool for management control, and a target against which performance is measured. This is where the problems arise.</p>
				<p class="docText">These spending plans become limits – floors and, especially, ceilings. Managers can usually get away with some undershooting on expenditure, but overshooting is often a heinous crime. This conflicts directly with the best performance metrics, which should stretch the organization and encourage growth. Accordingly, it is important to maintain a common-sense approach to budgets and keep the good of the enterprise foremost in your thinking. Budget figures should not be taken in isolation. A <span class="docEmphasis">balanced scorecard</span> approach is required (see overleaf).</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EVRDI" class="docSection2Title">An overview of the budget process</h4>
				<p class="docText">Budgets typically run in an overlapping 18-month cycle, with the targets covering 12 months – frequently a calendar year. See <a class="docLink" href="#ch22fig01">Fig. 22.1</a>.</p>
				<a id="ch22fig01"></a><p></p><div class="center">

					<p class="docText"></p><div class="st1"><a target="_blank" href="http://ssl.safaribooksonline.com/getfile?item=ODA3ZzBkLzN0c2NpZ3AvbS85ZTE0M3I3MjE1YWFybHRhcGdzaDBpMmMvMTJfZ3BqLmZp">[View full size image]</a></div><img src="9780131370425_ch22lev1sec2_image02.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="672"/>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">Generally, senior executives set targets, preferably in a two-way consultation with managers (top-down, bottom-up). From these targets, operating plans are devised and financial projections are developed. There may well be a couple of rounds of, shall I say, negotiation and revisions before the plans are approved. The financial plans then become budgets.</p>
				<p class="docText">Managers are usually required to report on progress at the end of each month, comparing actual spending (often called <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_320">outturn</a></i>) with the budget targets. Beanies term this process the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_026">analysis of variance</a></i> to highlight the fact that they come from a different planet. There will probably be more detailed and more painful reviews every three months. Then, when the budget year has ended, there will be an extensive post-mortem. If you have ever been involved in a project or budget, there is no need to elaborate on the witch hunts that follow missed targets and the chocolate beans that are handed out in reward when targets are met.</p>
				<p class="docText">Given that targets usually affect salaries and bonuses, and these figures themselves go into budgets, goals are frequently set for a 12-month period which is slightly ahead of the budget year. For example, when the budget year runs from January to December, a manager may be rewarded (or punished) for his performance over the 12 months to the end of October or November.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="docText">‘Dozens of times I have asked CEOs and other corporate leaders how they stay on top of their large, complex businesses: “How do you know what’s really going on in your company?” Invariably, I receive the clear answer that they have five or six – maybe 10 or 12 – key business indicators that they track daily or weekly. These indicators tell them what they need to know about their company’s current performance and near-term prospects. Without notes or preparation, most CEOs can tell you in just a few minutes exactly what these indicators are and what the current numbers are telling them.’</p>

					<h5 id="title-ID0EPUDI" class="docSection3Title">Who prepares the budgets?</h5>
					<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1199"></a><a id="iddle1965"></a>Usually each department head or business unit manager with spending responsibility prepares a budget. When all these separate budgets are aggregated, they will create a spending plan for the enterprise as a whole.

					<p class="docText">Of course, the department head’s own budget may be created by aggregating budgets which were prepared by subordinate managers. The budgeting process can – and probably should – ripple deeply into the organization. There is inevitably an element of centralization in bringing together the plan, but watch that central planning <span class="docEmphasis">per se</span> takes the initiative away from the individual manager and can be demoralizing and damaging.</p>

It does highlight that there can be benefits in asking hard questions such as ‘Just because we are already spending this much on that, does it make it right?’</p>
					</div><br/>
					<p class="docText">Ideally, all department heads should be involved in developing the strategic plans and then setting assumptions and collective targets. The individuals involved will be more likely to understand and support these parameters. Personal targets may be a more private matter. If you are a department head conveying the parameters to your subordinates you have a more difficult job ensuring their buy-in. Perhaps you can involve them when you are preparing your input before the targets and assumptions are set.</p>
				
				<a id="ch22lev3sec4"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EXDAK" class="docSection3Title">Developing spending plans</h5>
					<p class="docText">Once the targets and assumptions are agreed, they should be communicated in writing to department heads.

					<p class="docText">Be prepared to explain and defend your budget plans to a committee. If you are in a large or formal organization, and near the top of the budget process, you may need to make a PowerPoint or at least a whiteboard presentation. Otherwise, perhaps you will talk your colleagues through your written report. In either case, explaining the whats, whys and hows should take you through the process fairly smoothly.</p>
					<p class="docText">Invariably, at first brush, there will be conflicting departmental activities, or aggregate spending will be too high, or the overall corporate plan will not be ambitious enough, or too ambitious, or whatever. Be prepared to revisit and revise your plan. Budgets frequently contain padding – room to make cuts up front if required or wriggle if the year turns out to be worse than expected. Watch for this in budgets passed up to you and, I guess, try to avoid doing it yourself. It is better to grade activities according to how essential they are – and to start cutting with the least essential if necessary.</p>

If you are not sure when a transaction will happen, put it in an earlier month. Delaying the purchase until later might save an overshoot. If the spending is one-off (such as buying a filing cabinet), you have a one-time reprieve. If it is repetitive or cumulative (hiring an employee, or starting a production line), a couple of months’ delay could add up to a big saving by year end. Of course, the same applies to sales – if they start or increase earlier than expected then you could exceed your budget comfortably.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>

					<p class="docText">Once the budget year is in full swing, each month you will be required to produce a summary comparing what did happen with what you expected to happen, and write a short commentary explaining the difference between the two (the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_459">variance</a></i>, to use a word beloved of bean counters). It will be a rare budget that is spot on target all year. An extract from a monthly report is as follows:</p>
					<p class="docText"></p><div class="st1"><a target="_blank" href="http://ssl.safaribooksonline.com/getfile?item=ODA3ZzBkLzN0c2NpZ3AvbS85ZTE0M3I3MjE1YWFyYWxfcHBzaGdmM2MvMDUxaWouZ3QxaQ--">[View full size image]</a></div><img src="9780131370425_ch22lev1sec2_image09.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="277"/>

					<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The first spreadsheet is the original budget – what was planned.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The second shows the actual transactions (the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_320">outturn</a></i>) – what happened.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The third analyses the variances – where the reality diverged from the plan.</p></div></li></ol></div>

					<p class="docText">The third spreadsheet was used to produce the report above. It shows planned and actual spending in the month, together with the actual and percentage <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_459">variance</a></i> between the two. It also does the same for the year to date – the first six months in this example.</p>
					<p class="docText">The three rows – salaries, travel and total spending – are illustrated graphically in <a class="docLink" href="#ch22fig04">Fig. 22.4</a>. With such pictures, it is easy to spot what is happening. You can read the same information from the budget report (the lower spreadsheet). Taking each in turn:</p>
					<ul><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Salaries.</span> Salaries were close to budget each month until June. Over the first six months they were just 2.3% above plan and even in June itself they were within what might be regarded as a reasonable margin of error – 10%. However, the sudden jump in June suggests an unexpected event – perhaps across-the-board pay awards or recruitment of an extra member of staff. This merits investigation.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Travel.</span> The percentage variances show that travel spending is running seriously over budget and needs investigation. Looking back at the raw data there is persistent overspending that should have been questioned already.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Total spending.</span> The summary shows that total expenditure in the year to June was 5.6% over the level of <span class="docEmphasis">identified</span> planned spending, but still within the overall plan including the 10% contingency. Spending in the month of June was over target.</p></li></ul>

					<p class="docText">What does all this tell us? It indicates that percentages are more revealing than raw numbers. It shows that many questions can be raised by a quick perusal of the budget report. It highlights the fact that more information is needed. It is, incidentally, valuable to include volume figures – such as planned and actual headcount, number of units produced or sold, volume of inventory, number of contracts completed. Most important, you cannot make any decision without looking at both the spending and the revenue side of the equation.</p>
