			<p class="docText">The cash flow statement is the third and final <span class="docEmphasis">major</span> financial statement (after the profit and loss account and the balance sheet). It is necessary because profit and loss accounts bear only a passing relationship to the money that actually changes hands. The cash flow statement focuses on, need I say, changes in liquidity – and incidentally reveals a lot more than just what is happening to the bank balance. Recall that the profit and loss account reveals profits. Take these two financial statements together and you have a remarkably good picture of profitability and liquidity. These are the prerequisites for overall success. In the long term it is not possible to run a business unless you have both.</p>
			<p class="docText">This chapter describes the cash flow statement, what it is, how it is structured, what it shows, how to interpret it and how to project your own cash flow requirements.</p>
			<a id="ch16lev2sec4"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0E6OBI" class="docSection2Title">More revelations from the balance sheet</h4>
				<p class="docText">As mentioned in the previous chapter, balance sheets are snapshots. The differences between two balance sheet dates show the net change but not necessarily all of the activity that took place. The cash flow statement records these net changes, and by rearranging them into a specific classification it helps with the interpretation of corporate results.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EKPBI" class="docSection2Title">Cash flow statement – what it is</h4>
				<p class="docText">A statement of <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_075">cash flow</a></i>
					<span class="docEmphasis">–</span> or <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_407">sources and uses of funds</a></i> – explains changes in cash and cash equivalents during the period of the accounts (quarter, year, etc.). Cash equivalents are highly liquid instruments that are capable of being converted into known amounts of cash without notice. In the major accounting jurisdictions there is a requirement that the original maturity of the instruments should be less than three months.</p>
				<p class="docText">Cash flow can be described <span class="docEmphasis">directly</span> by showing receipts from customers and payments to suppliers, employees, government, and so on (<a class="docLink" href="#ch16fig01">Fig. 16.1</a>). It can also be derived <span class="docEmphasis">indirectly</span> by starting with net profit or loss and reversing out non-cash items (<a class="docLink" href="#ch16fig02">Fig. 16.2</a>). This is how most corporations report cash flow, and this is the easiest approach when you are making your own forecasts and projections. In addition to showing how cash is generated, the cash flow statement also shows use of funds. This is essentially:</p>
				<ul><li><p class="docList">Cash from operations</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">less</span> cash used in investing activities</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">less</span> cash used in financing operations</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">equals</span> change in cash balances.</p></li></ul>

				<p class="docText">The following diagram illustrates these sources and uses of funds. In the example shown, there is surplus cash generated from operations. Of course, there could instead be a deficit – which is often the case when businesses are in phases of start-up, growth, recovery, and maturity. Investing and financing could also reflect sources or uses of funds, depending on many factors.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0ERTBI" class="docSection2Title">Cash flow statement – what it shows</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1232"></a><a id="iddle1235"></a><a id="iddle1499"></a><a id="iddle2116"></a>The cash flow statement is rather a nifty little document. Most financial regulators, including the International Accounting Standards Board, require that the statements classify cash flow into operating, investing, and financial activities.</p>
				<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="#ch16fig02">Figure 16.2</a> illustrates cash flow using the <span class="docEmphasis">indirect method</span>. The techniques for constructing these tables are discussed below. The content is self-explanatory, especially if you trace the sources of each entry back to the balance sheet (see the notes in the figure). Each of the entries has already been discussed under the heading <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_044">balance sheet</a></i>, above. Accordingly, these notes do not labour through the figures, but list what goes into each category and indicate typical disclosure requirements. Before we begin, two other points are worth noting:</p>
				<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Cash flows relating to taxes are usually disclosed separately within operating activities, as here, but they could be identified under one of the other headings.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Investing and financing activities that do not give rise to cash flows (e.g. non-monetary transactions such as the acquisition of property by issuing debt) are excluded from the cash flow statement, but disclosed separately.</p></div></li></ol></div>

				<p class="docText">Cash flow from operations is a key indicator of the health of the company. As already mentioned, this figure is often negative when the company is growing <a id="iddle1231"></a><a id="iddle1606"></a>(because cash is tied up in inventory and receivables, etc.). There is cause for concern if cash flow from operations is negative and the business is not growing, or if cash flow is negative for a prolonged period.</p>
				<p class="docText">The cash flow statement also indicates how much is being invested for future growth. When interpreted carefully, this helps assess the ability of the firm to generate cash flows in the future. And, of course, the cash flow statement also reveals how the business is financed, which could be a major influence on the ability to keep trading – and could highlight inefficient use of capital. We will return to this in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>.</p>
