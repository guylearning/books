However, there are two variations that can be used. They are known rather pompously as <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_299">net present value</a></i> and <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_254">internal rate of return</a></i><a id="the"></a>. Let me introduce them and then explain about the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_157">discount rate</a></i>.</p>

				<p class="docText">The practical application of net present value and the internal rate of return, and the choice between them is discussed in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch21.html#ch21">Chapter 21</a>.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0E5SAG" class="docSection2Title">Net present value</h4>
				<p class="docText">The <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_299">net present value</a></i> of any future stream of income is essentially the amount of money that you would need to put in a bank deposit today at a given rate of interest to generate the identified cash flows. For example, if you project the pattern of spending and income that a project is expected to generate, calculate the present value of each future cash amount and sum the results, you arrive at the overall <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_299">net present value</a></i> of a project (sometimes called the NPV). The projects with the highest net present value usually get your money.</p>
				<p class="docText">You will have guessed that spreadsheets perform this calculation painlessly. See <a class="docLink" href="#ch06fig02">Fig. 6.2</a>. As you can see from the example, you can have payments and receipts dotted around. You are not constrained to just one outlay or a series of regular receipts. Watch though, that at different interest rates – more properly called the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_157">discount rate</a></i> – different projects become more attractive because of the varying valuations of future income and payments. You might want to try changing the discount rate in cell B3 (the spreadsheet can be downloaded from this book’s website) to see what happens to the net present value.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0E4UAG" class="docSection2Title">Internal rate of return</h4>
				<p class="docText">The alternative to using net present value is a measure named the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_254">internal rate of return</a></i> (also called variously <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_263">IRR</a></i>, <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_134">discounted cash flow, DCF</a></i> and <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_470">yield</a></i> – and you thought that your marketing people were bad at naming things). The <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_254">internal rate of return</a></i> is simply the compound interest rate that links the present and future. Think of it as the interest rate that a bank would have to charge if it were to make you a loan (the project cost) that was going to generate the predicted future stream of repayments (the returns). Since we are dealing with the future, the interest rate is more properly called – you’ve got it – the discount rate. In this case, the projects with the highest internal rate of return are the top picks – so long as the rate exceeds a predetermined level discussed in a moment.</p>
				<p class="docText">Spreadsheets do the sums for you, as shown also in <a class="docLink" href="#ch06fig02">Fig. 6.2</a>. Note that if the rate in cell B3 had been set equivalent to the internal rate of return of 25%, the net present value in cell B1 would be zero. Try it.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EUWAG" class="docSection2Title">Selecting a discount rate</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1409"></a><a id="iddle1783"></a><a id="iddle1798"></a>Choosing the discount rate is not quite as simple as it might at first appear. Obviously, you might use bank interest rates as the discount rate, but this will not really take allowance of your actual costs of capital and the risks involved. In <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a> we will look at calculating the cost of capital, and in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch21.html#ch21">Chapter 21</a> we will discuss the way to use this to arrive at the appropriate rate to use for corporate projects.</p>
