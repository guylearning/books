			<p class="docText">If you ask your computer accounting system to print a detailed <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_444">trial balance</a></i> for, say, the first month of your new business, it will produce a tidy list of all your accounts, showing the transactions during the month and the ending balance of each account. The terminology is a throwback to when daily transactions were written up by hand in <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_265">journals</a></i>, and totals were transferred to the <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_271">ledgers</a></i> (main books of accounts). At regular intervals, clerks would write down the balance of every account and check that the sum of all the debits equalled the sum of all the credits. Looking down this trial balance – your ledgers – will be instructive. You will find it gives you a good feel for what is happening in your business. The bank balance shows the net cash position. The trial balance shows you exactly where the money comes from and goes to.</p>

				<p class="docText">Another neat trick is to ask your accounting system for a profit and loss account (income statement) for a given period, and a balance sheet for the end of the period. These will be printed quickly and painlessly. They show a summary of all the accounts in your books, set out in a way which gives you a quick picture of the overall situation. They might seem a little alien right now, but we will come back to their interpretation in later chapters.</p>
