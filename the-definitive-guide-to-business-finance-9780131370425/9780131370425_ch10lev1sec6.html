			<h3 class="docSection1Title">Making the forecast</h3>
			<p class="docText">By now, you have squeezed the patterns out of your sales records and decided how you are going to develop your forecast. It is time for some spreadsheeting. Begin by building a completely mechanical forecast, and then add in judgement or cause and effect. This is discussed next.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EUZBG" class="docSection2Title">Rulers only</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="#ch10fig04">Figure 10.4</a> shows the analysis from the previous chapter (<a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch09lev1sec3.html#ch09fig03">Fig. 9.3</a>), with most of the patterns projected mechanically into the future – for 2007 and 2008. This is the step-by-step approach (you can walk through it in the workbook that accompanies this chapter – see website).</p>

					<h5 id="title-ID0E61BG" class="docSection3Title">Step 1: Extend the trend</h5>
					<p class="docText">In <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a>, the formula was calculated and keyed into column G. All you have to do is copy the formula down through the cells for 2007 and 2008.</p>
				
				<a id="ch10lev3sec4"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0ER2BG" class="docSection3Title">Step 2: Extend the cyclical factors</h5>
					<p class="docText">The easy way to do this is examine the chart of the cycle, identify by eye which part of the cycle is missing in the forecast period, then copy the appropriate chunk of an earlier cycle to provide the projection (see <a class="docLink" href="#ch10fig05">Fig. 10.5</a>). This is a bit simplistic, but it works. In the example, the projection requires the part of the cycle from 2001 Q3 through to the end of 2003, so select cells I60 to I69, copy them, then select cell I80 and choose <span class="docEmphasis">Paste Special</span>, <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_454">Values</a></i> (we want the values, not the formula).</p>
					<a id="ch10fig05"></a><p></p><div class="center">
						<h5 class="docFigureTitle">Fig 10.5. Extending the cycle</h5>
						<p class="docText"></p><div class="st1"><a target="_blank" href="http://ssl.safaribooksonline.com/getfile?item=ODA3ZzBkLzN0c2NpZ3AvbS85ZTE0M3I3MjE1YWFybHRhcGdzaDBpMWMvNTBfZ3BqLmZp">[View full size image]</a></div><img src="9780131370425_ch10lev1sec6_image02.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="209"/>
					</div><br/>
				
				<a id="ch10lev3sec5"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EB4BG" class="docSection3Title">Step 3: Extend the seasonal adjustment factors</h5>
					<p class="docText">These repeat every four periods, so it is just a case of copying the formula down through the forecast period.</p>
				
				<a id="ch10lev3sec6"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EM4BG" class="docSection3Title">Step 4: Extend the one-offs</h5>
					<p class="docText">There is some cheating here. If this were a purely mechanical forecast, there would be no allowance for special one-offs. However, assume that you have applied some judgement and estimated that price-cutting promotions will add 10% to sales in the third quarter of the two years ahead. Key in these judgemental figures in column E.</p>
				
				<a id="ch10lev3sec7"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EX4BG" class="docSection3Title">Step 5: Out with the glue</h5>
					<p class="docText">Finally, recombine the series to get the total forecast for sales volume. The formula is shown in <a class="docLink" href="#ch10fig04">Fig. 10.4</a>.</p>
					<p class="docText">This is all there is to it. There is no need to forecast the unsmoothed cycle and seasonal factors, while noise, by definition, cannot be forecast and as discussed is assumed to average out to about zero over time.</p>
