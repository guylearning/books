			<p class="docText">The calculations concerning the present and future value of money are valuable aids to financial decision-making. The following examples illustrate their practical <a id="iddle1614"></a><a id="iddle1873"></a><a id="iddle2036"></a>application. Note that in all the examples, the interest rate is expressed as a proportion (e.g. 5% is entered as 0.05) and it is assumed that interest is compounded once a year. The sample spreadsheet for this chapter shows the formulas in use and includes some more complex examples.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0E1RAG" class="docSection2Title">Sinking funds</h4>
				<p class="docText">A situation might arise where you want to set aside a lump sum to replace a machine in five years’ time (although this might not be the best use of a cash surplus – see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>). For example, suppose you know that you will need to spend $50,000 in five years’ time, and interest rates are 5% per annum. You can probably see that you need to find a <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_341">present value</a></i> that equates to the required <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_222">future</a></i> amount. Use of the spreadsheet formula in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch06lev1sec4.html#ch06fig01">Fig. 6.1</a> would reveal that you should put $39,176.31 on deposit today at 5% per annum interest to produce $50,000 in five years’ time.</p>
				<table cellspacing="0" class="allBorders" border="1"><colgroup align="left" span="2"><col width="350"/><col width="100"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th scope="col" style="text-align:left" class="docTableCell thead" align="left" valign="top">Formula</th><th scope="col" style="text-align:center" class="docTableCell thead" align="center" valign="top">Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">=PV(rate, periods, payment, future value, type)</td><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">=PV(0.05, 5, ,50000,0)</td><td class="docTableCell" align="center" valign="top">$39,176.31</td></tr></tbody></table><br/>
				<p class="docText">If, alternatively, you want to set aside a regular amount each year for five years to produce the lump sum, you can use a variation on the arithmetic. Logically, there are five separate future value calculations, which together add up to $50,000 – that is, five separate growth rates as shown on the left of the following table. Fortunately, there is a spreadsheet formula to do the work, as shown in action on the right. Either approach produces the values in the middle column – which shows how each annual amount would grow with the addition of compound interest.</p>

				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1740"></a><a id="iddle1947"></a>The table reveals – if you look closely – that you would have to set aside $9,048.74 a year at 5% per annum interest to save $50,000 over five years. In fact, you need only to use the formula at the bottom-right of the table to find the desired figure. I will explain why.</p>
				<p class="docText">These time-value calculations assume that interest is paid at the end of each period. In this example, final amount is put on deposit at the very end of the five years, and so does not have time to earn any interest. It is included in the calculation for one period only, which explains the 1 used in the formula. In other words, to use PPMT to find any principal amount, enter 1 for the period. In any such calculations, if you want to allow for the final amount earning interest, add one period (in this example, instead of 5 use 6). Note also that the formula is multi-purpose, and present value is left blank because it is not relevant in this instance.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EI2AG" class="docSection2Title">Finance up front</h4>
				<p class="docText">Take a variation on the previous example. Imagine that you have a project which needs finance of $10,000 a year for five years. What lump sum would your financiers have to put on deposit now at 5% per annum to allow you to draw down this annual cash requirement? Hands up if you spotted that you can use the present value formula in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch06lev1sec4.html#ch06fig01">Fig. 6.1</a>, as follows:</p>
				<table cellspacing="0" class="allBorders" border="1"><colgroup align="left" span="2"><col width="300"/><col width="100"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th scope="col" style="text-align:left" class="docTableCell thead" align="left" valign="top">Formula</th><th scope="col" style="text-align:center" class="docTableCell thead" align="center" valign="top">Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">=PV(rate, periods, payment, FV, type)</td><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">=PV(0.05, 5, 10000, ,0)</td><td class="docTableCell" align="center" valign="top">$43,294.77</td></tr></tbody></table><br/>
			
			<a id="ch06lev2sec13"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EY4AG" class="docSection2Title">One person’s loan ...</h4>
				<p class="docText">You will recall that one person’s loan is another’s investment. If your financiers wanted to borrow the $43,294.77 required in the previous example, how much would they have to pay back over five years at 5% per annum? Go to the top of the class if you said $10,000 a year. It is exactly the same situation as just discussed, but viewed from the perspective of the lender rather than the depositor. Of course, in reality, the interest rate charged to the lender would be higher than the interest rate paid to the depositor. The difference between the two – the spread – is how bankers traditionally made their money (these days, they tend to charge outlandish fees for everything as well).</p>
			
			<a id="ch06lev2sec14"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0ED5AG" class="docSection2Title">Repayment schedule</h4>
				<p class="docText">Spreadsheets provide a useful formula for determining the repayment schedule for loans where the amount and interest rate are known. Perhaps you want to borrow $50,000 at 5% per annum repayable in equal instalments over five years. The following formula shows that the annual repayment is $11,548.74.</p>
				<table cellspacing="0" class="allBorders" border="1"><colgroup align="left" span="2"><col width="350"/><col width="100"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th scope="col" style="text-align:left" class="docTableCell thead" align="left" valign="top"><a id="iddle1046"></a><a id="iddle1104"></a><a id="iddle1222"></a><a id="iddle1412"></a><a id="iddle1850"></a><a id="iddle2008"></a>Formula</th><th scope="col" style="text-align:center" class="docTableCell thead" align="center" valign="top">Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">=PMT(rate, periods, present value, future value, type)</td><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="left" valign="top">=PMT(0.05, 5, 50000, ,0)</td><td class="docTableCell" align="center" valign="top">$11,548.74</td></tr></tbody></table><br/>
				<p class="docText">Obviously, the average annual interest charge is $1,548.74 (since the other $10,000 of the repayment is reducing the principal) and the total interest charge is $1,548.74 × 5. If you divide each of the five repayments by the appropriate interest factor, similar to the PPMT example above, you will find, of course, that less of the principal is repaid in the early periods – when most of the payment is going to cover the interest. I have done it for you in the spreadsheet that you can download from this book’s website.</p>
			
			<a id="ch06lev2sec15"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0ETBBG" class="docSection2Title">Awards and scholarships</h4>
				<p class="docText">Now suppose your altruistic board of directors decided to make an annual award of $10,000 to the most promising widget scientist. At first glance it might appear that you would need to put an enormous amount on deposit to guarantee this payment (known as a <span class="docEmphasis">perpetual annuity</span>, if you want to know). However, when you realize that the annual payment is no more than the interest on the lump sum, it becomes clear that the amount required is not so large. If interest rates were 10% per annum, the required deposit would be $10,000 / 0.10 = $100,000. If interest rates halved, the amount required would be $10,000 / 0.05 = $200,000. Simply divide the lump sum by the interest rate. This is not hard.</p>
			
			<a id="ch06lev2sec16"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EBCBG" class="docSection2Title">Discount for cash</h4>
				<p class="docText">Business suppliers frequently offer a discount of around 2% for immediate payment. Is this good value? The trick is to annualize the rate and compare it with other rates. Typically, such discounts entail you parting with your cash about 15 days faster than you would otherwise. On this basis, there would be 24 conversion periods in a year, so the equivalent annual rate is 24 × 2% = 48% per annum (this is simple, not compound, interest). In effect, your supplier is borrowing from you at 48% a year for 15 days, and then using the cash to pay for the goods. If you have surplus cash earning less than this (it would be highly unusual if it was earning more), accept the discount with both hands. If you would incur interest charges yourself, then if they are less than 48% you should also take the discount. In effect you would be borrowing, say, from your bank at 10%, and on-lending at 48% a year.</p>
				<p class="docText">So, is it good practice for you to offer your debtors similar discounts for early payment? It certainly would be if you have a cash flow crisis. It might also be worthwhile if you can get a better rate on these amounts receivable that you can on a similar value of payables. In effect, you might make money by borrowing from your clients and lending to your suppliers – although, of course, if you are not a bank this is not your business.</p>
			
			<a id="ch06lev2sec17"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EOCBG" class="docSection2Title">Rent or buy?</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1207"></a><a id="iddle1670"></a><a id="iddle1946"></a>You will frequently have the option of buying, say, machinery or office equipment – or leasing. You can find out which is better value by putting both streams of payments onto the same basis.</p>
				<p class="docText">For example, you can buy a computer server for $5,000 or lease for $250 a month for two years. The outright purchase option has a present value of, well, $5,000. At a discount rate of 12% (a convenient 1% per month) the PV calculation reveals that leasing has a present value of just over $5,310. Leasing is slightly more expensive. If your costs of capital (see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>) are more than 12% per annum leasing might be more competitive. Do not forget that leasing also has cash flow advantages, and there might be warranty or maintenance benefits as well.</p>
				<p class="docText">The comparison just discussed assumed that the computer had no residual value. If you own the leased computer at the end of the period, residual value makes no difference – since in both cases you end up with an asset with the same future value. For example, if you judge that the computer will have market value of $1,500 after two years, this effectively adds a present value of about $1,000 to both calculations – leaving the relative merits much unchanged. You will have noticed that the PV calculation has a payment ($250) and a future value ($1,000) slot which we have not used before now. This example is as follows:</p>
