			<p class="docText">This chapter builds on the analysis covered so far in this book, by applying it to projects. The focus is on appraising, authorizing, planning and managing projects. Ensuring that they come in on budget is obviously critical, and this theme is continued in the next chapter.</p>
			<p class="docText">A key identifying element of a project is its finite or temporary nature. It has a beginning and an end date (which themselves are targets) and could run for as little as a day or as long as years or decades. However, I am going to stretch a point and ask you to consider almost any business activity as a project. The techniques discussed here can help you with most issues related to managing finances.</p>
			<p class="docText">Thus, a project in the current sense could be anything you spend money on, or which generates a future stream of revenue, or both. This covers most business activities, including installing a new computer network or clump press, undertaking R&amp;D, acquiring investment property, building a power plant, undertaking a joint venture, or acquiring another company. In fact, you could look upon running a business as running many projects in tandem. The top-level project (running the enterprise) is really a <span class="docEmphasis">programme</span> but letâ€™s not worry too much about semantics in this respect.</p>
			<p class="docText">Relevant analysis from previous chapters includes, well, pretty much everything: forecasting, fixed investment, costs, financial statements, return on investment, the cost of capital, oh yes, and using spreadsheets. Do not worry, though, if you have not read the previous chapters yet, you should still be able to make sense of this one.</p>

What you have to do is put the options onto the same basis and make a sensible comparison.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>
