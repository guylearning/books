			<p class="docText">We have covered a great deal of ground in this chapter. I hope that it provided food for thought about using a surplus or financing a deficit. Remember that cash in the bank claws down your return on investment (ROI). As discussed, the largest ROI should come from minding your own business. If ultimately you can earn more by putting the money in a bank, you might as well sell the business and sit on a beach. But you are not going to do this. The next chapter picks up the theme nicely for two reasons. First, it discusses how you manage the numbers while building an international business. Second, it introduces some new forms of finance associated with foreign trade. See you there.</p>
