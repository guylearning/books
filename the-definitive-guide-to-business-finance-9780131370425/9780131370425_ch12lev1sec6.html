			<p class="docText">In the foregoing discussion, I outlined the way that you project employee and other spending. There is one footnote required. It is not really feasible to estimate all your future revenue and spending to the last penny. Rather than allowing slack in any specific item of spending, you should estimate each one as accurately as possible. It would be good if in the event over-estimates cancelled out under-estimates. In practice, under-shooting is rare. Accordingly, it is usual to build in a contingency which can be raided if necessary. Provided that outturn is less than the projection for total spending including contingency, you will have met your planning figures. The contingency is usually added at the end of the spending accounts, as summarized in <a class="docLink" href="#ch12fig06">Fig. 12.6</a>. In this example, there is an allowance of 10% of total spending. Watch that contingencies do not become an excuse for excessive spending. If the estimates are basically last year’s spending plus 10%, and there is another 10% contingency on top, you have effectively authorized a 20% surge in outlays.</p>

				<p class="docText">‘The accurate measurement of input costs is essential for determining whether the corporation earned a profit from its current activities. That determination was relatively straightforward when all receipts were cash and all expenses were cash costs. But, changes in balance-sheet valuations based on fragile forecasts have become a more important element in determining whether a particular corporate strategy was successful. And, as a consequence, cost estimation has become ever more problematic. But the principle of measuring profit as the value of output less the value of input is not altered by complexity of measurement.’</p>
