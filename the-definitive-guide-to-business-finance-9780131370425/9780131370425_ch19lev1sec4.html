			<p class="docText">The trade credit, loans, and bonds mentioned above are all forms of debt. The most important point is the obvious: debt is repayable (for all intents and <a id="iddle1140"></a><a id="iddle1151"></a><a id="iddle1291"></a><a id="iddle1447"></a><a id="iddle1502"></a><a id="iddle1526"></a><a id="iddle1680"></a><a id="iddle1705"></a><a id="iddle1731"></a><a id="iddle1739"></a><a id="iddle1881"></a><a id="iddle2125"></a><a id="iddle2217"></a>purposes, equity is not). Moreover, lenders are very demanding. They are concerned mainly with security and cash flow. They usually lend to borrowers who <span class="docEmphasis">own</span><a id="they"></a> more than they <span class="docEmphasis">owe</span> and who can prove that they can definitely afford to pay it back. That is, corporate borrowers need assets and cash flow. The main cost is the interest payment. There will also be arrangement fees and commissions which you should factor into your costing. I will come on to this in a moment.</p>
			<a id="ch19lev2sec7"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0E6MCI" class="docSection2Title">Debt instruments</h4>
				<p class="docText">Corporate notes and bonds are simply forms of debt which can be traded in secondary markets. For example, a major corporation might make a <span class="docEmphasis">$500 million issue of 10%, 10-year loan stock</span>. This means that the company raises about $500 million from, probably, many lenders, and is committed to paying $50 million per annum in interest for 10 years and to buying back the bonds for $500 million at the end of the period. Note that for the company, this is simple interest; it is not compounded. Investors who buy these bonds can sell them at any time that they can find a buyer. The price will reflect the interest rate on debt which investors perceive have comparable risk. OK, I will explain.</p>
				<a id="ch19lev3sec1"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EMNCI" class="docSection3Title">Pricing</h5>
					<p class="docText">If you bought $10,000 of 10% long-dated bonds, you would receive a fixed $1,000 a year in interest (<span class="docEmphasis">the coupon</span>). If interest rates for similar debt halved to 5%, you would be able to sell the paper for double what you paid for it – because the $1,000 annual coupon amounts to 5% of $20,000.</p>
					<a id="ch19note05"></a><div class="docNote">
						<p class="docText">The starting point for <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_251">interest rates</a></b> is the rate at which bankers will lend to the lowest-risk borrowers. In the US this is known as the <span class="docEmphStrong">prime rate</span> for obvious reasons. Elsewhere, the term <span class="docEmphStrong">base rate</span> is common. Higher-risk borrowers will pay prime or base rate plus 2% points, or 3%, or 10% or whatever. The granddaddy of money-pricing yardsticks is the London interbank offered rate (<span class="docEmphStrong">LIBOR</span>), and you will hear mention of many other IBORs, including the unpronounceable <span class="docEmphStrong">EURIBOR</span>.</p>
					</div><br/>
					<p class="docText">However, as the bonds approach maturity, the market price moves towards the redemption value. No one would pay $20,000 even for 10% interest if in a year’s time they would have to give up the bonds for a mere $10,000. This is the <span class="docEmphasis">time value of money</span> at play (we first met this in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
					<p class="docText">The basic rule of thumb is that if interest rates or the perceived risk fall, the market value of bonds rises. If interest rates or the perceived risk rise, the value drops. There is no cash flow effect for the company, except that if interest rates move while the issue is first being arranged, the initial proceeds may be different from the face value. Otherwise, the interest payments and redemption will be unchanged (but see <span class="docEmphasis">Debt restructuring,</span> below).</p>
				
				<a id="ch19lev3sec2"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EFPCI" class="docSection3Title">Variations on a theme</h5>
					<p class="docText">Bonds may be <span class="docEmphasis">unsecured</span> (except that they rank above share capital for repayment in the event that the company fails), or secured against fixed assets, usually land and buildings. <span class="docEmphasis">Zero coupon bonds</span> are issued at a discount to the redemption value. Junk bonds are highly speculative – see <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_119">Credit rating</a></i>.</p>

Prime credit worthy businesses are rated AAA (referred to as <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_445">triple A</a></i>). The second tier is rated AA; upper-medium risk companies are rated A, and the lower-mediums are BBB (Baa under Moody’s classification). Anything lower than this is classed as <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_266">junk</a></i> – highly speculative in ability to meet financial obligations. Clearly, the higher a company’s ratings, the lower the perceived risk and the lower its cost of borrowing. Quite aside from financing issues, if you are about to do significant business with another company you might want to check its credit rating.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>
