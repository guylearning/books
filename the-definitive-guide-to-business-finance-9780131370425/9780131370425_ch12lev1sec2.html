				<h4 id="title-ID0EYLAI" class="docSection2Title">Costs in the financials</h4>
				<p class="docText">There are many ways of categorizing spending; but, for basic analysis, approvals, and reporting, beanies carve up costs as follows:</p>
				<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_349">Production costs</a></b> (<b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_111">cost of sales</a></b>) – current spending <span class="docEmphasis">directly</span> associated with sales, such as the acquisition of raw materials and the costs of production.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Other operating expenses</span> – <span class="docEmphasis">indirect</span> current consumption; overheads such as the finance director’s salary and other administrative costs which drain the bank balance whether you sell anything or not.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_063">Capital</a></b> – spending on assets with an expected life beyond the current accounting year, such as clump presses and aircraft.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">Other (non-operating)</span> – generally nasty stuff such as taxation and interest on loans.</p></div></li></ol></div>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1028"></a><a id="iddle1299"></a><a id="iddle1313"></a>We have already taken a look at capital spending, which feeds into production and operating costs. In this chapter we will look at costs in general and operating expenses in particular. In the next two chapters we will look at the cost of sales and other costs.</p>
				<a id="ch12note02"></a><div class="docNote">
					<p class="docText">When accountants refer to current spending on production and operating overheads they sometimes say ‘ these costs should be <span class="docEmphStrong">charged to income</span>’ or refer to them as <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_381">revenue costs</a></b>. This may seem to be a contradiction in terms, but there you are.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EBPAI" class="docSection2Title">Breaking it apart</h4>
				<p class="docText">As always, the key to dealing with any problem is to break it into little pieces. Your company structure may have achieved the first step already. The top level may be organized along one of the following lines:</p>
				<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Industry or product – soaps, aerospace, brands.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Geography – Spain, Europe, North-West.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Function – R&amp;D, sales, etc.</p></div></li></ol></div>
				<p class="docText">Corporations are likely to move up this structural tree as their products and services become less homogeneous and the business grows – although the first two items on the list might be switched around. Basically, for forecasting and projection, you want to make these splits until you reach level three – activities organized by function. Then:</p>
				<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">For each functional area, separate spending into employee and non-employee costs.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">For each of employee and non-employee costs, separate spending into related sub-categories: salaries, overtime, premises, office, travel, and so on.</p></div></li></ol></div>
				<p class="docText">In a moment we will step through each of these items.</p>
			
			<a id="ch12lev2sec6"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0ENQAI" class="docSection2Title">Timing</h4>
				<p class="docText">You could analyse costs on a cash basis – when the spending took place rather than when the goods or services were consumed. However, for management review and financial reporting you will want to look at costs on an accruals accounting basis (<a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>). This moves you closer to matching spending and results. I have already introduced the method of passing the bookkeeping entries to achieve this. If you are recording your own financials on this basis, or if your bean counter or accounting department is doing it for you, your historical figures will be ready for review.</p>
				<p class="docText">When you come to projecting costs, as far as possible try to match them to the relevant months. For example, for a bonus which is payable in December, you should record <img src="9780131370425_ch12lev1sec2_image01.jpeg" alt="" width="15" height="22"/> of the amount against each month of the year. For quarterly rent paid in January, show one-third against each of the first three months of the year. In <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch16.html#ch16">Chapter 16</a> I will show you how to convert this bookkeeping into a cash flow forecast.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EQRAI" class="docSection2Title">When costs are not expenditure</h4>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1310"></a><a id="iddle1322"></a><a id="iddle1392"></a><a id="iddle1433"></a><a id="iddle1792"></a><a id="iddle1893"></a><a id="iddle1938"></a><a id="iddle2115"></a><a id="iddle2120"></a><a id="iddle2190"></a>Right now, we are trying to analyse and project the underlying spending which goes into profit or loss. Some outlays do not count as production or operating costs. We have already covered fixed assets – where the original outlay is treated as an asset and only depreciation is counted as expenditure against net profit.</p>
				<p class="docText">Another obvious example is when you pay a refundable deposit when you rent a vehicle or office space. At some time in the future, this will be paid back to you (unless you trash the place, in which case the deposit really will become an expense).</p>
				<p class="docText">Clearly you want to know about such payments, without recording them as expenses. Accordingly, when working through the costs figures, you should identify any spending which creates an <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_032">asset</a></i> and make a note of it in a separate spreadsheet table. In <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a> you will record these in the balance sheet.</p>
				<p class="docText">Similarly, keep an eye open for activities which do not involve spending now, but which might create a liability in the future – such as taxes. If the cost is <span class="docEmphasis">more likely than not</span> to occur, you will need to record it as a liability when you come to draw up a balance sheet. Other liabilities, such as possible adverse legal cases or environment clean-ups, should at least be noted for management review – and possibly there is a disclosure requirement. For the moment, just make notes. Later we will look at this in more detail.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EXUAI" class="docSection2Title">The certainty of taxes</h4>
				<p class="docText">Benjamin Franklin once said that the only two certainties in life are death and taxation. If so, the only certainty for a corporation is taxation, which is a bit distressing. By and large the Grim Reaper pays scant attention to companies (see <span class="docEmphasis">Debt restructuring</span>, <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a>). But taxes pop up all over the place and they need to be identified separately. For example, if you spend $110 on telephone bills and $10 is a sales tax, you should show $100 as a telecoms expense and $10 as taxation. This is particularly important with value added taxes – and other taxes where you can claim back all or part of the taxes you pay – because the tax may or may not be a cost depending on the level of your sales (see also <span class="docEmphasis"><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch08lev1sec8.html#ch08sb02">Debts and taxation</a></span> in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>). I know it is certainly a pain to split all this spending into two parts, but remember that I am only the messenger.</p>
