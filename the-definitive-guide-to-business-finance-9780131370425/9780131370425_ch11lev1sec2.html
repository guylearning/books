			<p class="docText">The previous chapter looked at forecasting sales. Now it is time to look at the cost side of the equation. Start by considering capital spending. Compared to other spending, capital outlays:</p>
			<ul><li><p class="docList">often involve larger sums of money;</p></li><li><p class="docList">are usually subject to a unique approvals process;</p></li><li><p class="docList">generally do not immediately produce substantial income relative to their costs;</p></li><li><p class="docList">are expected to produce future benefits; and</p></li><li><p class="docList">receive special treatment in financial statements.</p></li></ul>
			<p class="docText">For these reasons, it is useful to discuss them separately from other costs. We will look at how you account for them in general, and then discuss a whole range of related management issues. The main focus here is on the bean counting, which embraces financial accounting, tax accounting and – perhaps most important – management accounting. Elsewhere, we will discuss capital budgeting, investment and project appraisal (see <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch22.html#ch22">Chapters 22</a> to <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch24.html#ch24">24</a>).</p>

Collectively, these are known as <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_204">fixed assets</a></i>. They do not have to be things you can touch and feel. They can also be intangible, as with software development by a computer company and goodwill on the acquisition of another business. Note that from a financial analysis and accounting viewpoint, mergers and acquisitions are treated in much the same way as any other major item of capital spending.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>

				<p class="docText">If you spend a million on machinery that will be used over 10 years, how do you show it in your financial accounts? All other things being equal, if you charged the million to today’s operational spending your profit and loss account would look rather sick this year, especially if you had not started using the machine. On the other hand, your profit and loss account would be very healthy next year when the machinery was producing output for no apparent outlay, other than perhaps the cost of feeding and maintaining it.</p>
				<a id="ch11note01"></a><div class="docNote">
					<p class="docText">You would be right in regarding your <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_258">inventory</a></b> as an asset, but it is not classed as a fixed asset. It is treated as a current asset – and discussed in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</a>.</p>

				<p class="docText">Accordingly, it is usual and rational to divide the purchase cost of capital goods into several parts and charge them to operating costs over the life of the machine. For example, a $30,000 machine with a three-year life span and no residual value might be thought of as costing you $10,000 per annum for three years.</p>
				<p class="docText">The exact way that you allocate the costs over time is specified by your:</p>
				<ul><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">depreciation policy</span> for physical assets;</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">amortization policy</span> for intangible assets; and</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">depletion policy</span> for natural resources.</p></li></ul>
				<p class="docText">Depreciation, amortization and depletion are different names for exactly the same thing – writing off costs over the working life of the asset. From now on, please take references to depreciation to include amortization and depletion as appropriate.</p>
				<p class="docText">You can have a different depreciation policy for each category of assets (plant, machinery, office, etc.) or sometimes even for each asset. You will see how it works in a moment. Usually, it results in financial accounts which show assets at their historic cost or some other artificial book value.</p>
