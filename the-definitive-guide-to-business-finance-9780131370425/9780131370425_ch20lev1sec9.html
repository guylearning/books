			<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1173"></a><a id="iddle1465"></a><a id="iddle1479"></a><a id="iddle1558"></a><a id="iddle2141"></a>So far, we have been dealing with foreign currency <span class="docEmphasis">conversions</span>. Interesting problems arise with foreign currency <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_440">translations</a></i>, where no money changes hands but bookkeeping entries and financial statements are restated in a different currency. We touched on this in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch18.html#ch18">Chapter 18</a> (see <span class="docEmphasis"><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch24lev1sec3.html#ch24lev2sec12">Comparing competitors</a>)</span>. Let me give another example which shows how unavoidable errors and discrepancies can arise.</p>
			<a id="ch20lev2sec9"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EEBDI" class="docSection2Title">Sleight of hand</h4>
				<p class="docText">A subsidiary records payments due to its parent company (but does not necessarily make the payments) in March and August. At the rate applicable on the dates of the entries, a total of $100 million was owed to the parent company. See following table.</p>
				<p class="docText">However, the transactions are probably not booked at the spot exchange rate applying on the transaction date. Companies which handle a large number of transactions frequently use a fixed <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_053">book rate</a></i> for a given period, such as a month or a year. This rate is usually fixed <span class="docEmphasis">in advance</span> based on recent observations.</p>
				<p class="docText">For example, the rate to be used here might be that in force on 1 January. If so, these payments would have been booked at $90 million (lower than ‘actual’). Alternatively, the beanies might have seen the euro appreciating and projected a rate of €1 = $1 (i.e. <span class="docEmphasis">parity)</span> – in which case the transfers would have been recorded at $95 million (still too low). On the other hand, if they were making up the accounts at the end of the year with the benefit of hindsight, they might legitimately have used the end-year or, better, the annual-average rate. If so, the payments would have been overstated by as much as $6 million.</p>

				<p class="docText">This illustrates how accidental or judicious selection of exchange rates can influence the numbers. You have to be especially careful in watching what other people do in this regard.</p>
			
			<a id="ch20lev2sec10"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0ENJDI" class="docSection2Title">Translating financial statements</h4>
				<p class="docText">Another occasion when the choice of exchange rates introduces problems is when translating a complete set of financial statements. There are two major problems:</p>
				<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">Many differing exchanges rates can, and usually do, apply. There would be a blue moon in the night sky if the financial statements balanced neatly after translation. A balancing entry – <span class="docEmphasis">translation gains or losses</span> – has to be added to the accounts. This is discussed in a moment.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The value of the figures can become questionable. Suppose your South American branch acquires a building for the equivalent of $100,000. If the exchange rate depreciates by 20%, has the dollar value of the building fallen to $80,000? It can hardly be exported. What if inflation over the same period was 20%?</p></div></li></ol></div>
				<a id="ch20lev3sec5"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EHKDI" class="docSection3Title">Single or multiple rates</h5>
					<p class="docText">In the simplest form of currency translation, all figures in financial statements are transformed from one currency to another at the spot exchange rate on, say, the balance sheet date. This is easy and consistent, but inaccurate. The revenues and expenses took place during a period when exchange rates might have been moving considerably. One solution is to use a second exchange rate, an average exchange rate for the period, to translate the flows. An example is shown in <a class="docLink" href="#ch20fig02">Fig. 20.2</a>.</p>
					<a id="ch20fig02"></a><p></p><div class="center">
						<h5 class="docFigureTitle">Fig 20.2. Translation mischief at work</h5>
						<p class="docText"></p><div class="st1"><a target="_blank" href="http://ssl.safaribooksonline.com/getfile?item=ODA3ZzBkLzN0c2NpZ3AvbS85ZTE0M3I3MjE1YWFybHRhcGdzaDBpMmMvMjBfZ3BqLmZp">[View full size image]</a></div><img src="9780131370425_ch20lev1sec9_image01.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="786"/>
					</div><br/>
					<p class="docText">With a single rate, all relationships and vertical ratios are maintained. With a dual rate, the figure used to translate the amount of retained earnings is different for the balance sheet and the profit and loss account. Accordingly, you have to fudge the accounts and include an <span class="docEmphasis">exchange rate gain or loss</span> as indicated in the example. In this illustration, comprehensive income (profit) in euros has been boosted by 5% even though nothing fundamental has changed. The discrepancy could be much larger, which shows how careful you have to be when interpreting comprehensive income. It also reinforces the importance of calculating ratios using the accounts in the original measurement currency (as discussed in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch18.html#ch18">Chapter 18</a>).</p>
				
				<a id="ch20lev3sec6"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EZLDI" class="docSection3Title">Four methods of translating accounts</h5>
					<p class="docText">There are four common methods of translation, two of which are all but obsolete. They are:</p>
					<p class="docText"><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_126">Current</a></b><span class="docEmphStrong">/</span><b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_303">non-current</a></b>. Current assets and liabilities are translated at the current rate and non-current assets and liabilities at the applicable historical rates. Flaws include valuing inventory at current exchanges rates and long-term debt at historical rates. These are practices which could distort the underlying position considerably. Now you know about it, forget it.</p>
					<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Temporal.</span> This translates cash, receivables, payables, and assets and liabilities curried at present value using current exchange rates, and all other assets and liabilities at historical rates. Formerly used by the US, among other countries, this is similar to the next re-measurement technique, by which it has been replaced. You can disregard this technique also.</p>
					<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Monetary/non-monetary.</span> You can probably guess that this technique translates monetary balance sheet entries at current rates and all other assets and liabilities at historical rates (the valuation on acquisition or revaluation). It is required by US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) when records are not maintained in the <span class="docEmphasis">functional currency</span> (i.e. the home currency of the principal entity).</p>
					<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Current rate.</span> This translates all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange that is current on the balance sheet date. Arguments in its favour include maintaining the ratio between debt and the assets it is used to acquire. It is prescribed by US GAAP when the functional currency is the foreign currency.</p>
				
				<a id="ch20lev3sec7"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0ESNDI" class="docSection3Title">The new standard</h5>
					<p class="docText">International accounting standards distinguish between foreign operations which are integral to the business of the parent and other foreign entities. Whether or not a foreign entity is integral to the parent requires some judgement. General rules that signify that the foreign entity is <span class="docEmphStrong">not</span> integral to the reporting company include:</p>
					<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">autonomy of the foreign entity;</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">no more than a low proportion of its transactions are with the reporting company;</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">activities are financed primarily from its own resources or borrowing;</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">labour and other costs are settled in its own currency;</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">sales are not principally in the reporting company’s currency;</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">reporting company’s cash flows are not directly affected by foreign operations.</p></div></li></ol></div>
					<p class="docText">In either case, income and expense items are translated at transaction rates. In practice, this usually means an average of end-month exchange rates – which can be an extremely inaccurate measure.</p>
					<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Foreign operations which are integral.</span> The monetary/non-monetary method of translation is used. Two points should be noted. Inventories are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the date of acquisition or, if revalued, at the date or revaluation. Depreciation is translated using the currency rate at the date of acquisition or revaluation – which affects the figure that goes into the profit and loss account. Differences arising on translation of monetary items are set against net profit, except that net investment in a foreign entity is reported in equity until disposal of the asset or liability.</p>
					<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Other foreign entities.</span> The current rate technique is used and translation differences are taken directly to equity. In the instance of hyperinflation (defined in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch18.html#ch18">Chapter 18</a>), income and expense items are translated at the exchange rate current on the balance sheet date.</p>
