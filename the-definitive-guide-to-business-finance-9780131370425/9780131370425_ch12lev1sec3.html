			<p class="docText">Employee costs are probably the easiest outlays to analyse and project. You have an unmistakably identifiable headcount (if not, go out and count them) and the associated costs are usually clearly defined and probably well documented. Employee costs go far beyond salaries and wages, as indicated in <a class="docLink" href="#ch12fig01">Fig. 12.1</a>. You may also have other categories of expenditure, such as uniforms and – dare I mention it again – rice allowances.</p>

			<p class="docText">You can use a spreadsheet to tabulate employee costs for the purposes of budgeting and financial reporting – see <a class="docLink" href="#ch12fig02">Fig. 12.2</a>. It is a good idea to duplicate this table (use copy and paste) and then replace the monetary figures with percentages of the totals. Put a column into a pie chart for a quick visual representation of the breakdown. By reviewing the monetary amounts and the percentage breakdown, you get a good idea of where your employee costs hurt most.</p>

			<p class="docText">Analysis of employee costs might be by functional or geographic area. When producing financials for a business as a whole, you will certainly need one table for staff involved in production (cost of sales) and another for other workers. To see how much any one employee costs you, you will make a table listing salary, overtime, bonuses, employers’ social security contributions, and all the other employee-benefits and costs for that person. Your company’s salary records will already have this information, but for management analysis you may want to include an apportionment of office costs and so on.</p>

				<p class="docText">Your headcount projections follow naturally from your forecasts, estimates, budgets and business plans. When you know what you want to do, you can work out how many people with what skills you need to make it happen. Some of these may be on your payroll already. If you are starting a new business or expanding you will need to recruit. You will know from your existing payroll and your industry knowledge what packages of salaries and benefits you will need to provide. From here on it is simple arithmetic.</p>
				<p class="docText">If you were paying attention, you will be aware that the spreadsheet you use to project employee costs is formatted similarly to that in <a class="docLink" href="#ch12fig02">Fig. 12.2</a>. Essentially, for each item, enter <img src="9780131370425_ch12lev1sec3_image02.jpeg" alt="" width="15" height="22"/> of the annual total against each month, allowing for pay rises, amendments in social security rates and other changes. For some categories, you can use formula to calculate the amounts, such as when social security contributions are, say, 7.5% of salaries.</p>
