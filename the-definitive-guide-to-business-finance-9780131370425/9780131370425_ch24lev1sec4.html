			<h3 class="docSection1Title">When things go wrong</h3>
			<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1308"></a><a id="iddle1497"></a><a id="iddle1884"></a><a id="iddle2000"></a>No matter how thorough your planning and how diligent your stewardship, things can still go wrong. The most common problems are cost overruns or revenue undershoots. Occasionally, new targets are imposed, possibly from above because one department or division has problems, but in any event probably due to external factors such as unexpected economic developments or the withdrawal of funding. Whatever the problem, the implications are similar: the choices usually boil down to cutting costs, finding new revenue or obtaining new finance.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EIEAK" class="docSection2Title">Why did it turn bad?</h4>
				<p class="docText">Finding out why things went wrong occasionally helps with the current situation. More often than not the information is better used for averting another crisis in the future. The discrepancy between plan and outturn will relate to value, volume, or efficiency. Invariably, you will find that the problem arose because of poor planning or ineffective monitoring. Maybe the metrics were wrong, or perhaps they were not tracked carefully enough. Did you rely only on financial yardsticks? Or did new, unmonitored, factors creep in?</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0ETEAK" class="docSection2Title">Boosting revenue</h4>
				<p class="docText">By and large, boosting income is the most popular solution in a crisis, but it is usually the most difficult outcome to achieve. Start, though, by reviewing accounts receivable. If your accounting people have gone to sleep, an apparent revenue slowdown might be nothing more than inefficiencies in collecting payments due. Otherwise, lacklustre sales may be the very origin of the problem. The business is probably operating at the highest level of sales achievable without spending more on marketing and, anyway, increasing revenue usually takes time – a luxury which may be a scare resource if you are in a crisis. However, if demand for your products is elastic, you might be able to slash prices to jump-start sales. Regardless of how pessimistic you feel, you will, of course, explore other possibilities for putting more business on the books.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0E5EAK" class="docSection2Title">New funding</h4>
				<p class="docText">The financing angle may be an attractive alternative. If your crisis is very short term, you might be able to speed up collections and stretch out payables, or obtain additional credit from your suppliers. One possibility might be to dispose of assets and lease them back. You could consider trying to increase borrowing if you have the longer-term profitability, positive cash flow, and asset backing to support more debt. The final resort in debt restructuring, or refunding, is to try to raise additional equity.</p>

				<h4 id="title-ID0EJFAK" class="docSection2Title">Cost cutting</h4>
				<p class="docText">By far the most common reaction to the problems mentioned above is to cut costs. It’s basically quick and effective – in the short term at least. If you have arrived here via the preceding chapters, you will have realized that you should always expect the unexpected. For example, when preparing spending plans and budgets, always grade the items according to priority. You will then know exactly what to pare away to meet lower targets while limiting the other downsides. If necessary, review the plans to find ways to save or postpone costs. Remember the three places to look for savings: <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_454">value</a></i>, <i><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_461">volume</a></i>, <span class="docEmphasis">efficiency</span>. Some hints are included in <a class="docLink" href="#ch24fig01">Fig. 24.1</a>.</p>
