			<p class="docText">In the previous chapter you saw how ratios can be used to analyse financial statements. As promised, here are some more ratios. Indicators of debt reveal information about <span class="docEmphasis">solvency</span> – whether a business is borrowing too much or whether it could borrow more.</p>
			<a id="ch19lev2sec13"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0ECPCI" class="docSection2Title">Leverage (US) or gearing (UK)</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="docText">Debt <span class="docEmphasis">divided</span> by equity</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="docText">This indicates the extent to which a company is dependent on debt or equity. Analysts calculate this simple sum in various ways, which can affect comparisons. The best way is to define debt is as interest-bearing liabilities (loans) plus preference shares; and equity as ordinary shareholders funds. Also, it is better to use market values rather than book values.</p>
				<p class="docText">Low leverage/gearing indicates a low reliance on debt – finance is mainly equity – which suggests a greater likelihood that the company can borrow more if necessary. A highly geared/leveraged company has a higher reliance on debt, which could lead to a cash flow crisis.</p>
			
			<a id="ch19lev2sec14"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0EXPCI" class="docSection2Title">Debt to net worth</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="docText">Total debt (liabilities) <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> tangible net worth (shareholders’ equity less intangible assets)</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="docText">This compares what is owned with what is owed. A high ratio indicates that creditors’ claims exceed those of the owners. For example, a ratio of 2 indicates that liabilities are twice the size of tangible net worth. In this case a business is <span class="docEmphasis">borrowed up</span> and its ability to raise more debt is in question.</p>
			
			<a id="ch19lev2sec15"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0ENQCI" class="docSection2Title">Debt-service coverage (interest cover, times interest earned)</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="docText">Operating profit (before interest and tax) <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> annual interest payments</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="docText">This is another way of looking at gearing/leverage. It is also a measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest on borrowings. The higher the ratio the more likely it is that the business will be able to pay interest on (i.e. <span class="docEmphasis">service</span>) its debt. A figure of at least 3 is usually considered safe, and would be a good sign for <a id="iddle1282"></a><a id="iddle1424"></a><a id="iddle1519"></a><a id="iddle1547"></a><a id="iddle1696"></a><a id="iddle1971"></a>a company wanting to borrow more. A figure of below 1 indicates a high risk of default or bankruptcy.</p>
			
			<a id="ch19lev2sec16"></a>
				<h4 id="title-ID0ENSCI" class="docSection2Title">Contingent liabilities</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="docText">Contingent liabilities <span class="docEmphasis">divided by</span> shareholders’ equity</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="docText">Recall from <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a> that contingent liabilities are possible liabilities that do not show on the balance sheet. Contingent liabilities that are large in relation to equity could seriously undermine financial stability if they materialized into payments due.</p>
