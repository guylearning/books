					<p class="docText">To format a cell super-fast, select a cell (or range of cells) with your mouse and then press <span class="docEmphStrong">Ctrl–1</span> (hold the <span class="docEmphStrong">Ctrl</span> key down, press the number <span class="docEmphStrong">one</span> and let go of them both).</p>

				<a id="ch04sb09"></a><table cellspacing="0" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><td>
					<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Plain English</span>: this section explains how to insert a spreadsheet table into a word document. You can do a once-only <span class="docEmphasis">copy-and-paste</span>. Or you can insert a <span class="docEmphasis">dynamic link</span> so that when you change the spreadsheet, the word document is automatically updated.</p>
				</td></tr></table><br/>
				<p class="docText">Almost every report requires a cover and some explanatory text. You could do this in a workbook, using the first and last tab sheets as the cover and endnotes, and so on. However, you will soon discover that the relationship between a spreadsheet and a printed page is rather vague, and it is easier to write text in Word because that is what it is designed for.</p>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Copy-and-paste.</span> The easiest way to produce good-looking reports is to format your tables in Excel, and then insert them into your Word document. To copy data from a spreadsheet to a word document, which must both be open on your computer screen:</p>
				<ul><li><p class="docList">Select all the cells containing your table, <span class="docEmphasis">right-click</span> and choose <span class="docEmphasis">copy</span>; and then switch to the word document (<span class="docEmphasis">alt-tab</span>), <span class="docEmphasis">right-click</span> in the required location, and choose <span class="docEmphasis">Paste</span>.</p></li></ul>
				<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Dynamic linking.</span> <span class="docEmphasis">Copy-and-paste</span> could not be any easier. However, on many occasions you will want to use a sort of smart paste called <span class="docEmphasis">dynamic linking</span>. After you have created a dynamic link between two documents, any changes you make to the source will automatically be fed through to the target. For example, if you change a figure in the spreadsheet, next time you look at your Word document, it will have been mysteriously and automatically updated. This is a very powerful feature. To create a dynamic link requires only one more click:</p>
				<ul><li><p class="docList">In Excel, select all the cells containing your table, right-click and choose <span class="docEmphasis">copy</span>; and then switch to the Word document (<span class="docEmphasis">alt-tab</span>), choose <span class="docEmphasis">Edit/Paste Special</span>, and in the dialog box that appears choose <span class="docEmphasis">Paste link</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object</span>, then click <span class="docEmphasis">OK</span>.</p></li></ul>
				<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1208"></a><a id="iddle1604"></a><a id="iddle2066"></a>Now switch back to the spreadsheet (<span class="docEmphasis">alt-tab</span> again), change some figures in the table, flick back to the Word document, and the report will already contain the changes. If this appears to have potential, wait until you make your spreadsheet intelligent.</p>

				</td></tr></table><br/>
				<p class="docText">At last it is time to try a little trick which turns a dumb table into a very powerful thingumabob. Let me use a bit of simple arithmetic to demonstrate. Suppose you want to know the total of a column of numbers – such as those in <a class="docLink" href="#ch04fig03">Fig. 4.3</a>. With a mouse click and a key press you can have the spreadsheet do the sum for you. This is how:</p>
				<ul><li><p class="docList">Click on the empty cell under the column of numbers (cell A14 in the example), and then click on the <img src="9780131370425_ch04lev1sec9_image04.jpeg" alt="" width="27" height="26"/> tool button. A busy dotted line will appear around the numbers to indicate which <span class="docEmphasis">range</span><a id="the"></a> will be summed. Hit the <span class="docEmphasis">Enter</span> key and the total will magically appear in the selected cell. You probably noticed that the spreadsheet guessed which cells you wanted to add up. You can override this electronic guessing game and use the mouse to select a different range of cells (i.e. move the dotted selection rectangle) before pressing enter.</p></li></ul>
				<p class="docText">All calculations in spreadsheets are called formulas. Once you have planted one, it will quietly watch the numbers it is guarding. If you change so much as one digit in its ambit, the table will update automatically. Try it. Download the sample spreadsheet for this chapter from this book’s website and press F9 a few times.</p>

				</td></tr></table><br/>
				<p class="docText">You are probably ahead of me, and realize that spreadsheets do more than Greek addition. They have several hundred other built-in functions. Yes, several hundred. However, unless you want to do something out of this world, such as plan a NASA expedition to Mars or program a video recorder, you will never use more than a mere handful.</p>
				<a id="ch04note06"></a><div class="docNote">
					<p class="docText">The 123 spreadsheet uses an @ instead of an equals sign to indicate that a formula follows.</p>
					<p class="docText">If you want to type in plain text that starts with an = sign or another reserved character, prefix it with a single quote (as in : ‘= my salary).</p>
				</div><br/>
				<p class="docText">The surprising thing is that even though there are all these built-in functions, the ones you use the most are the ones you create yourself. And to create them, all you need to know is a couple more things. I will demonstrate them with another example:</p>
				<ul><li><p class="docList">Suppose that you want to multiply the value in the top left-hand cell by the one immediately below it. In a third cell of your choosing, type =A1*A2 and press <span class="docEmphasis">Enter</span>. That is all there is to it.</p></li></ul>
				<p class="docText">Why the little star? Because there is no multiplication sign on a standard computer keyboard. Similarly, since there is no division key you indicate this operation with a forward slash: /. Addition and subtraction work as normal: + and −.</p>
				<a id="ch04lev3sec4"></a>
					<h5 id="title-ID0EGOAG" class="docSection3Title">My logic is different</h5>
					<p class="docText">Spreadsheets calculate the answer to a formula by working through the instructions in their own unique way, doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, and so on. This can get fairly confusing. However, spreadsheets also do things in brackets first. If there is more than one set of parentheses, the calculation works from the <span class="docEmphasis">inside</span> outwards. Some examples will help make this clear. If cell A1 contains the value 100:</p>
					<blockquote><p></p><p class="docList">=A1 * 5 + 10 produces the result 510, but</p><p></p><p class="docList">=A1 * (5 + 10) gives the answer 1500.</p></blockquote>
					<a id="ch04note07"></a><div class="docNote">
						<p class="docText">When you have keyed in some coded calculation, the cell contains a <span class="docEmphStrong">formula</span><a id="a"></a>, but displays the result as a <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_454">value</a></b>. In fact, all the characters and numbers you usually see when you view a spreadsheet are values. Click on a cell to see the underlying formula, if there is one. Click and then press F2 to <b><a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_gloss01.html#gloss01_034">audit</a></b> the formula – i.e. to highlight the cells on which it operates.</p>
					</div><br/>
					<p class="docText">Likewise:</p>
					<blockquote><p></p><p class="docList">=A1 * 5 + 10 / 2 generates 505, but</p><p></p><p class="docList">=A1 * (5 + 10) / 2 means that you get 750, and</p><p></p><p class="docList">=A1 * (5 + 10 / 2) results in 1000.</p></blockquote>
					<p class="docText"><a id="iddle1608"></a><a id="iddle2067"></a>Note that you can mix reference to cells (such as A1) <span class="docEmphasis">and</span> constant values (such as 5) <span class="docEmphasis">and</span> built-in functions, such as in the following:</p>
					<blockquote><p></p><p class="docList">=SUM(A1:A10) + A15 + 500 or</p><p></p><p class="docList">=SUM(A1:A10,A15,500)</p></blockquote>
					<p class="docText">Or you can omit cell references completely, as in:</p>
					<blockquote><p></p><p class="docList">= 10 * 5 + 24.</p></blockquote>
					<p class="docText">When I give my electronic friend more-complicated calculations, I tend to ignore its built-in sequence order of arithmetic and <span class="docEmphStrong">always use brackets</span> to indicate the required sequence. I find it easier to read and check later what the code was intended to do.</p>
					<p class="docText">I also switch between the mouse and keyboard depending on the complexity of working out which cell I am referring to. For example, as well as keying the above formulas straight into the cell, you can key = click on cell A1 and then type *5+10. In other words, after an equals sign or an arithmetic operator (+ - * /) the spreadsheet expects a cell reference and it will accept it via a mouse selection or a couple of key strokes.</p>

As a check on the accuracy of your work, always do a similar but easier sum in your head, on a scratch pad, or even in another area of the spreadsheet – and compare the results. For example, when multiplying 138.51 by 0.1135, you can temporarily simplify this to 140 × 0.1. The answer to this latter sum is 14. If your electronic helper produces a result that is significantly different from 14 you know you have made a mistake. Other cross checks are covered elsewhere in this book.</p></td></tr></table></div><br/>
