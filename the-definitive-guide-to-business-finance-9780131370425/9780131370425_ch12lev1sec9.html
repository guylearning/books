			<h3 class="docSection1Title">Conclusion</h3>
			<p class="docText">Careful assessment of quantities (e.g. headcount) and costs by category will give you a good feel for the way that the numbers stack up. Ratios, such as the margins just considered, are very valuable. We will return to these in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch18.html#ch18">Chapter 18</a>. As for how you actually manage spending during the year, we will come on to this in <a class="docLink" href="9780131370425_ch22.html#ch22">Chapter 22</a>. Next, though, I want to revisit sales and the directly associated costs.</p>
