			<p class="docText">This chapter runs through some basics related to analysing and reporting numbers. The aim is to help you enhance your understanding and explanation of what the figures show, which will lead automatically to better reporting. Most people gain an improved picture of the numbers when they see a chart. I will kick off with delightfully simple techniques for creating charts and inserting them in written reports. Then we will look at some ways to summarize and compare figures. All this lays a good foundation on which we will build as we move through this book together.</p>
