Would that life were that simple. As you already know, too much debt can sink the ship. You need at least enough equity capital to weather the cash flow storms.</p>
			<p class="docText">Another issue which I quietly omitted to mention in the previous paragraph is taxation. In general, a company’s tax bill is not affected by dividends, but it is reduced by debt interest payments (which are expensed). This does not affect the relative cost of debt instruments – they all have the same net tax effect. But it does impact on comparison of debt with equity and other financing options such as leasing.</p>

				</td><td valign="top"><p class="docText">Generally, short-term borrowing should be used to finance short-term assets. The logic is inescapable. If you use, say, a bank overdraft or six-month loan to finance the acquisition of a fixed asset, such as a clump press or a factory, you could be in big trouble when the loan expires if it cannot be renewed – or if the terms are considerably more adverse. To a lesser extent, long-term finance should be used with caution for funding near-term cash needs. You would not want to fritter away a loan on short-term benefits if you then had to repay it back for the next 30 years.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/>
