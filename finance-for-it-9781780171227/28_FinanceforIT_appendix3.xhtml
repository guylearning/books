<p class="chapterTitle">A3 PUBLISHED ACCOUNTS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">I explained in the Preface why the terminology of International Financial Reporting Standards has been adopted in this book. This appendix includes, with permission, an example of recently published accounts that comply with those standards. They are the 2011/12 group accounts of Tesco plc, the UK-based supermarket group. As stated in its 2011/12 annual report it is one of the world’s largest retailers, with operations in 14 countries and employing almost 520,000 people.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The main financial statements required by the Standards are reproduced, although in this book we have mostly been concerned with only two of them. They comprise:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>an income statement (profit and loss account) for the period;</li>
<li>a statement of comprehensive income for the period;</li>
<li>a statement of financial position (balance sheet) as at the end of the period;</li>
<li>a statement of changes in equity for the period;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">a statement of cash flows (cash flow statement) for the period.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">I have given the old, and to some people as yet, more familiar names of three of the statements in brackets. These are permitted. Indeed, International Accounting Standard 1 (IAS 1) states that an ‘entity may use titles for the statements other than those used in this Standard’. You will notice that Tesco uses two of the ‘old’ terms. Also, notice that Tesco, like some other retailing groups, has 52-week accounting periods, ending near to the end of February. For most of the time this makes like-for-like comparison easier, although of course every few years there has to be a 53-week ‘catch-up’ period. A brief commentary on each statement follows, with occasional reference to the Tesco numbers.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Figure A3.1 – Income statement (profit and loss account)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This should look familiar (see <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img20">Table 1.11</a>). It shows the income and expenses, and therefore the profit or loss before taking into account the items dealt with in the next paragraph. The ‘bottom line’ is ‘Profit for the year’ (£m2,814). Here too, other terms are permitted. For example, a random selection of English versions of other recent company reports from different countries has yielded ‘Net profit for the year’ and ‘Profit attributable to shareholders’. I think you would agree that all three mean much the same. Notice the requirement to show ‘comparative figures’ that allow easy comparison of ‘this year’ with last.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent2">Figure A3.2 – Statement of comprehensive income</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This shows other gains or losses that might be regarded as being remote from the main activity of the business, such as those resulting from currency exchange or from actuarial revaluations of pension funds. These, added to the ‘Profit for the year’, give the ‘Total comprehensive income for the year’ (£m2,479). Of this, £m2,466 is attributable to the owners (shareholders) of the parent company, the remainder to non-controlling (minority) interests, that is other shareholders in subsidiary companies that are not wholly owned by the parent.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The standards permit the above two statements to be combined into a single ‘Statement of comprehensive income’, showing all of the same information. However, most companies seem to prefer to do as Tesco has done and keep them separate.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img238" src="images/img238.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1459" height="917"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Figure A3.3 – Statement of financial position (balance sheet)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As discussed in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, this shows the assets, liabilities and equity of the company as at the end of its 2011/12 accounting period. The main headings and many of the items within them should be familiar to you (see <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img20">Table 1.11</a>). The main sections are mandatory, but the order in which they are shown is not, although the layout adopted by Tesco might be regarded as typical. For example, in one of the two other sets of accounts already mentioned the last three items are in the sequence: equity, non-current liabilities, current liabilities. Such differences can often be traced to the older national accounting standards of the country in which a company is based.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Figure A3.4 – Statement of changes in equity</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This sets out in detail the various changes in equity from last year (£m16,623 in the rightmost column) to this year (£m17,801) and which, of share capital and the various ‘reserves’, were affected by them. A reserve is anything that is part of equity other than share capital. The most obvious of these is ‘Retained earnings’. Notice that the top half of the rightmost column is an only slightly modified repeat of the statement of comprehensive income, but with the items spread among the various reserves. Notice also that, as might be expected, the main factor decreasing equity is the dividends payable to the shareholders.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img239" src="images/img239.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1183" height="1500"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img240" src="images/img240.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1092" height="1500"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Figure A3.5 – Statement of cash flows (cash flow statement)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This too should look familiar, at least the three main headings (see <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img18">Table 1.9</a>).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In summary, as mentioned in the Preface, the purpose of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is to facilitate the comparison of company accounts (currently mainly published group accounts), both within and between countries. Even with common standards, comparison between countries is only possible if accounts are produced using a common language, and that language is English. You may find it instructive to look on the internet at the published group accounts of some companies in various different countries. If they are countries that have adopted IFRS then you would normally expect to find the accounts, and indeed the entire annual report, available in both the native language and English. Of course there will be differences of detail and, as has been noted above, of sequence, but the fundamental structure will be recognisably the same.
