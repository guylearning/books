<p class="chapterTitle">A5 DEBIT AND CREDIT</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Having got this far in the book, then I believe that you will have understood the essential simplicity of financial concepts, and of accountancy, which is nothing more than the means whereby the application of those concepts is recorded. If so, you will have done so without any mention of the terms ‘debit’ and ‘credit’. However, you might be interested in how those terms came about.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">It happens that in many countries, statements of financial position are today usually set out as described in the early chapters of this book. Assets are shown at the top, liabilities at the bottom, and this is sometimes referred to as the ‘vertical format’. However, in former times, when accounting was done by hand rather than by computer, and possibly in some countries still today, statements of financial position were set out differently, being divided into two columns. Assets were shown on the left-hand side and liabilities on the right: the ‘horizontal format’. The same was true of income statements. Instead of the vertical format often used today, the horizontal format was used for them too. Expenses were shown on the left-hand side and revenues on the right.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">This was all a natural consequence of the way in which, in those days, individual transactions were recorded in a book, often a beautifully bound book, that was called a ‘journal’. For example, the two sides of the transaction representing the sale of goods to J Bloggs for CU10 would have been recorded in the journal of the selling business, inessential details being omitted, as shown in <a href="30_FinanceforIT_appendix5.xhtml#img243">Table A5.1</a>. People to whom goods or services were sold, and who therefore owed a debt to the business (the obligation to pay for them) were called ‘debitors’, different by only one letter from the word often used today. Those to whom a business owed a debt (in this example, the obligation to deliver goods) were called ‘creditors’, as they still are. By convention, the debitors were always shown in the left-hand column, the creditors on the right. Over time, ‘debitor’ and ‘creditor’ became abbreviated to ‘debit’ and ‘credit’, and eventually to ‘dr’ and ‘cr’. Notice from the example that, even in those more leisurely days, the intermediate recording as a ‘creditor’ of the obligation of the seller to actually deliver the goods would have been omitted, the transaction being instead immediately ‘credited’ to sales.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent1">Because the two-column format was obviously a convenient way of recording two-sided transactions, it came to serve as the medium for recording all transactions, not just those involving actual debitors and creditors. So, all assets came to be recorded as ‘debits’, and all liabilities as ‘credits’. It was then only a small step also to use the ‘debit’ column to record expenses (the using up of assets, you will recall) and the ‘credit’ column to record revenues, the money earned when the obligation to actually deliver goods or services had been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Thus it was that generations of finance and accountancy students came to be told that ‘assets and expenses are debits, while liabilities and revenues are credits’. This might possibly have contributed to understanding if it had been explained to those same students that expenses were used-up assets and that revenues represented money earned when a liability (the obligation to deliver) had been fulfilled. Often, there was no such explanation.</p>
