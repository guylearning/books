<p class="chapterTitle">5 HOW FINANCIAL CASES ARE EVALUATED: PART 1</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">This chapter and the one that follows it both cover what is really a single topic: how IT and other investment proposals are evaluated. The reason why the topic has been spread over two chapters is to keep chapters to a reasonable length.</p>

</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">You will no doubt recall the simple car example in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>. One of its purposes, which, in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, we applied in building an IT financial case, was to make clear the need to ensure that only relevant cash flows are attributed to an investment. Another purpose was to show that determining the relevant cash flows is not the end of the financial case but the beginning. The reason, as we discovered, is that the cash numbers by themselves do not tell us the real value of the proposed investment. To find that, we explored the use of discounted cash flow, and specifically net present value (NPV).</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch05-2">PRESENT VALUE REVISITED</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In this chapter, we shall extend our understanding of discounted cash flow and apply its principles to the IT financial case that we built in Example 4.1. We shall try to determine which, financially, is the better of the two possible options in that example: to stay as we are or to adopt the proposed change. As with the car example, we shall only need to work with the total cash numbers. For what we shall discuss in this chapter, although not in the next one, the detail that led to the totals is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">Discounted cash flow, you will recall, allows us to calculate the real values, the ‘present values’, of cash flows occurring at different times, by taking into account the ‘time value of money’. The way it worked in the car example in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> was to discount the cash flows at a rate equal to the ‘cost of money’ of the individual concerned. In that example, we assumed that our only source of money was an overdraft and that the cost of the overdraft, our personal cost of money, was 13 per cent per annum. Thirteen per cent was also, of course, the return expected by the bank, so we could say that our cost of money is equal to the return expected by the provider of that money. This particular way of expressing it will be helpful in what follows. You will also recall that the reason why an overdraft was assumed in the car example was that it gave us the closest parallel with a business situation, because, in a sense, all of a company’s, or any other organisation’s, money is ‘borrowed’.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch05-3">THE COST OF CAPITAL</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The term ‘cost of money’ is also used in business. However, ‘cost of capital’ is a more commonly used term, although it means the same thing. Our personal ‘cost of money’ was fundamental in determining the real costs to us of the two car options. It was the basis of the discount rate that we used in discounting the cash flows, and it was easy to work out. For the same reasons, a company’s cost of capital is fundamental in determining the real costs and benefits to the company of any investment, in IT or anything else, that it may make.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">So, the cost of capital is also the basis of the discount rate used by a company in discounted cash flow calculations. The difference is that working out a company’s cost of capital can be rather more complicated. Furthermore, the detailed arguments to support the calculations are lengthy. For these reasons, this is one thing in the book that I will concede as belonging in ‘deep finance’ territory. In practice, the finance department or finance person in a company would be expected to provide guidance on what discount rate to use in NPV calculations. However, the following paragraphs give a summary of the main principles.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In order to work out a company’s cost of capital, it is first necessary to know what its capital consists of. In most companies it consists of two elements: money belonging to shareholders (‘equity’, which is share capital plus reserves) and money lent by lenders (‘borrowings’ or ‘debt’). The cost of a loan, the ‘return required by the lender’, is known. It is the periodic rate of interest charged. The complicated part is the cost of equity, the ‘return required by shareholders’, but a starting point is to ask why people invest in shares and how they get their ‘return’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Cost of equity</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Shareholders, at least those in companies quoted on a stock exchange, get their return in one or both of two ways: by dividends or capital growth. Capital growth means an increase in the market price of the share; dividends are periodic payments, usually made once or twice a year, out of profit. Dividends, however, are not compulsory, and capital growth is not certain; indeed, it may be negative. It depends on market expectations of the company’s future performance, but that in turn depends on unpredictable ‘systematic risk’ factors in the economy, such as interest and taxation rates and consumer demand. So, shares in general are a more risky investment than, say, Government bonds, on which the return, at least in sound economic times, is certain.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Business, and investment in business, is about risk and reward. The greater the risk, the higher the expected reward. So, investors usually expect a higher return from shares in general than from Government bonds. They also expect a higher return from shares in volatile industries than from those in more stable ones.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Cost of debt</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Lenders to a company will usually be prepared to accept a lower return than shareholders, because lending is less risky. There are two reasons for this. First, payment of interest on a loan is compulsory, while dividends are not. Second, lenders have more security than do shareholders. They have a higher priority for getting paid when a company is wound up, so they stand more chance of getting their money back should it fail.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch05-4">WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (WACC)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">So, what is a particular company’s cost of capital? It is a combination of its cost of equity and its cost of debt. If there were equal quantities of equity and debt, then the cost of capital would be the average of the two. Because the respective quantities are usually unequal, a weighted average is required. So, a company’s cost of capital is the weighted average of its costs of equity and debt. The following example illustrates the calculation and introduces the effect of tax.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Let us assume for simplicity that a company has CU3 million of equity and CU1 million of debt. The total capital employed is therefore CU4 million. Suppose that the ‘cost of equity’ is 12 per cent per annum and the cost of debt eight per cent. What is the company’s current ‘cost of capital’? The calculation is as follows:</p>
<p class="paraCenter"><span class="no-style-override-7">(3 / 4 × 12) + (1 / 4 × 8) = 9 + 2 = 11%</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Therefore the basis of the discount rate used by this particular company in discounted cash flow calculations would be 11 per cent, but only if the company ignores tax in such calculations. Dividends are paid out of already-taxed profit. Interest on business loans, however, unlike interest on personal loans, is usually an expense deductible in arriving at profit. Therefore, the true cost of loan interest is not its gross cost but its net-of-tax cost. If the tax rate paid by the above company is, for example, 30 per cent, then the net-of-tax cost is not eight per cent but 5.6 per cent. To arrive at the after-tax cost of capital, the above calculation would be restated as follows:</p>
<p class="paraCenter"><span class="no-style-override-7">(3 / 4 × 12) + (1 / 4 × 5.6) = 9 + 1.4 = 10.4%</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Not all organisations are taxable and not all businesses take tax into account in investment evaluations. However, many do, and that is why a chapter on tax (<a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>) is included in the book. Until we reach that point, all our evaluations will be done on a before-tax basis. That means that we shall be evaluating before-tax cash flows using before-tax discount rates. In the above example, that would mean using 11 per cent as the discount rate, not 10.4 per cent.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">A company’s weighted average cost of capital, whether before or after tax, represents the average return expected by all the providers of that capital. It follows that any discretionary investment (for example an IT investment) had better provide a return at least slightly greater than the cost of capital if it is to be worthwhile. That is why cost of capital is the basis of the discount rate used in business NPV calculations. I say ‘the basis of the discount rate’ because, as we shall see later in this chapter, some companies make adjustments to it as one way of reflecting the different risk of different investments. This ‘project risk’ is quite different from the risk inherent in shares, discussed above. The latter, sometimes called ‘systematic risk’, is taken into account in working out the cost of the equity component in the cost of capital.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The effects of time</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The cost of capital will change over time. Old loans will be paid off and new ones taken out. More shares may be issued or shares may be bought back by companies with surplus cash. Market expectations of the return required from shares generally will change in line with changes to market interest rates and other economic factors. Expectations of the return required from particular shares may change as views of their risk change.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Should these expected variations not be taken into account in evaluations (such as NPV evaluations) that involve the cost of capital? In theory, yes. In practice, however, especially over the relatively short evaluation periods chosen for most IT projects, they are nearly always ignored. Today’s cost of capital, and the discount rate derived from it, is usually deemed to apply for the whole period of the evaluation.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch05-5">APPLYING PRESENT VALUES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">We are now in a position to work out the net present value (NPV) of the investment whose cash flows we estimated in Example 4.1. In doing so, we shall assume that the before-tax discount rate to be applied to the cash flows is 10 per cent. This is chosen purely to be a convenient number to work with. <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img75-1">Table 5.1</a> shows the answer. If you wish to work it out for yourself, then use the discount table called <a href="26_FinanceforIT_appendix1.xhtml#img230">Table A1.1</a> in <a href="26_FinanceforIT_appendix1.xhtml">Appendix 1</a>. Referring to the discount table, simply look up the 10 per cent discount factors for one, two, three and four years respectively. Enter them in the appropriate columns and then multiply the cash flows by the discount factors to arrive at the present values for each year. Finally, add all the present values to arrive at the ‘net present value’ to go into the total column. <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img75-2">Figure 5.1</a> shows the discounted cash flows diagrammatically.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img75-1" src="images/img75-1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1454" height="731"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img75-2" src="images/img75-2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="933"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">A common mistake in doing these calculations is to forget that ‘Year 0’ is taken as meaning ‘today’, in respect of which the discount factor is of course 1.0. It is only future cash flows that are discounted. Remember that the term ‘net present value’ (NPV) is used because it refers to the sum of a series of individual present values, some of which are positive and some negative.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">What does the answer mean?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As with the car example, we need to ask what the NPV of CU75,180 actually means. Remember that in the car example we had produced a ‘cost case’. We were only considering the net costs of the alternative courses of action. In the ‘whole project’ approach, therefore, we were looking for the alternative that yielded the smallest negative NPV. This told us which alternative had the lowest cost in real terms. Using the incremental approach, a positive incremental NPV meant that, by comparison with continuing as we were, the proposed alternative was cheaper in real terms.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">When looking at business investments, however, as distinct from personal ones, we have already discussed the need to take into account not just costs but benefits also. So, rather than looking for the alternative that yields the smallest negative NPV we should be looking for the one that yields the largest positive NPV. Using the incremental approach, a positive NPV, as in <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img75-1">Table 5.1</a>, means that, compared with continuing as we are, the proposed alternative is more beneficial in real terms. In fact, in using the incremental approach, a positive NPV, however small, always indicates that in real terms the proposed change is preferable, at least in theory, to the ‘stay as we are’ option.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Another way of expressing the answer in <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img75-1">Table 5.1</a> is to say that by undertaking the proposed project we should be better off by CU75,180 after taking into account the cost of the money invested in it. Here is yet another way of expressing the answer: if, as in this example, a positive value remains after discounting the cash flows at the cost of capital, it must mean that the percentage return yielded by the investment must be greater than the cost of the capital invested. If the NPV had been negative, then it would mean that the percentage return is less than the cost of capital, and the business would be worse off as a result. How to establish exactly what that percentage ‘rate of return’ is will be considered later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Finally, suppose that there is one other investment (Project B) under consideration besides ours (Project A), of roughly similar amount, size and risk to ours. Suppose also that the two investments are mutually exclusive, that is they are both competing for the same limited funds. As an IT example in real life, this situation might represent proposals for a required solution being tendered by different suppliers. Suppose Project B, when compared incrementally to ‘staying as we are’, yields a positive NPV of CU130k. If we are otherwise indifferent to which approach to adopt, then the numbers suggest that Project B should be undertaken rather than Project A (NPV CU75,180). This is because for a roughly similar investment it yields a higher positive NPV.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Decisions are made by people, not by financial models. In making decisions, people take into account many things, including, but not limited to, the ‘advice’ suggested by financial models. Nevertheless, in IT decisions the financial numbers are often an important factor in the decision-making and may sometimes be decisive. Therefore, we need to be sure that we understand exactly what it is that a particular result is telling us. From what has just been discussed it is possible to formulate what we might call the ‘NPV decision rule’. It is as follows.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch05-6">THE NPV DECISION RULE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">If the estimated cash flows of an investment are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital, then:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>if the resulting NPV is positive, by however small an amount, then the proposed investment is, in theory, worthwhile, because it would yield in real terms more than the money invested in it;</li>
<li>if the resulting NPV is negative, by however small an amount, then the proposed investment is not worthwhile, because it would yield in real terms less than the money invested in it;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">if several mutually exclusive investments of similar kind, size and level of risk are competing for the same funds then the best option from a purely financial viewpoint is the one that yields the largest positive NPV.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch05-7">PROFITABILITY INDEX</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Now suppose that we are evaluating two or more mutually exclusive projects of dissimilar size, exclusive either because of limited funds or because of the nature of the situation. An example would be the typical IT situation in which two or more suppliers are responding to a request to provide quotations for a particular IT solution. Suppose that ‘our’ project (Example 4.1), with its NPV of approximately CU75k, represents one such project, and that a competing one, when all of its estimated cash flows are taken into account, gives an expected NPV of CU80k. If all non-financial considerations between the two situations were regarded as equal, then which of the two should be accepted? The answer, at first glance, is the one that has the highest positive NPV. However, suppose that the initial investments required by the two alternatives, and their expected returns, were substantially different. Would it not be better to use a measure that indicated which project would generate most money from each CU spent? Such a ‘profitability index’ is sometimes used. The profitability index (PI) is usually taken as the total present value of the future net cash flows of a project (all the PVs except Year 0), divided by the present value of the net initial (Year 0) investment.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img78">Table 5.2</a> shows our project as Project A, with its NPV of CU75.18k and its net initial investment of CU560k. The present value of its future net cash flows is CU635.18k. Its profitability index would be (635/560 =) 113 per cent, or 1.13 if you prefer. Suppose the figures for Project B to be as stated in <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img78">Table 5.2</a>. Although its NPV of CU80k is indeed higher than that of Project A, its profitability index is lower, at 110, or 1.10, so it yields slightly less in terms of return per CU invested. Since Project A has, marginally, the higher profitability index, it should, other things being the same, be accepted rather than the alternative. Profitability index is a way of using the powerful NPV concept to compare the real values of projects of different magnitudes.</p>

<div class="box">
<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText2">So far in this chapter, we have covered the following factors relating to its first three objectives:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">We have looked in more detail at the concept of net present value (NPV), first considered in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">We have defined ‘cost of capital’ and discussed its significance in investment evaluations.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">We have discussed risk and reward, and why investors usually require a higher return from shares than from, say, Government bonds.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">We have derived an ‘NPV decision rule’ to help interpret NPV results.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">We have discussed ‘profitability index’ as a way of deriving a measure of profitability from NPV results.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch05-8"><span class="no-style-override">INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (IRR)</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Net present value (NPV) is only one side of the coin called ‘discounted cash flow’. We can now look at the other side of that coin.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">We have just noted that if a positive value remains after discounting the cash flows of an investment at the cost of the capital invested, then it must mean that the percentage ‘return’ yielded by the cash flows must be greater than that cost of capital. However, we left open the question of exactly what that percentage return is and how it is calculated. It is called ‘internal rate of return (IRR)’. We shall look at the question of how it is calculated shortly, but before doing so we shall look at a very simple example that illustrates the concept of IRR.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Suppose that you deposit CU100 in a bank today. Suppose also that you have no idea what rate of interest the bank is paying. A year from today you discover that the balance of your account is CU105, at which point you withdraw all the money and close the account. What is the rate of interest earned by your investment during the year? The answer is obviously five per cent. If the balance on the account were CU107 the rate of interest earned would have been seven per cent; if the balance were CU115 the rate of interest would have been 15 per cent, and so on.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">A miniature ‘project’</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Let us now think of that example as though it were a miniature ‘project’. The only ‘cost’ is the investment of the CU100; the only ‘benefit’ is the receipt of the CU105 exactly one year later. If the CU100 is your only supply of money, and if (despite your apparent indifference) the rate of interest of five per cent were in fact the best rate obtainable at that time, then the opportunity cost of money invested in the bank was five per cent per annum. (Recall, from <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, that for a cash-rich individual, it is that person’s opportunity cost of money that is the appropriate discount rate to use in NPV calculations – the cost of the best alternative forgone in order to make the investment.) Let us now set out a statement of the cash flows of the ‘project’ and then discount them at the opportunity cost of money in order to work out their net present value. <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img79">Table 5.3</a> gives the answer.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img79" src="images/img79.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="698"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">You will not, I think, be surprised to find that the NPV of the ‘project’ is zero. Discounted at the cost of money, the cash outflow exactly equals the cash inflow. Furthermore, I think you will agree that, whatever the interest rate assumed, if the cash flows of the above project are discounted at that same rate, then its net present will always be zero.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">An NPV of zero means that the discounted value of the benefits of an investment is exactly equal and opposite to the discounted value of its costs. However, we have, I think, agreed that the discount rate that gives that NPV of zero represents the rate of interest earned by the investment. Let us now shorten that last phrase. If we change ‘rate of interest earned by the investment’ to ‘internal rate of return’ then we have an explanation of what that commonly used term actually means.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The above ‘project’ was trivial. However, what is true for one investment is true for others, even though the cash flows would be more varied. We are now able to state a definition of internal rate of return (IRR) as follows: the internal rate of return of a series of positive and negative cash flows is represented by the discount rate that, when applied to them, yields an NPV of zero. Note that the concept of IRR requires at least one negative initial cash flow – an ‘investment’. If there is no investment, it means that any percentage ‘return’ is infinite. Thus, not all IT investments are suitable for IRR analysis, as we shall see later in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> when considering a typical outsourcing decision. This is a limitation of IRR that does not apply to NPV.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Earlier in this chapter I conceded that one particular topic – how to calculate a company’s cost of capital – is a matter that can justifiably be left to people in deep finance. I shall now concede that one other topic – how to calculate internal rate of return mathematically – is a matter that can justifiably be left to people in deep mathematics. Such people tell me, and I am happy to believe them, that it is all a question of solving polynomial equations. I think that most readers will not feel unduly insulted if I continue the explanation of IRR as though you, like me, are not entirely at home with polynomial equations.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Fortunately, it does not matter much, for two reasons. One is that modern spreadsheets, which most people use for tasks such as investment evaluation, have IRR and NPV functions built in. So do many financial calculators. The second reason is that, with a knowledge of NPV it is, as we shall see, a simple matter to derive a reasonable approximation to the IRR of any given set of cash flows.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">How to derive IRR</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Please refer back to <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img75-1">Table 5.1</a>. Discounting the cash flows at 10 per cent gave us an NPV of roughly CU75k. What do you think would happen to the NPV of the cash flows if we were to apply a much higher discount rate, say 24 per cent? <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img80">Table 5.4</a> shows the answer.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img80" src="images/img80.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="586"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Even without looking at the answer, the clue lies in the word ‘discount’. In everyday life discount implies something – a price – getting smaller. The higher the discount the lower the price. For our current purpose discount also implies something – the real value of cash flows – getting smaller. The higher the discount rate, the smaller the NPV; so much smaller in this case that it has gone negative. It is now roughly −CU75k. This suggests the method that we might use to work out a reasonable approximation of IRR. Although the relationship of discount rate to NPV is not a straight-line one, it is nearly so at normally encountered discount rates.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Remember that the internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that gives an NPV of exactly zero. So the question is ‘if a discount rate of 10 per cent gives an NPV of +CU75k and a rate of 24 per cent gives an NPV of −CU75k, what discount rate, approximately, will give an NPV of zero?’ If we were to assume a linear relationship, then the answer would be approximately 17 per cent (the rate that lies midway between 10 per cent and 24 per cent). In <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img81">Figure 5.2</a> the true NPVs of our cash flows for all discount rates between 10 per cent and 24 per cent are plotted against the straight-line approximation. From this graph you can see that the true IRR is actually 16.2 per cent. The approximation of 17 per cent would usually be regarded as accurate enough.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">How is IRR used?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The first question is ‘is the IRR greater than the discount rate that would be applied to NPV calculations?’ If it is not, then this would mean that the return from the investment would be less than the cost of the capital invested in it. If it is, as in this case, then another test will usually be applied.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img81" src="images/img81.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1455" height="987"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Organisations will, over time, accumulate experience of the IRR typical of investments of a particular kind, size and level of risk that they have undertaken. They will regard this as a yardstick or ‘hurdle rate’ for future investments. If the current hurdle rate for investments like ours is, say, 26 per cent, then ours, with its IRR of approximately 16 per cent, may not stand much of a chance, unless there are important factors of a non-financial nature to be taken into account. We should have to try to find ways of improving it. An IRR less than the hurdle rate may cause an investment to be rejected, even though the IRR is greater than the cost of capital.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Which is better: a bank account that pays interest at five per cent (has an ‘internal rate of return’ of five per cent) or one that pays interest at seven per cent? The one that pays the higher interest rate, of course – the one that has the higher ‘internal rate of return’. The same principle applies to any investment, including one in IT. In comparing two similarly sized investments, the one more likely to be chosen would be the one that shows the higher IRR. However, the restriction to ‘similarly sized investments’ was deliberate. Compare the following two proposals:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7"> Project A   IRR 20%</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7"> Project B   IRR 1943%</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">From a comparison of the IRRs, Project B would appear to be the more attractive by an overwhelming margin. However, a percentage by itself gives no indication of the relative sizes of the projects being compared. Remembering that NPVs are absolute numbers, suppose for example that the NPVs of the above projects are as follows:</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7"> Project A   NPV CU2.59 million</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7"> Project B   NPV CU18.5k</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Project A is a proposal for a major network to improve the company’s countrywide distribution system, while Project B is a proposal to reorganise the IT supplies store. Which is now the more worthwhile?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">That was a ridiculously exaggerated example to make the point that reliance on percentage returns can be misleading. But therein lies what some people regard as the weakness of IRR: that it is a percentage. Others regard IRR as useful precisely because it gives a percentage result. Business people are used to results expressed as percentages. However, it would usually be wise to look at NPVs as well as IRRs as part of the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">It is now possible to formulate what we can call the ‘IRR decision rule’, which is as follows.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch05-9">THE IRR DECISION RULE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The internal rate of return (IRR) of a proposed investment is the discount rate that, applied to its estimated cash flows, yields an NPV of exactly zero.</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-7">If the IRR is greater than the company’s cost of capital, by however small a margin, then the proposed investment is, in theory, worthwhile because it would yield in real terms more than the required return on the money invested in it.</span></li>
<li>If the IRR is less than the company’s cost of capital, by however small a margin, then the proposed investment is not worthwhile, because it would yield in real terms less than the required return on the money invested in it.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">If several mutually exclusive investments of roughly similar size are competing for the same funds, then, other things being equal, the best option financially is the one that yields the largest positive IRR.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">NPV and IRR contrasted</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">It was asserted earlier that NPV and IRR are the two sides of one coin: discounted cash flow. It should now be clear that this is indeed the case. Here is a summary that highlights the contrast between the two:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Net present value (NPV) is the absolute number obtained by applying a discount rate, usually equal to, or based on, the weighted average cost of capital, to a series of cash flows.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that, when applied to a series of cash flows, both positive and negative, yields an NPV of exactly zero.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">While they are indeed two sides of the same coin, IRR has some practical limitations that NPV does not. These are as follows:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-7">IRR requires an initial cash outflow (an ‘investment’) in order to give a meaningful result; NPV does not.</span></li>
<li>IRR gives a percentage result that, if not considered in the context of the size of an investment, can lead to misinterpretation; NPV is expressed as an absolute number, so the problem does not arise.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Not so far considered is the fact that if, in a series of cash flows, the sign of the cumulative sum changes more than once, IRR will give multiple answers. This is because of the mathematics on which it is based. There is no such problem with NPV.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch05-10">NPV, IRR AND RISK</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">Earlier, we discussed why the discount rate used in NPV calculations for investment evaluation is usually the company’s weighted average cost of capital, or at least a value based on it. You will no doubt recall the fundamental reason for this. If the investment is the only one being considered, then a positive NPV means that we should be better off undertaking it than not doing so. A negative NPV says the reverse and the investment should not be undertaken. If we are comparing several similarly sized mutually exclusive investments, then the one that yields the largest positive NPV is the most desirable from a financial viewpoint. However, it may be that some investments being proposed are more risky, and therefore more uncertain in their outcome, than others. They would no doubt be subjected to sensitivity analysis and possibly other risk assessment methods. Dixon (1994) gives good descriptions, with examples, of the many methods of dealing with risk and uncertainty. The question is how, if at all, can discounted cash flow be used to take into account the relatively greater risk and uncertainty of one investment over another?</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Please look again at <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img81">Figure 5.2</a>. It shows how, for investments whose cash inflows exceed their cash outflows, the NPV decreases, and eventually goes negative, as the discount rate increases. This should provide a clue as to how a variation on the discounted cash flow theme is sometimes used to take project risk into account. Another clue is to remind ourselves that with most projects it is the benefits that get discounted most, because they usually occur later in time than the costs. The answer is that, in using NPV to evaluate investments, some organisations apply a discount rate higher than the weighted average cost of capital. How much higher depends upon the perceived level of project risk.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Levels of risk</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Suppose that an organisation has defined three categories of IT investment depending on their perceived level of risk, as shown in <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img84-1">Table 5.5</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Assessing this kind of risk can, of course, only be arbitrary. <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img84-2">Table 5.6</a> shows examples of the kind of discount rates that might be used in working out the NPVs of investment cash flows.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img84-1" src="images/img84-1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="449"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img84-2" src="images/img84-2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1449" height="439"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Suppose that this kind of approach were to be adopted in the case of our proposed investment in Example 4.1. If this were indeed the case then, by reading from the graph in <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img81">Figure 5.2</a>, the NPV of that proposed investment would be one of those in <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img85">Table 5.7</a>, depending upon which risk category it had been placed in.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img85" src="images/img85.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="451"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">You will probably agree that only if classified as ‘Category 1’ would our particular proposal stand any chance of being undertaken. Note that the IRR would remain the same in all categories; that is decided once and for all by the arithmetic of the cash flows. The way IRR is sometimes used to reflect project risk is to impose higher hurdle rates for riskier investments. The higher the risk, the higher the required return.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Disadvantages of inflated discount rates</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Inflating discount rates is certainly a simple way of adapting the NPV method to reflect the perceived project risk of a proposed investment, and it is quite often done. However, the approach is open to some fairly serious objections. You might find it worthwhile to pause at this point to think what they might be.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">First, using the same inflated discount rate for all the cash flows assumes that they are all equally risky. This is most unlikely to be the case. Second, recall that for convenience we usually perform the calculations on net total cash flows. This means that the numbers we are using are in fact net totals of benefits and costs. Discounting means making numbers smaller. Making the benefits smaller by using a higher discount rate may make sense: that is precisely why we are using the inflated discount rate. But does it make sense also to make the costs smaller? It does not. The risk with costs is of an overrun, so if we want to reflect this we should be inflating the costs, not discounting them.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">These are serious criticisms. However, it remains true that the method is quite widely used. As with most things in finance, the important thing is to be consistent. It is also important that people producing and interpreting the results should understand clearly what the numbers are telling them.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">‘Certainty equivalents’</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Rather than using risk-adjusted discount rates, some organisations approach the matter of project risk by applying ‘certainty equivalents’ or ‘confidence factors’ to the benefits (the cash inflows) before doing the NPV calculation. The cash flows having been individually ‘risk-adjusted’, the NPV calculations are then done using as a discount rate the unadjusted weighted average cost of capital.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1" id="cate">In the previous example, all cash inflows in Category 1 investments might be reduced by, say, five per cent; those in Category 2 by 15 per cent and those in Category 3 by 25 per cent. The percentages applied are purely subjective, but then so are most of the cash flow estimates themselves. While it has the merit of simplicity, the method is rather a blunt instrument. Also, a predictable action of the sponsor of a proposal might be to try to inflate the cash inflows, knowing that they are subsequently going to be reduced.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Slightly less blunt is to apply different factors to the cash inflows in different years. For example, in a <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#cate">Category 2</a> investment (see above) the reduction applied to cash inflows in Years 1 to 4 might be, respectively, zero per cent, five per cent, 12 per cent and 20 per cent. Less blunt still might be to examine each significant cash flow and apply an individual factor to it.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The resulting reduction in benefits, by whatever method achieved, would of course produce a lower NPV and a lower IRR and would make the investment less attractive. To the perfectly reasonable argument that this is all purely subjective, I would respond that so is the inflation of the discount rate to an arbitrary figure that is then applied to all the cash flows. At least the idea of ‘certainty equivalents’ makes some attempt at assessing the risks associated with particular cash flows occurring at particular times.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">More art than science</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Finally, let us remind ourselves that every single number in a cash flow estimate is exactly that: an estimate. As somebody said, forecasting is notoriously difficult, especially when it concerns the future. Furthermore, all the evaluation tools described here and in the next chapter have imperfections and require certain assumptions to be made. As with much of finance, the whole of this subject is more art than science. I repeat that in order to achieve something that is in any way helpful to decision-making the two main requirements are consistency and a clear understanding of what the results of any particular method, imperfect though it may be, are telling us.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The assertion that what we are considering is more art than science is in fact unfair to one of the techniques that we have considered, namely NPV. NPV is strictly mathematical and unambiguous. Any wrongness can only arise either from non-cash flows or non-relevant cash flows having been included in the numbers to be analysed. IRR, as we discussed earlier, although also mathematical, can nevertheless be ambiguous by, for example, giving multiple results.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The other evaluation methods, to be considered in the next chapter, are both useful and widely used. However, with the exception of ‘shareholder value added’ (SVA) they do not have the mathematical rigour of discounted cash flow. In the case of one of them (‘payback’) the method does not necessarily consider all the cash flows involved; in the case of another (‘return on investment’ or ‘accounting rate of return’) the method uses accounting numbers that are usually not exclusively cash flows. <span class="no-style-override-7">There is a lot of number work in this chapter and in the next one. To help you keep track of it, at the end of the next chapter you will find a summary of all the evaluation methods (<a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img105">Table 6.10</a>), a summary of relevant totals and other extracts from the various tables of Example 4.1 (<a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img106">Table 6.11</a>) and a summary of all the evaluation results from Example 4.1 (<a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img107">Table 6.12</a>). You may find it useful to glance at those three tables now to the extent that they summarise what has already been covered in this chapter.</span></p>
<div class="box" id="ch05-11">
<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="boxText2">The main points covered in this chapter, linked to its objectives, have been the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">The two ‘discounted cash flow’ methods of investment evaluation are net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR).</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">NPV is the absolute number obtained by discounting a series of cash flows at a rate equal to or based on a company’s weighted average cost of capital. A positive NPV suggests that, in theory at least, a proposed investment is worth making; a negative NPV suggests the converse.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">IRR is the percentage rate of return implicit in an investment. It is the discount rate that, applied to the investment cash flows, yields an NPV of zero. An IRR greater than the cost of capital suggests that, in theory at least, the proposed investment is worth undertaking; an IRR less than the cost of capital suggests the converse. An investment with an IRR greater than the cost of capital may still have to meet a company-imposed ‘hurdle rate’.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">‘Profitability index’ is a way of deriving a measure of profitability from NPV results.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">A company’s cost of capital is the return required by the providers of the capital. It is usually the weighted average of the cost of equity and the cost of debt. Using it in NPV calculations gives a result that shows whether the investment yields an amount greater or less than the cost of the capital invested.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">‘Systematic risk’ is a term used to describe those unpredictable aspects of the economy as a whole, such as interest rates, tax rates and consumer demand, that usually make shares a more risky investment than, say, Government bonds. It is taken into account in calculating the cost of equity.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">‘Project risk’ refers to the fact that some investments or projects are more risky than others. It is sometimes taken into account by adjusting the cash flows or by applying an inflated discount rate in the NPV calculation. The latter approach can, however, give misleading results.</span></li>
