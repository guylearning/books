<p class="paraNoIndent1">In the previous chapter we explored the application of discounted cash flow methods to the evaluation of IT, and other, financial cases. At the end of this one we shall look at a method (SVA) that at its simplest can be thought of as a variation of NPV. However, before doing so we shall discuss some other widely-used methods. The methods are payback and return on investment (ROI), also known as ‘accounting rate of return’ (ARR) or ‘return on capital employed’ (ROCE). We shall continue in this chapter to use the output from Example 4.1 for the purpose of illustration, in particular <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a>.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch06-2">PAYBACK</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Payback is an almost universally used evaluation method. This is because it is both simple and rooted in common sense. It is also known as ‘break-even’, and the question it seeks to answer is very simple: how soon would we get our money back if we put it into this particular investment?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">What is the payback of the financial case in Example 4.1? While not the most demanding of the things that I invite you to do in this book, you may nevertheless like to work it out for yourself. The usual assumptions are that the initial investment is made on the last day of Year 0 and that benefits accrue evenly throughout each year. The answer is shown in <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img89">Table 6.1</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img90">Figure 6.1</a> shows the now familiar diagram of this investment, with the break-even point marked on it.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img89" src="images/img89.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1200" height="1169"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Some organisations use payback as a filter in order to weed out investments not regarded as worthy of further consideration. This is often done where more investment proposals are put forward than there are funds with which to undertake them. If a proposal passes the payback test by breaking even within the company’s current ‘hurdle period’, then it may be subjected to some or all of the other evaluation methods. If not, it may be rejected out of hand. As an example, if investments of similar type, size and risk have typically paid back within 15 months, then ours, with a payback of nearly 30 months would not stand much of a chance unless the payback could be substantially improved. The simple expedient of using leasing to spread the payments can often bring forward the payback of an investment.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img90" src="images/img90.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="935"/></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch06-3">PAYBACK AND RISK</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The payback question – how soon will we get our money back? – is one that we as individuals would ask almost instinctively if invited by a friend to put money into some ‘little earner’ that they had in mind, such as (perhaps) producing and selling the new jelly-slicer that the world has been waiting for. Why is this? The reason is associated with the idea of risk and uncertainty. Most of us, if we have any spare cash, put it into something that we believe to be reasonably safe. Most of us are, as the jargon has it, risk-averse.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In the previous chapter we looked at an example that categorised IT investments into three levels of project risk. A straight technology replacement proposal, with new but proven technology from the same trusted supplier, and with no change to existing applications, might be regarded as low risk. Undertaking a new application, one that is new for us but that has been available for years and used successfully by many organisations like ours, might be regarded as medium risk but still reasonably safe. However, what about being one of the first organisations to invest in a completely new application, using new technology and never before tried in our industry? That is perhaps rather closer to the jelly-slicer in terms of risk.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Suppose the jelly-slicing friend managed to convince you that after six months you would get your money back and that from then on it would be pure profit all the way? You might think that not too much could go wrong in six months. You might also think that for the prospect of returns from the investment for many years into the future, such risks as there are would be worth taking. Furthermore, until the promised profits start pouring in you would only be losing six months‘ worth of interest on your money.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">However, suppose the payback estimate is not six months, but five years? A lot more can go wrong in five years than can go wrong in six months, and you would be losing five years’ worth of interest meanwhile, not six months’, so the eventual returns would have to be greater to compensate for that. In an unscientific but common sense way, payback gives an indication of the risk and uncertainty associated with a proposed investment.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Criticisms of payback</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">However, this example highlights one of the more obvious dangers of the payback method. If used slavishly, substantial cash inflows after the break-even point may be ignored. Suppose that our investment’s estimated cash flows were not as in <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img90">Figure 6.1</a> but as in <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img91">Figure 6.2</a>. The payback period of the two investments is the same. However, the latter is obviously a more attractive investment. Slavish use of payback could cause the difference to be ignored.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img91" src="images/img91.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="936"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">A more serious criticism of the payback method, at least in its basic form, is that it ignores what, in earlier chapters, we have come to know as the ‘time value of money’. From those earlier examples we know that, while the initial net cash outflows can be taken at face value because they are paid ‘today’, the subsequent benefits cannot. They are worth less than face value, and the later they are received the less, proportionally, are they worth in real terms. <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img75-2">Figure 5.1</a> illustrated the point.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch06-4">DISCOUNTED PAYBACK</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In the light of the last-mentioned weakness, it may have occurred to you that payback is just as capable of being applied to discounted as to undiscounted cash flows. Try it yourself, using the present values that we derived in the last chapter (<a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img75-1">Table 5.1</a>). <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img92">Table 6.2</a> gives the answer, using exactly the same approach that was used earlier in <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img89">Table 6.1</a>. <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img93">Figure 6.3</a> shows the answer diagrammatically.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img92" src="images/img92.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1200" height="1181"/></p>

<div class="box">
<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText2">So far in this chapter we have discussed payback. Most organisations use payback. Its advantages are:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">it is simple;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">it gives a common sense indication of the risk associated with a proposed investment;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">it can provide a yardstick or ‘hurdle’, based on experience, against which investments of similar type can be evaluated;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">it can be a useful filter for weeding out unsuitable investments with relatively little effort.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="box-text box-text-override"><span class="no-style-override-1">The disadvantages of payback are:</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">used slavishly, it may cause substantial cash flows, positive or negative, beyond the break-even point to be ignored in the evaluation process;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">in its basic form, payback ignores the time value of money. This drawback can be mitigated by applying the payback method to discounted cash flows.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch06-5"><span class="no-style-override">RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI)</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In discussing ROI one thing is almost certain. That is that the particular methods that I describe will not be exactly the same as the one used by your organisation. This is because, unlike discounted cash flow and payback, there are many different possible ways of doing ROI calculations; there are no textbook rules. The explanations of ROI offered here should, however, be sufficient to help you understand the particular approach that your organisation uses.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">All the evaluation methods so far considered have been based exclusively on cash flow. Many of the numbers used in ROI calculations are also usually cash flows – but not all of them. The reason why most of them are the same is that, for the sake of simplicity, timing differences are usually ignored. By this I mean mainly the timing differences that occur between selling goods or services and getting paid; also between receiving goods or services and paying for them.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The reason why not all the numbers in ROI calculations are necessarily the same as cash flows is that ROI deals with accounting profit, which explains one of its alternative names: ‘accounting rate of return’ (ARR). We have already, in <a href="15_FinanceforIT_chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, considered the fact that, by contrast with cash flow, profit is to some extent a matter of opinion. We looked at two examples that illustrated the point: depreciation and the valuation of inventory.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Opinion it may be, but profit is an important opinion. It is the main basis for reporting business results and being assessed for tax. It is often also the basis for determining department, division or branch performance and for calculating performance-related bonuses. Therefore, it is desirable to know the effect on profit if a particular investment decision is to be taken. For this purpose, ROI is still the most widely used method. As we shall discover, however, it can be more complicated than the cash flow-based methods considered so far.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">What is ROI?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">ROI expresses the profit generated by an investment (in IT, for example) as a percentage of the capital (the financial resources) employed in it. What are we putting into the investment, and what will we get out of it? This is an identical question to the one implied by the financial ratio ‘return on capital employed’ (ROCE), regarded as a key measure of business activity. The only difference is that ROCE applies to the business as a whole, whereas ROI as we are now discussing it applies to an investment that is a subset of the business.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">A business can indeed be viewed as a continuing series of investments, some large, some small, each of which uses a part of the business’s capital. If the business as a whole is to be profitable, then these individual investments had better be profitable too. It is the profitability of an investment that ROI sets out to measure. It is the similarity of approach to measuring the profitability of a business and of an investment that no doubt led to the term ‘return on capital employed’ being sometimes used synonymously with ROI. As already noted, its other alternative name, ‘accounting rate of return’, reflects the fact that the method uses accounting numbers rather than exclusively cash flows. For the rest of this chapter we shall use the term ROI to embrace all three names.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Which profit, what capital employed?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">So, the questions are ‘what capital will be employed in the investment?’ and ‘what profit will it make?’ Simple questions, but immediately they cause a problem and lead to two more questions: ‘what do we mean by capital employed?’ and ‘what do we mean by profit?’</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In using return on capital employed (ROCE) to measure the profitability of a business the problem does not arise. This is because business results are reported annually, and business people are used to thinking in annual terms. There may be debate about which of the various ‘profit’ numbers to use (for example, operating profit or profit after tax). Whichever is chosen, however, it is readily available in the income statement of the year under review. We may argue about whether, for ‘capital employed’, we should use the capital at the beginning of the year or at the end of the year, or the average capital during the year. However, whichever number is chosen can be easily found in the statement of financial position. But how many business investments run for exactly one year? The answer is few, if any. IT investments usually have a life of several years.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">How, then, can we adapt a method that originated as a means of measuring the annual profitability of a business, to the measurement of non-annual investments? Opinions vary, but the way most businesses do it is to express the average annual operating profit generated by the investment as a percentage of the average capital employed in it. An alternative approach is to compare the average annual profit not with the average but with the initial capital employed. There is one possible danger in this latter approach that will become apparent. That excepted, most of what is done with ROI is a matter of opinion and preference; it does not actually matter very much which approach is adopted. Consistency is the important thing.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">How to calculate average annual profit</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">We shall continue to use Example 4.1. Refer again to <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a> as necessary. The first stage is to work out the average profit to be generated by the investment. <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img96">Table 6.3</a> shows the method. Here, as in most real situations, there are two things to be done, and it will now be apparent why <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a> separated the cash flows into three different categories: fixed capital, working capital and operating cash flows. This separation was not necessary for using the cash flow-based methods so far considered, but it will be needed also for the next method to be discussed: shareholder value added (SVA).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Of the above-mentioned three categories of cash flow, only two affect operating profit: the fixed capital and the operating cash flows. Changes to working capital usually involve the conversion of one kind of asset to another. For example, the cash inflow arising when customers pay their bills more quickly is exactly that: the conversion of part of one asset called ‘receivables’ into another asset called ‘cash’. Such changes affect the statement of financial position but not the income statement, at least not directly.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">What incremental fixed capital cash flows will be generated by the acquisition and eventual disposal of the new systems? There are two: the initial cost of CU700k at the end of Year 0 and the eventual expected proceeds of sale of CU20k at the end of Year 4. However, now that we are dealing with profit and loss rather than cash flows the question is rather ‘how will these cash flows be represented in the income statements of Years 1 to 4?’ The answer is ‘through the mechanism of depreciation’. As already discussed, the ‘straight line’ method is often used in practice and we shall assume it here. What is it that should be depreciated? The answer is ‘the original cost less the eventual expected proceeds of sale’. So, in this case the total depreciation to be charged over the four-year period will be (700 − 20) = CU680k (or CU170k per annum).</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img96" src="images/img96.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1149"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">What incremental operating cash flows will be generated by the investment if it is undertaken? We know from <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a> that these come to a total of CU765k. How will these affect the income statements of Years 1 to 4? It has already been said that, in practice, timing differences between making sales and receiving payment, and between incurring costs and making payment, are usually ignored. The reason for this is that it makes at least one part of a quite complicated process much simpler for what is usually a relatively trivial sacrifice of accuracy. If the timing differences are ignored then ‘sales’ becomes the same as ‘cash received from sales’, and ‘costs’ becomes the same as ‘cash paid for costs’. This means that the numbers in the line in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a> called ‘incremental cash flows arising from changes to operating income and outgoings’ can be used to represent simply ‘incremental changes to operating revenues and costs’. This being so, the numbers can be used without change in the ROI calculation.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">We now have what are often the only two components necessary for the determination of ‘profit’ (usually operating profit) for ROI calculations. Still referring to <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img96">Table 6.3</a>, subtracting the total depreciation (CU680k) from the incremental net revenues (CU765k) gives the incremental profit (CU85k). Finally, dividing by the number of years gives us what we are looking for: the average annual incremental profit (CU21.25k). Notice that for the purpose of working out the ROI, it is only necessary to work with the total numbers. However, it is usually a simple matter to fill in the year-by-year details, which I have done in <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img96">Table 6.3</a>. It is often desirable to see the likely effect of the investment on profit year by year, not just in total, especially if operating profit is a basis for paying bonuses or measuring departmental performance.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">How to calculate average capital employed</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As already discussed, there are two kinds of asset: long-term (‘non-current’) assets and short-term (‘current’) assets. The financial resources used to acquire and replenish them are usually called respectively ‘fixed capital’ and ‘working capital’. Depreciation reflects the fact that non-current assets are usually used up over quite long periods, as is the capital invested in them. Current assets, on the other hand, are used up or ‘turned over’ quite quickly (in weeks or even days) but are constantly being replenished out of the cash generated by trading. The total of the incremental fixed capital invested and the incremental working capital required by, or liberated by, a project represents the total ‘capital employed’ in it.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">So, referring again to <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a>, we need to find out two things. First, how much incremental fixed capital is employed in the investment; second, how much incremental working capital is employed in it, or liberated by it? <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img98">Table 6.4</a> shows the answers to these questions.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Average fixed capital</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">What incremental fixed capital is employed in the investment? The answer (CU680k) is given by the first three lines of the table. The next stage is to work out the average fixed capital employed. Left to their own devices, most people do this by dividing the initial capital employed by the number of years (in this case, 700/4 = CU175k). Or, they might do it by dividing the net capital employed by the number of years (680/4 = CU170k). Wrong. Please think of the last time you had a bowl of soup. At the beginning of the meal the bowl was full. By the time you had finished the soup, however long you took to consume it, it was empty. What was the average contents of the bowl? The answer is one-half of the original contents.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">At the beginning of the project the fixed capital invested in it was CU700k. At the end, just before the equipment is sold, CU20k remains invested, the remainder of CU680k having been used up. However long the project (four years or four hundred years) the average capital employed is therefore one-half of the CU680k that has been used up, plus the CU20k that has been employed until the very last day. The calculation in this case is therefore [(680/2) + 20] = CU360k.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Average working capital</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">What incremental working capital is employed in the investment? In this case, one of the main purposes of the investment is to reduce the working capital employed on things like inventory and receivables. So, after taking into account the inventory of supplies and spares for the new systems, CU110k less of working capital will be invested throughout the period. Because it happens only right at the end of the project, the recovery of CU10k invested in the inventory of supplies has been ignored. Deducting from the average fixed capital invested (CU360k) the average working capital liberated (CU110k) gives the answer we are looking for: the average capital employed (CU250k).</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img98" src="images/img98.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1107"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">How is ROI used?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">There is now the quite trivial task of calculating the ROI from the two components just derived, by expressing the average operating profit generated by the investment as a percentage of the average capital employed in it. <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img99">Table 6.5</a> gives us the final answer. The ROI given in <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img99">Table 6.5</a> is 8.5 per cent. But so what? The answer to this is the same as the answer to the similar question asked earlier with respect to payback and to IRR. What is this company’s accumulated experience of the ROI, calculated in this particular way, of investments of similar type, size and risk? If the answer to that question is, say, 15 per cent, then our proposal does not appear in a very good light. If this company’s ROI ‘hurdle rate’ for investments of this kind were to be only eight per cent then we may just have scraped home. In fact, our proposal that originally looked quite promising is probably in pretty bad shape by this particular measure.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img99" src="images/img99.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="776"/></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch06-6">ROI AND RISK</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">If ROI is applied to numbers derived from cash flow estimates that have themselves been adjusted for project risk, then that risk has already been taken into account. If not, then a way of differentiating between investments with different perceived levels of project risk is to apply higher ROI hurdle rates to riskier investments.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">ROI as average profit over initial capital employed</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Remember that there are no ‘official’ rules for calculating ROI. Instead of average capital, some people use ‘initial capital employed’ in ROI calculations. <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img100">Table 6.6</a> shows the calculation. If you wondered why, in Example 4.1, we made the simplifying assumption that the reduction in working capital occurs instantaneously at the end of Year 0 rather than during Year 1, when it would actually occur, then a glance back at <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img98">Table 6.4</a> will provide one answer. It was so that all the attributable changes to capital employed, the effects of which would remain throughout the project, could be calculated easily.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">There is another reason, however, which applies both to the ‘initial capital’ approach to ROI and to the discussion of ‘shareholder value added’ (SVA) that follows. If this simplifying assumption is not made, then the (in this case substantial) benefits of reducing the working capital would be ignored in the calculations. This is not a danger with the approach based on ‘average capital employed’, because all changes to working capital throughout the evaluation can be taken into account through the averaging process. The small sacrifice of accuracy inflicted by putting changes to working capital into Year 0 is a reasonable price to pay for having a set of data that can be applied consistently to all the evaluation methods.</span></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img100" src="images/img100.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="749"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Some loose ends</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">In the example we have just worked through, what happened to the proceeds of sale of the old equipment and to the loss on sale that resulted? Why were these numbers not included in the ROI calculations? If it is indeed incremental capital employed that we are concerned with then it could certainly be argued that the net initial capital employed is the cost of the new systems (CU700k) less the sale proceeds of the old (CU30k). Some people might argue that it is this net number (CU670k) that should be used in the ‘average capital’ calculations. I have ignored the ‘old’ proceeds on the grounds that it is only the cost of the new systems that, via depreciation, will affect the profit during Years 1 to 4, the chosen evaluation period.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">I have ignored the loss on disposal for the same reason, but for another also. What is called loss on disposal is the difference between the book value and the market value of a disposed asset. It only arises because of inadequate depreciation in the past. Should a new investment be burdened with a ‘loss’ that arose out of what proved to be inaccurate accounting for its predecessor? I think not. However, because ROI has no firm ‘textbook’ rules, this aspect too can be regarded as a matter of personal preference.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">Finally, a criticism of the particular ROI method that I have illustrated might be that it does not take into account the cost of capital. Fortunately, help is at hand with the next evaluation method to be explained: shareholder value added (SVA). SVA, which does take into account the cost of capital, might be regarded by some as a substitute for ROI. Alternatively, if wished, the annual cost of capital, calculated by the method illustrated in <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img103">Table 6.8</a>, could simply be deducted from the annual operating profit numbers shown in <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img96">Table 6.3</a> before doing the ROI calculation.</span></p>
<div class="box">
<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText2">The purpose of ROI is to measure the return from an investment in terms of accounting profit (usually, but not necessarily, operating profit) as a percentage of capital employed (usually, but not necessarily, average capital employed). The main reasons why ROI is used are:</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Somewhere between NPV and ROI, but closer to the former, is the idea of shareholder value added (SVA). At the end of <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> the fundamental idea of SVA is introduced in the context of its original purpose. This was to determine whether, during an accounting year, a company has ‘added value’ to its shareholders by producing an after-tax profit that is greater than the return expected by them. That section includes an example of the SVA calculation, which, at its simplest and when applied to a company as a whole, is to deduct the return expected by the shareholders from the profit after tax. The example is shown in <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img224">Table 12.3</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Some companies have taken this essentially simple idea and adopted it as a way of managing the business. Thus used, it is sometimes applied as part of a ‘value-based management’ framework. The point is that if the purpose of a company as a whole is to ‘add value’ to its shareholders, then each part of the company’s business can and should be managed to contribute towards that end. That can mean setting SVA targets for divisions and departments, and motivating people to achieve them. It can also mean using SVA to evaluate investment opportunities, including proposed investments in IT.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Here we shall confine ourselves to the use of SVA in investment decision-making. But what is new? We have already considered and used the idea of evaluating an investment opportunity by reference to the return required by the company’s providers of money. The method is called net present value (NPV), and it consists of discounting the cash flows of the proposed investment at the company’s weighted average cost of capital or at a rate based on it. SVA is also based on cash flow and at its simplest can be used to obtain a result that is identical to NPV. We have also noted earlier that ‘cost of capital’ is an alternative and shorter way of saying ‘return required by the providers of capital’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Consider the following IT proposal.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch06-8">EXAMPLE 6.1: SVA</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent2">Assumptions</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li class="bullet-first bullet-first-override"><span class="no-style-override-7">The investment in assets is made on the last day of Year 0, will be depreciated straight line over Years 1 to 4 and will have no residual value.</span></li>
<li class="bullet-last">The company’s current weighted average cost of capital, used in NPV calculations, is 10 per cent.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img103">Table 6.8</a> shows both the NPV and the basic SVA calculations. The NPV of the amounts of ‘shareholder value added’ is the same as the NPV of the cash flows from which they were derived. In view of earlier advice against including depreciation of assets in cash flow estimates, it may seem odd that here we appear, in effect, to be doing just that. First, the word ‘depreciation’ in this context is used as a shorthand for the using up of the capital over the life of the investment. Second, the purpose of <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img103">Table 6.8</a> is to show that at its most fundamental, SVA is just another way of setting out present values. However, part of its usefulness is that it gives year-by-year results, whereas NPV only gives a single figure. It is useful to know when the value added by an investment occurs. A step-by-step explanation of what is happening in the SVA calculations in <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img103">Table 6.8</a> follows the table.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img103" src="images/img103.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1217" height="1400"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The first stage of the SVA calculations is to calculate the amount of capital (money) invested at the beginning of each year. If, as we are told, the assets acquired will be depreciated ‘straight line’ over four years, then it follows that the capital used to acquire them could also be said to be used up or ‘depreciated’ at the same rate. Remember, it was not just your old car that ended up worth nothing; so did the money with which you bought it.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The next stage is to show the operating cash flows and the cost of capital. What rate did we choose as the basis for discounting cash flows in NPV calculations? The answer is the rate representing the average return required by the providers of the capital, shortened to ‘cost of capital’, and in this case 10 per cent. The cost of capital each year is worked out by multiplying the capital at the beginning of the year by the percentage cost of capital.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The final stage is to show the quasi ‘cash flows’ represented by the ‘depreciation’ of the capital. The sum of these three elements is the ‘shareholder value added’ (SVA): the value that has been created for the shareholders each year by the investment after deducting the cost of capital, the return expected by the providers of the capital invested in it.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img104">Table 6.9</a> applies the same approach to Example 4.1.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img104" src="images/img104.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1281" height="1500"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">This is more complicated than Example 6.1 (<a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img103">Table 6.8</a>). However, the principles used are the same, and once again the NPV of the amounts of SVA is the same as the NPV of the cash flows from which they were derived. Notice that the effect of the permanent reduction in working capital is to reduce the total amount of capital invested, so there is less capital to be used up or ‘depreciated’. Excluding the proceeds of sale (CU20k) and the liberated working capital (CU10k) from the cost of capital calculation is necessary because these events would happen at the end of Year 4.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">I said above that SVA, like NPV, is based on cash flow. When applied to an individual investment opportunity, the cash flow numbers are readily available, as in the above examples. When applied to the performance of a company as a whole (see <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>), the relevant cash flow numbers can usually be found in the statement of cash flows. In the examples so far, for the sake of simplicity, tax has been ignored. Its effect on SVA and other evaluation methods will be considered in the next chapter.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch06-9"><span class="no-style-override">THE METHODS COMPARED</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">All the investment evaluation methods described in both this chapter and the preceding one provide different insights into the desirability of a proposed investment. As we have seen, their results can all be derived from the same base data. For convenience, <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img105">Table 6.10</a> summarises all the methods discussed and their main characteristics. <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img106">Table 6.11</a> summarises relevant totals and other extracts from the various tables of Example 4.1, while <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml#img107">Table 6.12</a> summarises all the evaluation results so far from Example 4.1. At the end of the next chapter, the results of all the evaluation methods that we have applied to Example 4.1 will be summarised, both before and after tax.</span></p>

<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="boxText2">The main points covered in this chapter, all linked to both its objectives, have been the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Payback or break-even is a method that seeks an answer to the question in respect of the cash flows of a proposed investment: ‘when do we get our money back?’</li>
<li>Discounted payback is the payback method applied to discounted cash flows.</li>
<li>Return on investment (ROI) uses accounting numbers to express the profit, usually operating profit, generated by an investment as a percentage of the capital, average or initial, employed in it. ROI is usually compared with a ‘hurdle rate’ that represents, based on experience, the required accounting rate of return from investments of this kind.</li>
<li>At its simplest and when applied to the evaluation of individual investment opportunities, shareholder value added (SVA) is another way of setting out present values. However, part of its usefulness is that it gives year-by-year results, whereas NPV only gives a single figure.</li>
