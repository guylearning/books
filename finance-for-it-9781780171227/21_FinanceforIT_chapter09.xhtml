<p class="paraNoIndent1">It is recognised that the methods of financing described in this chapter are not universally applicable. Where they are applicable there may be differences of detail between countries.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-2">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">‘Financing’ is the process of obtaining the money for something that it is wished to acquire or have the use of. ‘Leasing’ is a narrower term that means paying to use an asset that belongs to someone else. The term ‘leasing’ is usually associated with hardware but can also be applied to the financing of lump sum payments for licences to use software. You cannot lease a service, but you may be able to use financing, normally a loan, to rearrange the timing and amounts of payments due to the service provider, a matter also discussed in the context of outsourcing in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>. Leasing is governed by accounting standards. The current international standard is International Accounting Standard 17 (IAS 17) – Leases. The principles outlined in this chapter are based on that Standard and extracts from it are quoted, with permission, in the chapter.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-3">WHAT IS A LEASE?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee (the customer) in return for a payment or series of payments the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time. From now on in this chapter the word ‘customer’ will mostly be used instead of lessee. This is to avoid possible confusion between the two similar words ‘lessee’ and ‘lessor’. Depending on the kind of lease, the lessor assumes some or all of the following risks:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>the creditworthiness of the customer;</li>
<li>obsolescence and the decline in market value of the leased asset;</li>
<li>changes in interest rates, if the lease is at a fixed rate;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">changes in tax rates, although this risk is usually passed on to the customer by means of a ‘tax variation clause’.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">It follows that during the life of a leased asset the lessor must recover, from one or more customers:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>the cost of the asset;</li>
<li>interest paid or forgone on the money used to acquire it;</li>
<li>a proportion of the lessor’s overheads;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">a reasonable reward (profit) for services provided and risks assumed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Who offers IT leasing?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">There are three quite different kinds of organisation that offer IT leasing. They are:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>banks;</li>
<li>independent leasing companies;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">companies that provide IT hardware, software and services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Definitions and explanations of the different kinds of lease are given later in the chapter. They also appear in the Glossary. Meanwhile, suffice it to say that, in general, of the two main kinds of lease (‘finance’ and ‘operating’):</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>banks offer mainly finance leases, with or without a purchase option – banks do not generally deal in the equipment that they finance, although they may have subsidiaries that do;</li>
<li>independent leasing companies offer mainly operating leases or variations on the operating lease theme – they are usually dealers in equipment as well as being lessors;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">some IT companies offer leasing, as a sales aid, as a service to their customers and as a business in its own right – they may offer finance leases and operating leases.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Why lease IT?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Organisations lease IT for one or more of three main reasons:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>cash management;</li>
<li>asset management;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">financial management.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Cash management</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This may mean finding cash that is not otherwise available, conserving cash for more productive uses, or conserving existing lines of credit. It may also mean the attempt to match payments for an asset against the revenues and cash inflows that the asset will help to generate.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Asset management</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Even in some quite small organisations ‘IT’ often means a network of many individual machines, and the cabling, software and services that make them work and keep them working. For some organisations, help in acquiring, upgrading and eventually disposing of these assets is a major benefit of leasing. Furthermore, some leases – operating leases – provide protection against obsolescence of hardware by incorporating guaranteed ‘residual values’. (An explanation of residual value is given later in this chapter.) Furthermore, assets that are owned, and therefore ‘on the books’ of an organisation have to be accounted for, which means several things:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>maintaining an asset register containing the financial details of every asset, where it is located and who is responsible for it;</li>
<li>financial accounting;</li>
<li>tax accounting;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">management accounting, especially in an organisation that is divisionalised.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The greater the number of assets, the bigger the accounting task. Making one single quarterly or annual payment to a finance company rather than having to account for perhaps thousands of individual assets can be a major benefit for many organisations. As we shall see, however, only one kind of lease – the ‘operating lease’ – has the effect of taking the leased assets ‘off the books’ of the customer organisation.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Financial management</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Aspects of financial management for which leasing is used include the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>‘Off book’ financing and the optimisation of key financial ratios (explained later in this chapter).</li>
<li>International financing (also explained later).</li>
<li>Lower interest rates (leasing may sometimes be cheaper than ordinary borrowing).</li>
<li class="bullet-last">There may be possible tax advantages.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-4">LEASE DEFINITIONS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">We shall now define and consider the two main kinds of lease (‘finance’ and ‘operating’) and some of their variations, using the definitions and supplementary information in IAS 17 – Leases. While these are indeed two quite different kinds of lease it is nevertheless becoming less common for leases to be written in their simple generic forms. As organisations’ IT requirements are becoming more complex, and as services and software feature ever more prominently, so the boundaries between one kind of lease and another may become blurred. Increasingly, financing arrangements are being devised that contain elements of both kinds of lease. For financing things such as services and termination charges, that cannot be leased, then loan finance may be built into the overall financing arrangement as well.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The following extract is from IAS 17 – Leases:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="boxText">A <span class="italic">finance lease</span><span class="italic"> </span>is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset. Title may or may not eventually be transferred.</p>
<p class="boxText2">An <span class="italic">operating lease</span><span class="italic"> </span>is a lease other than a finance lease.</p>
<p class="boxRight"><span class="no-style-override-1">IAS 17 Paragraph 4*</span></p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="boxText">Whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease depends on the substance of the transaction rather than the form of the contract. Examples of situations that individually or in combination would normally lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease are:</p>
<p class="boxText2"><span class="no-style-override-27">(a) the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;</span></p>
<p class="boxText"><span class="no-style-override-27">(b) the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price that is expected to be sufficiently lower than the fair value at the date the option becomes exercisable for it to be reasonably certain, at the inception of the lease, that the option will be exercised;</span></p>
<p class="boxText"><span class="no-style-override-27">(c) the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset even if title is not transferred;</span></p>
<p class="boxText"><span class="no-style-override-27">(d) at the inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset; and</span></p>
<p class="boxText"><span class="no-style-override-27">(e) the leased assets are of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use them without major modifications.</span></p>
<p class="boxRight1"><span class="no-style-override-1">IAS 17 paragraph 10*</span></p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="boxText">Indicators of situations that individually or in combination could also lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease are:</p>
<p class="boxText2"><span class="no-style-override-27">(a) if the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessor’s losses associated with the cancellation are borne by the lessee;</span></p>
<p class="boxText"><span class="no-style-override-27">(b) gains or losses from the fluctuation in the fair value of the residual accrue to the lessee (for example, in the form a rent rebate equalling most of the sale proceeds at the end of the lease); and</span></p>
<p class="boxText"><span class="no-style-override-27">(c) the lessee has the ability to continue the lease for a secondary period at a rent that is substantially lower than the market rent.</span></p>

<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-5">FINANCE LEASES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A finance lease is initially written for a fixed ‘primary’ period. For most IT assets this is usually between two and five years. The supplier of the asset is paid by the lessor, who becomes the owner of it. During the primary period the customer (the lessee) usually pays by instalments the full purchase price of the asset plus interest on the money borrowed. Finance leases of which this is true may be called ‘full payout finance leases’. Although the asset is owned by the lessor, the customer may, rather confusingly, be described as having ‘full economic ownership’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Most IT leases of all kinds, including finance leases, are at fixed rates, although a variable rate option may be available. Most leases involve regular payments of equal amount. However, irregular payment streams can sometimes be arranged. These may include ‘holidays’ (install now, start paying later) or steps (smaller payments now, larger payments later). Payments may be quarterly, annually or at other intervals and may be either in advance or in arrears.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Options at the end of the primary period</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A finance-leased asset is usually not returnable to the lessor. Banks were the originators of finance leases and banks are not usually interested in handling the assets that they finance. At the end of the lease, when all payments have been made, if it does not include a purchase option, then the customer is usually responsible for disposal. If the finance-leased asset is sold, it is sold by the customer, acting as agent of the lessor (the legal owner), although the lessor may provide help for the customer in finding a buyer. The proceeds of sale usually belong to the customer (who has paid the full purchase price, remember), usually less a small percentage payable to the lessor. If the lease does have a purchase option, it is usually exercisable on payment by the customer of a small fee stated in the contract. A lease with a purchase option may be called ‘hire purchase’ or ‘lease purchase’. It is the type of finance sometimes used to finance domestic purchases.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">IT leases have to allow for the possibility that they will not run exactly for their full term. Customers may wish either to terminate a lease early or to extend it into a ‘secondary period’. On early termination of a finance lease, all outstanding amounts become payable, usually discounted to reflect the fact that the lessor is getting its money earlier. The customer then exercises its right of sale, retaining most of the proceeds of sale as described above. Because the customer has paid the full purchase price of the asset, extension of a finance lease, if required, is usually granted for what is sometimes called a ‘peppercorn rent’, a small per annum percentage of the original purchase price of the asset.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Upgrades</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">An upgrade may be the subject of a new lease, written at the time the upgrade is acquired and at the rate then on offer by the lessor. Alternatively, the original lease may be amended. In either case, the ‘new’ lease will reflect the fact that the effect of an upgrade will be to extend the life of the base asset. The practical effect will usually be for the lessor to charge for the cost of the upgrade by an extension of the primary period and a change (usually an increase) in the periodic payments. An alternative approach is to extend the lease by whatever period is necessary within reason to ensure no increase in periodic payments. This can be particularly attractive to customers with fixed budgets.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">It may be possible for an upgrade to a purchased asset to be leased and for an upgrade to a leased asset to be purchased. However, neither is done very often. If it is, then both parties have to agree on the respective shares of any eventual sale proceeds that will belong to them. Also, it may be possible for an upgrade to a leased asset to be leased with a different lessor, subject to the agreement of the first. In this case, all parties have to agree on their shares of any eventual proceeds. This, too, is not done very often.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-6">HOW ARE FINANCE LEASES ACCOUNTED FOR?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">If the customer had purchased the asset instead of finance-leasing it, whose books would it have appeared on? The customer’s, of course. The asset is being used exclusively in the customer’s business to earn revenue. Under a finance lease, there is certainly a difference in legal ownership; the lessor owns the asset. But is there any difference in who has exclusive use of it or in how it is used? No. Furthermore, the customer still pays usually 100 per cent of the asset’s cost (plus interest), albeit spread over time.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Whose books, therefore, should a finance-leased asset appear on: the customer’s or the lessor’s? The answer is that the economic substance of the lease takes precedence over its legal form and that finance-leased assets appear ‘on the books’ of the customer. If this seems to defy logic, then purists may perhaps take comfort by thinking of the customer’s asset in this case as being not a machine, for example, but as the right to use the machine.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The effect is the same. On Day 1 of the lease, the asset is recorded in the customer’s books at its purchase price. A corresponding liability represents the obligation of the customer to pay for it. Over time the asset is depreciated, just as it would have been if purchased. When payments are made, the liability is diminished by the capital element of the payments; the interest element is charged to the income statement as ‘finance costs’ in proportion to the size of the outstanding debt.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The books of the lessor show the reverse. The lessor’s asset is the right to receive the payments. As payments are received, the right is diminished by the capital element of the receipts; the interest element is shown in their income statement as ‘finance income’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Apportionment of interest</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A simple approximation sometimes used for the apportionment of interest over the years of a lease or loan is called, rather clumsily, ‘sum of the years’ digits’ (SOYD). For example, assume that the total interest payable under a three-year finance lease is CU6000. The SOYD (1 + 2 + 3) equals 6. The SOYD apportionment of interest would be as follows:</p>
<p class="leftImage"><img id="img133" src="images/img133.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="765" height="155"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For four- and five-year agreements the SOYD apportionment would be done respectively in tenths (1 + 2 + 3 + 4), fifteenths, and so on.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-7">SALE AND LEASE-BACK</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">It may be possible for an asset that an organisation has previously purchased to be sold to a bank or other lessor and then leased back. Such an arrangement is known, not surprisingly, as ‘sale and lease-back’. It involves the sale of the asset, for cash, to the lessor and the simultaneous writing of a lease, the asset itself remaining <span class="italic">in situ</span>. This is most often done when an upgrade is required, but money is not available to pay for it outright. The base asset is sold to a lessor and the (now upgraded) asset is leased back. By this means an organisation may obtain the use of a needed upgrade for little or no immediate cash outlay. It also avoids the awkward issue of joint ownership, discussed earlier. Lease-back under a finance lease is not a way of taking the asset off the customer’s books. It remains there, for the obvious reason that a finance-leased asset has, as just described, to be on the customer’s books.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Points to look out for in a finance lease</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">There are usually few unknowns in a finance lease. The lessor assumes the risks of customer creditworthiness and, if the lease is at a fixed rate, of changes in prevailing interest rates. However, its financial interest in the eventual market value, if any, of the leased asset is small, being limited to the small percentage of sale proceeds to which it is entitled. There are, nevertheless, differences between finance lessors’ contracts, apart from interest rates. For example, some lessors may be less willing than others to permit non-standard payment patterns such as holidays or steps.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">When is a finance lease appropriate?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A finance lease, with or without a purchase option, is a way of paying by instalments for the use of an asset. It is a particularly convenient way of financing assets, such as software licences, which have no residual value, and hardware assets that may have little or no residual value, perhaps because they are second-hand.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-8">LEASING AND FINANCIAL CASES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Whether to invest some of an organisation’s limited resources in new or replacement IT systems, and how to pay for the investment, are two quite different decisions. The first is usually called an ‘investment decision’, the second a ‘financing decision’. Purists would say that they should always be kept separate, and they often are, although sometimes they are merged, with lease cash flows being simply substituted for capital values in the financial case supporting the investment decision. However, there are some very practical reasons for keeping these two decisions separate, associated with the investment evaluation methods already discussed in <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml">6</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">For example, the net present value method certainly ‘works’ with leasing cash flows, simply because it ‘works’ with any cash flows. However, the mere names of some of the other investment evaluation methods, such as ‘internal rate of return’ (IRR) and ‘return on investment’ (ROI) imply, and indeed require, that there should be an ‘investment’ (an upfront commitment of money) upon which a ‘return’ is to be calculated. Taking an extreme case, if the upfront ‘investment’ is zero, because it has been replaced by a lease payment stream that includes an initial holiday, then the answer to the calculations – the ‘return’ – yielded by these two evaluation methods is infinitely great. However, those particular arithmetic results should not be taken as suggesting an infinitely desirable investment and would be best ignored.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The effect of leasing is usually to remove or greatly decrease that large initial investment by spreading the payments. However, leasing does not of itself convert what is in reality an investment decision to something else just because it has the effect of removing the large upfront payment. What it does is oblige the customer to make an additional and separate ‘financing decision’ to determine the real value of leasing compared with paying the lump sum upfront. The main aid to making this kind of decision is a present value (PV) calculation that compares the present value of a proposed lease payment stream with the present value of the alternative upfront payment.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">What discount rate do you think should be used in present value calculations of this particular kind? In the calculations that we have done so far, we have used the organisation’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as the discount rate. That was because the WACC was our point of reference: what we wanted to know was whether the return from the investment was greater than the weighted average cost of the capital (money) to be invested, and by how much. What is our point of reference in a ‘financing decision’ calculation? It is the current cost of borrowing from the organisation’s normal source, almost certainly its bank, and that is normally the discount rate chosen. <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml#img135">Table 9.1</a> illustrates this use of the ‘present value’ method. Assume the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>An organisation is planning to acquire IT assets costing CU100k on the last day of its financial year. At the end of four years it is estimated that the assets would be worthless and would be disposed of at nil cost.</li>
<li>The organisation has received a quotation for a full payout finance lease that would require four amounts of CU27.2k to be paid annually in advance.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">The organisation’s bank would currently charge eight per cent per annum on incremental borrowing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img135" src="images/img135.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="701"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The question is would the lease be cheaper in real terms than borrowing from the bank? The problem is solved by the now familiar process of discounting the lease cash flows, this time at eight per cent, then comparing the total of the present values so derived with the present value of the lump sum payment. The latter amount is of course undiscounted, because it would occur ‘today’ (Year 0). The same is true of the first lease payment. <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml#img135">Table 9.1</a> shows that the present value of the lease is CU97.3k, which, compared with the purchase price of CU100k, shows a margin in favour of the lease of CU2.7k.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">This result might suggest the finance lease to be the best option in this case. However, while it would certainly be one of the decision criteria, it would be unwise to enter into any lease solely on the basis of calculations such as this. The decision should only be made after detailed examination of the full contractual terms and conditions, especially those governing matters such as early termination and extension. Unsatisfactory terms relating to these matters could make the above apparent margin of 2.7 per cent in favour of the lease pale into insignificance. It is even more important to examine carefully the terms and conditions in an operating lease (our next topic).</span></p>
<div class="box">
<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText2"><span class="no-style-override-1">So far in this chapter we have covered the first four of its objectives. In particular we have:</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">discussed the different meanings of ‘financing’ and ‘leasing’;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">defined what a lease is and discussed what, in IT terms, can be leased;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">covered the main characteristics of finance leases;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">considered the effect of leasing on a financial case, distinguishing between the ‘investment decision’ and the ‘financing decision’.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">So far we have considered finance leases and noted that in practice they cause the customer to assume the product risk (of obsolescence and decline in market value). Can leasing do anything for customers who wish to some extent to shield themselves against this product risk by transferring it to a lessor? The answer is yes, and it is through the mechanism that is known as the operating lease.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-9">OPERATING LEASES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">If asked to describe a lease, most people, if able to at all, tend to describe what is actually an operating lease or something like it. Operating leases are very important ways of financing IT. One fundamental factor distinguishes an operating lease from a finance lease, and it is as follows:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">At the outset of an operating lease, the lessor deducts from the purchase price of the leased asset an amount, called the ‘residual value’ (RV), based on the asset’s expected resale value at the end of the lease. During the primary period, often no longer than about three years, the customer will only have to pay the balance, plus interest. At the end of the primary period, the customer can usually return the leased asset to the lessor, with no further obligation.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-10">RESIDUAL VALUE (RV)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Because the concept of residual value is fundamental to operating leases, it is worth spending time to become fully familiar with the idea. For example, assume that a machine costs CU1000 today. Suppose that a lessor, prepared to lease the asset under an operating lease, estimates that the value at which it could be sold three years from today, its market value, will be CU180. The first question is would the lessor be prepared to guarantee the full CU180 by including it as the residual value in the operating lease? No, because the CU180 can only be an estimate and the lessor will need a margin for error. The guaranteed residual value in the lease would be for a lesser amount, say CU160.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Suppose that the lessor, who will have to pay CU1000 for the asset, would indeed be prepared to guarantee a residual value of CU160 in the lease. If the interest rate that the lessor will charge is, say, seven per cent, how much will the customer have to pay for the lease over the three-year period? If you wish to think about it for yourself and you need a hint, then remember that CU160 receivable three years from today is not worth CU160. The answer is shown in <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml#img137">Table 9.2</a>.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img137" src="images/img137.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1456" height="1017"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml#img137">Table 9.2</a> shows that the present value of the RV, discounted at seven per cent, is in fact CU130.61. This amount, deducted from the purchase price (CU1000), leaves CU869.39, which is the present value of the amounts that must be recovered from the customer. Suppose that the lease is to be payable over three years, annually in arrears, which means that the first payment is due at the end of Year 1. We need a way of working out what the payments would have to be. <a href="26_FinanceforIT_appendix1.xhtml#img233">Table A1.3</a> in <a href="26_FinanceforIT_appendix1.xhtml">Appendix 1</a> allows us to do just that. It is called an ‘annual equivalent annuity’ table. ‘Annual equivalent annuity’ simply means the periodic payments that are equivalent in discounted terms, over a given number of periods, to a single amount today.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">What we want to know is the annual payment for three years in arrears if the discount rate is seven per cent. To use the table, start at the seven per cent row and move along until you come to the 3-year column. The factor that you find there is 0.3811. The payments for a three-year lease of CU869.39 would be found by the simple calculation CU869.39 × 0.3811, which comes to CU331.32. This means that the lease would require from the customer three payments annually in arrears of CU331.32. A proof of this calculation is shown in <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml#img138">Table 9.3</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Obviously, different annuity factors are required if the lease is payable in advance rather than in arrears or if the payments are due quarterly or monthly rather than annually. In practice, however, as with the other financial calculations in this book, people nowadays use the functions built into computer spreadsheets or financial calculators rather than tables. However, the tables remain a useful aid to understanding the principles.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent2">Options at the end of the primary period</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The customer’s options at the end of the primary period of an operating lease are dictated mainly by the need of the lessor to recover the residual value (the CU160 in the above example). The customer usually, therefore, has one or both of the following options:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Return the asset to the lessor, who will then either sell or re-lease it.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Extend, but for payment sufficient to recover the expected further decline in residual value during the extension period.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Some lessors also offer the option to convert the operating lease to a full payout finance lease. This involves a single payment, by which the customer effectively buys the lessor’s interest in the residual value and an extension, typically for one year, of the lease. Further extensions would then usually be at peppercorn rates. Extension or conversion rates may be stated in the original contract or they may be left to be negotiated at the time when the option is exercised.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Who offers operating leases?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A feature of an operating lease is usually the option eventually to return the leased equipment to the lessor. Therefore, any company offering IT operating leases is also going to be a trader in used equipment. We already know that banks have no interest in dealing in the assets that they finance, so banks themselves do not usually offer operating leases. The main providers of IT operating leases are:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>independent companies, some of which may be operationally independent subsidiaries of banks;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">the leasing subsidiaries of companies that provide IT hardware, software and services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Early termination of an operating lease</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">On early termination of an operating lease, as of any lease, all outstanding amounts become payable. The equipment is returnable to the lessor, who will need to recover the residual value by selling or re-leasing it. Note, however, that the market value on early termination may be higher than the residual value originally written into the lease, which was estimated as at a later date. Whether the customer gets any benefit from this possibly higher value will depend upon the terms of the contract. If the contract is not specific, then the matter will be left to be negotiated at the time of termination. The outcome may be influenced, to some extent, by the relationship between lessor and customer, and by whether the lease to be terminated will be followed by another.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In a continuing relationship between lessor and customer the termination of one operating lease is likely to be caused by the wish to replace old equipment with new. Such exchanges are a common occurrence and are sometimes known as ‘technology upgrades’. This is a confusing term because what is meant by it is replacement of old equipment with new, whereas ‘upgrade’ usually means new components replacing old within the same covers under the same serial number.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Rolled debt</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">When an operating lease is terminated and replaced by another, lessors do not necessarily require outstanding amounts to be paid in cash. They will sometimes ‘roll’ them into the next lease, simply quoting a rate that combines the new lease with debt from the old. This can be attractive, especially to customers with tightly controlled budgets. However, they should nevertheless understand that:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>unless the amount of the debt has been disclosed, rolling debt obscures both the costs of terminating the old lease and entering into the new;</li>
<li>after several ‘rolled’ terminations, quite large amounts of hidden debt may have built up without the lessee realising it;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">finance to pay off a debt is a loan. The accounting and tax treatment of loans is different from that of leases. To treat them as though they were the same is inaccurate, unless the amounts involved can reasonably be regarded as immaterial.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Operating lease upgrades</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Broadly similar considerations apply to upgrades under operating leases as under finance leases, but with some important differences. Under finance leases, you will recall, it is the customer that receives almost all of any eventual proceeds of sale. The higher the proceeds, the more the customer gets. The lessor’s interest in the proceeds is small, usually limited to a small percentage of the original capital cost. With operating leases, however, eventual return of equipment to the lessor is a requirement. This, you will recall, is because the lessor will need to recoup its investment in the residual value.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Therefore, operating lessors will try to ensure maximum market value for the equipment that they own. They will also seek to ensure the simplest state of affairs when the return takes place. This will normally be achieved if the leased asset is wholly owned by a single lessor. Operating lessors are therefore usually reluctant to allow upgrades to be financed other than with themselves, although it is sometimes done.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">One of the things that can significantly affect the market value of IT equipment when it is returned is whether or not it consists wholly of manufacturers’ standard components. Some lessors require manufacturers’ standard parts, if removed, to be refitted before a machine is returned.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">As is the case with finance leases, an upgrade may be the subject of a new lease, or the original lease may be amended. In either case, the ‘new’ lease will usually reflect the fact that the effect of an upgrade is to extend the life of the base asset. If an upgraded asset is the subject of more than one lease, lessors will usually require all of them to expire at the same time. This is because of the obvious necessity of ensuring that the equipment is returned as a whole, complete with all its upgrades.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-11">HOW ARE OPERATING LEASES ACCOUNTED FOR?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">You may recall from the definitions earlier in the chapter, that where a lease transfers ‘substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset’ to the customer, then the lease is called a <span class="italic">finance lease</span>, and the leased asset must appear on the customer’s books, together with the debt owed to the lessor. You may also recall that accounting standard IAS 17 gives several examples of situations that individually or in combination would normally lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease. An <span class="italic">operating lease</span> is a lease other than a finance lease. Determining which category any particular lease belongs to is often a matter on which it is wise to seek professional advice.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">How should customers (lessees) account for operating leases? The answer is delightfully simple and is an important reason for the popularity of operating leases. The leased asset does not appear as an asset in the customer’s books; neither do the outstanding amounts appear as a liability. Payments under operating leases are charged straight to the customer’s income statement as expenses and, like other expenses, they should normally be charged on a straight-line basis even if the payments are irregular. For example, suppose that on the first day of its accounting year, a company writes a three-year operating lease with an initial one-year holiday, and payments during Years 2 and 3 of CU30k, as in <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml#img140-1">Table 9.4</a>. The lease would be charged to the income statements of Years 1 to 3 as in <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml#img140-2">Table 9.5</a>.</span></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img140-1" src="images/img140-1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="378"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img140-2" src="images/img140-2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="380"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Not only is this kind of accounting obviously much simpler than that for finance leases; if the numbers are significant, then it also ensures the least impact on some of the key financial ratios. In particular, with a finance lease, as with bank borrowing for outright purchase, both the asset and the debt are shown on the customer’s books. This results in higher totals of both assets and debt. Because of this, both the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the debt/equity ratio are adversely affected. See <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> for an explanation of these and other financial ratios. In the case of ROCE, this is because for much the same amount of profit there is a greater quantity of ‘capital employed’ (usually meaning, in this context, equity plus long-term debt). In the case of the debt/equity ratio it is because, for the same amount of equity, a greater quantity of debt is shown. So, on whose books does an operating-leased item appear as an asset? The answer is: the lessor’s, and the lessor depreciates the asset in the usual way over its expected useful life.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Sale and lease-back</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The principle of sale and lease-back is the same, whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. If it is judged to be an operating lease, then the sale and lease-back may remove the asset from the customer’s books, any ‘loss on disposal’ being taken to the income statement as an expense. However, the older an IT asset is when the sale and lease-back occurs, the more likely it is that the lease would be judged to be a finance lease, in which case the asset would remain on the customer’s books. This is because the residual value that a lessor would be willing to guarantee on a (now) second-hand asset would usually be nil or very small, so ‘substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership’ would be judged to be transferred to (or, in this case, to remain with) the customer.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-12">RISK AND REWARD</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">By comparison with a finance lease, what advantages would customers expect to gain by (where possible) writing an operating lease for IT equipment? They are as follows:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>lower lease payments during the primary period;</li>
<li>the guaranteed residual value written into the lease;</li>
<li>‘off book’ finance, with consequent enhanced financial ratios if the amounts involved are significant;</li>
<li>simpler accounting;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">avoiding the chore of disposal, by being able to return the equipment to the lessor at the end of the lease.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">What the operating lessee reaching the end of the primary period usually forgoes, by comparison with a finance lessee, are the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>The certainty (usually) of nominal (peppercorn) payments for continued use in a secondary period.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Any ‘profit’ should the eventual market value of the leased asset exceed the residual value written into the lease, although this would usually not be a problem in respect of those operating leases that include an option to convert the lease to a finance lease. Meanwhile, however, the lessee will have been protected from any ‘loss’ should the converse be the case.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For operating lessors, the risks and rewards associated with an operating lease are the converse of all the above. The major risk taken by an operating lessor is product risk: the risk of obsolescence and decline in market value. However, remember that operating lessors are dealers as well: they buy and sell equipment. They may also offer services of various kinds to their customers. An example is the provision of asset management services, described in the next paragraph.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Lessors have to keep accurate records of all their leased assets, from both an accounting and a tax viewpoint. Accounting for large numbers of assets can be a challenging task for many organisations. The fact that the lessor, rather than the customer, has the task of maintaining these records is itself a major benefit of leasing for many companies. For a charge, some lessors may make their own asset management facilities available online to their customers. Customers can enquire into the status of their leased assets and may also use the facilities to record details of their own (non-leased) assets.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Points to look out for in an operating lease</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The following is a summary of key points to consider:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>To what extent are the options available to the customer stated and priced in the contract?</li>
<li>What does the contract say about upgrades? Could they be financed other than with the same lessor?</li>
<li>What is the position regarding non-standard or second-hand parts?</li>
<li>What does the contract say about extension? Would extension be at a fixed rate or at fair market value? If the latter, how is fair market value determined? What period of notice to extend is required? Does the primary rate automatically continue if the required notice is not given?</li>
<li>Under what terms can the lease be terminated early?</li>
<li>Does the contract provide a conversion to full payout finance lease? What rights, if any, does the customer have to participate in any excess of market value over residual value and through what mechanism?</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Assuming follow-on business, will any termination debt be stated separately? What facilities does the lessor provide for financing termination debt?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">When is an operating lease appropriate?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">An operating lease would usually be appropriate for an organisation that does not necessarily require to take ownership of the leased asset and that:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>wants the lessor to assume the product risk;</li>
<li>wants lower (than full payout finance lease) primary period payments;</li>
<li>wants the option of returning equipment to the lessor;</li>
<li>is willing to accept usually higher (than full payout finance lease) secondary period payments;</li>
<li>is willing to accept a nil or lower (than full payout finance lease) proportion of eventual sale proceeds;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">wants simpler accounting.</li>

</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-13"><span class="no-style-override">VARIATIONS ON THE LEASING THEME</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In order to understand the principles of IT leasing it made sense to look at the two main kinds of lease (finance leases and operating leases) separately and in their ‘pure’ forms. This we have done, and the distinction between the two kinds of lease is important. However, many IT investments today are complex, and some financing arrangements tend to be correspondingly so. As a result, the boundaries between particular kinds of lease are now sometimes less clear than they used to be. To close this chapter we shall consider briefly some variations on the leasing theme.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Composite leases</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Composite leases (not an ‘official’ term) are arrangements that, in a single contract, provide finance for the possibly many different elements in an IT development. These may include:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>IT and communications equipment from various manufacturers;</li>
<li>software from various providers;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">services, which may be anything from project management, training and maintenance, through installation services to managed operations or full outsourcing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In constructing such arrangements, the lessor must consider and price each element separately. Some items of hardware may qualify for operating lease rates, some only for finance leases. One-time charges for software licences may be leasable on finance lease terms. The financing of services depends on the nature of the service. Services generally cannot be leased, although financing can be used to reschedule the timing and amounts of payments due to service providers by means of loans.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">From a cash flow point of view, all this may be a matter of indifference to the customer, who simply wants a ‘bottom line price’ in the form of a series of payments. However, what customers cannot be indifferent about is how such leases are accounted for. The accounting rules do not give specific guidance on this question and, like much of lease accounting, it is an area where it would be wise to seek professional advice on particular situations.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-14">EXCHANGE LEASES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This term is sometimes used to describe financial arrangements that have been packaged specifically around the idea of what were earlier described as ‘technology upgrades’, more accurately perhaps called asset replacements. They can be especially attractive to organisations that are constrained by rigid adherence to budgets. Under arrangements of this kind, a customer may install a tranche of various items of equipment for a specified period in return for agreed payments. At or after stated times, up to a given proportion of the assets, in terms of value, can be exchanged for new ones at no increase in periodic payments. To compensate the lessor for unpaid amounts on the replaced assets, the term of the lease is extended. Replacements above the stated proportions may be made, but if so then the periodic payments are increased.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Arrangements of this kind are based on operating lease principles. They consist of a series of leases, some of which are terminated early and replaced by others that have a later end date. The new leases will typically include termination charges from the leases terminated. Such arrangements may sometimes make an IT solution easier to sell and easier to buy. This is because both buyer and seller know that some items in a proposed solution are more advanced in their product life cycle than others and may soon be superseded by new technology. To the customer, here is a financial package that recognises that fact and allows them to do something about it by exchanging old technology for new at the appropriate time. Furthermore, the initial term of the contract can be determined according to what the customer can afford, whether in cash or budget terms. The higher the periodic payments, the shorter the term; the lower the payments, the longer the term has to be. However, it is also the case that the longer the term, the less likely it is that the underlying leases would qualify as operating leases. As for the accounting treatment, here too it would usually be wise to seek professional advice on particular situations.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-15">RENTAL</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">What is the difference, if any, between leasing and rental? There is no ‘official’ answer to this question. Both confer rights to use equipment or software in return for periodic payments. Both may confer rights to purchase. A description that appears to fit the facts, at least so far as equipment is concerned, is that under a lease there is usually, discernible by the customer, a direct connection between the purchase price of the equipment and the total of the periodic payments required. With rental there is often no such discernible connection.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For example, a person who chooses to rent a TV set may never know the purchase price and will probably not be interested. Over the period of the agreement they may actually be paying for the TV several times over. They do not mind, because they are not paying for a TV. What they are paying for is the right to use a TV, and what they want is a payment stream that matches their budget and their expected availability of cash. Repair and replacement services are often included and they can if they wish cancel the agreement at short notice, and return the goods. It is this aspect that tends typically to make rental of IT equipment, where it is offered at all, quite risky for the supplier, and therefore expensive for the customer. Although once very common for IT, rental is now usually used only to cover short-term requirements. These might include, for example, an organisation moving its offices from one location to another, or when equipment might be requirement short-term for use at a trade exhibition.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Pay-for-use arrangements</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Financing arrangements are sometimes written under which a customer organisation pays an IT supplier not for machines delivered but for processing power actually used. Using IT terminology, the customer is paying for ‘mips’ (millions of instructions per second) or gigabytes rather than for machines. Typically, the customer will contract and pay for a minimum number of units to be provided by the supplier over a defined period. If the customer requires more than the contracted number, then they pay at an agreed rate for the extra. How such arrangements are accounted for would, yet again, usually be a matter for professional advice. However, depending upon the particular circumstances, these arrangements may appear to be almost indistinguishable from rental.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-16">INTERNATIONAL FINANCING</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">With the development by many organisations of international networks comes the need to finance them. This can be a complex process, especially if done piecemeal, using different financing organisations in different countries. Some lessors, themselves usually international companies with knowledge of the differing accounting and tax rules in various countries, offer international financing services to their customers. Typical features of such services are:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>a single set of contract terms and conditions, applicable in all the countries covered by the agreement, for supplying hardware, software and services from various suppliers;</li>
<li>the option to add country-specific terms and conditions, where necessary to satisfy local regulations;</li>
<li>invoicing to a single location;</li>
<li>payment in the currency of choice;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">the ability to move equipment freely between countries, although doing so will usually have tax implications.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-17">‘SMALL TICKET’ LEASING</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This piece of leasing jargon refers to the leasing of small items of equipment such as personal computers (PCs). The principles of leasing are the same, whether for small items or large. However, there are some particular aspects of small ticket leasing that are worthy of note.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">First, the costs of administering a lease are much the same whether the leased asset costs CU1000 or CU1 million. Therefore, while lessors may be reluctant to lease a single PC, they would be willing to lease large numbers of them under a single agreement. Second, small items such as PCs are typically delivered piecemeal over a period. Some lessors are sometimes willing to write a single lease on all the small items to be acquired by the customer at any time during a particular period, typically one quarter. This saves administration costs for lessor and customer alike.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-18">THE LEASING CONTRACT</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Different lessors offer different terms and conditions. Perhaps the main difference between leasing contracts is the extent to which the customer’s options are set out in the contract. At one end of the spectrum are contracts in which every option for the customer throughout the lease is stated and priced. These priced options may include:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>the primary period lease rate;</li>
<li>secondary period rates for various renewal periods;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">conversion rates to full payout finance lease, if offered.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The mechanism for determining the extent to which the customer may, on early termination, participate in proceeds of sale may also be described in the contract. At the other end of the spectrum are contracts in which none of the above is specified except the primary period rate.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Swings and roundabouts</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The more specific the contract, the more certainty does the customer have. However, such a contract leaves little scope for the lessor to ‘make up on the swings what it may lose on the roundabouts’ if, for example, it starts to look as though it may have overestimated the residual value in an operating lease. The pricing of the primary period rate and of the options will take this additional risk into account. On the other hand, the less specific the contract, the less risky it will usually be for the lessor. The lessor may, therefore, be able to build in a higher residual value, in the knowledge that it has some room for manoeuvre when the customer comes to upgrade, terminate early or extend.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Neither kind of contract is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. The important thing is to consider the deal on offer as a whole. The customer that opts for certainty should not necessarily expect to get it for nothing. The customer attracted by cheaper primary period payments should not expect to find its subsequent options so cheap when it comes to exercise them. In IT leasing, as in most aspects of life, there is no such thing as a free lunch.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch09-19">THE FUTURE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Financing and especially leasing are continually evolving subjects, as are the rules and accounting standards under which they operate. They are matters of continual debate in the IT and accounting professions worldwide. Hitherto they have played a significant role in helping IT users to afford what might otherwise have been unaffordable, and will no doubt continue to do so into the future.</p>
<div class="box" id="ch09-20">
<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="boxText2">The main points covered in this chapter, linked to its objectives, have been the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee (the customer) in return for a payment or series of payments the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time. All components of an IT acquisition can be financed; hardware and lump-sum charges for software licences by means of leases, payments due for services by means of a loan.</li>
<li>The main sources of IT leasing are banks, independent leasing companies and some providers of IT hardware, software and services.</li>
<li>A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee. It may include a purchase option. An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. </li>
<li>In leasing terms, ‘residual value’ is an amount, based on an asset’s expected value at the end of a lease, deducted by the lessor from the asset’s cost in determining the payments due under the lease.</li>
<li>During the currency of a lease the lessor owns the leased asset. Under an operating lease the leased asset is on the books of the lessor. Under a finance lease the leased asset is on the books of the customer (the lessee).</li>
