<div class="ul">

</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The achievement of these objectives is a necessary prerequisite for understanding how to build a financial case to justify a proposed IT investment.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch03-2">COST CASES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The financial case that we considered in the previous chapter is what would usually be called a ‘cost case’, because with the exception of amounts receivable for selling the respective cars we have only considered expenditures. We have made no attempt to quantify the benefits of owning cars in general or those cars in particular. This is because we as individuals have generally come to regard a car as either a necessity or at least as highly desirable.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Many people no longer bother to work out how much the alternatives – public transport, taxis or occasional hiring – would cost, and consequently whether owning a car is the most cost-effective option. Neither do we generally even try to quantify the ‘intangible’ benefits of what we might perceive as our better image or enhanced status from having a superior car rather than an inferior one.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">It is true that not every business decision is an ‘investment decision’. For example, we shall see in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> that a decision whether or not to outsource IT (or any other function) is essentially a ‘cost reduction decision’. However, in this and the next three chapters we shall be considering aspects of financial cases in the context of ‘investment decisions’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Whose money is it anyway?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The reason why we can afford the luxury of not quantifying the benefits of (for example) car ownership is that we are spending our own money. The reason why a business cannot afford the same luxury was introduced in the previous chapter. It is that a business is always spending someone else’s money: the money invested by the proprietor(s) and lenders. This is most obviously true in the case of limited companies, whose proprietors are the shareholders. However, it is also helpful to think of it as being true of any other business, including a one-person business, and indeed of other kinds of organisation, such as charities, the public sector and other non-profit-making bodies.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The more such organisations adopt good business practices, the more sound financially are they likely to be. Governments recognise this truth. For example, in some countries both national and local government now use what are known as ‘generally accepted accounting principles’, particularly in their accounting for assets. In what follows in this book, I shall mostly refer to companies, by which I mean limited companies. However, the principles and practices described can be applied in any kind of organisation, including the public sector.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In the case of a limited company the shareholders – the investors – appoint directors to act as custodians of their money and to run the business on their behalf. The directors in turn delegate some of this authority to managers. Investors have a free choice in deciding where to invest their money. Rational investors invest it where they believe they will obtain the highest ‘return’ commensurate with an acceptable level of risk. If the company in which they have, for the time being, invested ceases to produce what they regard as the highest return available, then they will take out their money and put it elsewhere.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch03-3">FINANCIAL CASES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">The ‘return’ on the shareholders’ money will be the total of the returns on all the individual investments that the company makes. Examples of investments made by companies might be any of the following: building a new manufacturing plant, developing a new product, entering a new market, taking over a competitor, buying shares in a supplier, or undertaking an IT investment. Each discretionary investment by a company, in IT systems for example, should only be made if it can reasonably be shown that, of all the possible uses of the limited funds available, it is likely to produce the highest return. The investment may deliver a return directly, or as an enabling project, not itself profitable but facilitating other investments that will be.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In business therefore, no longer should the question be ‘which course of action costs least?’ but ‘which course of action returns the most?’ To answer that question it is necessary to compare the costs associated with an investment with the benefits that will be generated. So, in business we are usually concerned with building, not just a cost case, but a cost–benefit case, and it is this that is usually being referred to when business people talk of a ‘financial case’. However, a financial case is an aid to decision-making, it is not a decision maker. While most businesses produce a financial case for any significant investment, there are wide variations in the extent to which it is actually relied upon in making the decision whether to proceed or not. A financial case is usually part of something bigger, called a business case.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch03-4">BUSINESS CASES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A business case sets out all the arguments for and against a proposed course of action, including the financial arguments. Whereas the financial case only includes those matters that it has been possible to express in numeric terms of benefit and cost, the business case, on the other hand, includes such matters as:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Do we have to do this for legal or regulatory reasons?</li>
<li>Is this proposal in accordance with the business strategy? This will itself have been formulated with a view to maximising the long-term return on shareholders’ money.</li>
<li>Is this an enabling project, not profitable in itself, but an essential foundation for others that will be?</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Can we afford not to do this? Can we afford not to enter a new market that a competitor has entered (for example, a supermarket going into financial services), or not to adopt a new technology that a competitor has adopted (for example, a retailer installing electronic point of sale systems)?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Intangible or soft benefits</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A business case will also usually include what are called intangible or soft benefits. Examples of words often used to describe these are:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>improved company image;</li>
<li>increased brand awareness;</li>
<li>improved employee morale or loyalty;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">better service to customers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Note that it is benefits that are usually soft; costs have a habit of being depressingly hard, and to get bigger as the full implications of the investment become apparent.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Some investment decisions may be taken wholly on consideration of the financial case. Others may be taken with little or no consideration of it. Which approach is favoured will depend partly on a particular company’s way of doing things. Some companies are heavily driven by numbers, others are not. Within a particular company, the approach taken will depend partly on the nature of the proposed investment or project and partly on the personalities of the decision makers. For example, a decision whether to replace old IT technology with new, with no strategic overtones, will often be heavily influenced by numbers. By contrast, a decision whether to develop a new product or enter a new market is more likely to be driven by gut-feel and entrepreneurial flair.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Hardening soft benefits</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Since many investment decisions are in fact influenced, at least to some extent, by the numbers, it makes sense to ensure that whatever benefits can be quantified are quantified by the proposer of the idea. Two particular and related techniques are useful here. The first is the repeated use of those two most useful words – ‘So what?’ The second is to get the potential ‘buyer’ of the idea (internal or external) to do your selling for you. Smart sellers know that their objective should be the same as the buyer’s – and the business buyer’s objective should be to maximise the return on shareholders’ money. Taking as an example the soft benefit ‘better service to customers’, a useful conversation to have, with yourself if nobody else wants to play, might go as follows:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">‘A benefit of this system will be better service to customers.’</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">‘So what?’</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">‘Customers will be happier with us as a supplier.’</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">‘So what?’</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">‘Where they have a choice, customers will be more inclined to buy from us than from our competitors.’</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">‘So what?’</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">‘So our sales will increase.’</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Having established that if the cited benefit means anything it means that sales will increase, the question then becomes ‘by how much?’ This is where you get the ‘buyer’ to do your selling for you by pleading from ignorance – an idea described as ‘the power of one’ by Mack Hanan (2011). Choose the sort of percentage increase in sales that you believe the other person thinks is achievable, and then suggest a much smaller number. Suppose you believe that your ‘buyer’ actually anticipates a sales increase of five per cent as a result of your proposal, then suggest one per cent. If this smaller number will itself make your case, so much the better. In any event, if your original estimate of what is in the other person’s mind was about right, then they may start to talk you up. Continuing with the above example, the conversation might proceed as follows:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">‘Suppose as a result of the proposed investment we can increase sales by one per cent?’</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">‘Oh, I’m sure the increase would be more than that.’</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">To this the reply is, of course:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">‘Really, how much more?’</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">– and you are well on the way to having quantified the previously unquantifiable.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch03-5">WHAT IS A BENEFIT?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">From a financial point of view, a benefit is not a benefit unless it has a positive number attached to it, and it is financial matters with which we are concerned in this book. There are only four ways in which a financial benefit can arise in the case of a typical business investment, such as IT. These are:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>an increase in income;</li>
<li>a decrease in, or avoidance of, outgoings;</li>
<li>bringing forward income;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">postponing outgoings.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For the sake of completeness it should be added that another kind of financial benefit is represented by the appreciation in value that may occur with some kinds of asset. Land, buildings and shares are examples. Land and buildings may feature in IT investments but since the likelihood of their appreciation is unpredictable it would be unwise to count on it in the process of trying to justify an investment.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For the time being we shall concentrate on the first two items in the above list: increasing income and reducing or avoiding outgoings. The last two items in the list represent one reason why discounted cash flow is such an important factor in investment justification, and why it was one of the first principles that we covered in this book. The last of the four, postponing outgoings, is one reason, but often not the most important reason, why leasing can be such a useful way of financing IT. See <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>: IT financing and leasing.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText2">So far in this chapter, we have covered the first four of its objectives. In particular:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have discussed why businesses have to be more rigorous in justifying investments than do we as individuals;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have considered financial cases in the context of business cases;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have looked at ways that may help to put a financial value on so-called intangible benefits;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have listed the four kinds of financial benefit likely to be relevant to an IT investment.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch03-6"><span class="no-style-override">CASH FLOW AND PROFIT</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In the above, I have mentioned ‘income’ and ‘outgoings’. What, in business terms, do these words mean? In business, there are two ways of looking at income and outgoings. They are:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>cash flow, which means receipts and payments of cash;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">profit, which means revenues earned less expenses incurred, whether they have been received or paid for in cash or not.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">Ultimately, the most important of these two meanings in business is the same one that is important to us as individuals, namely cash flow. We have already established that the primary purpose of business is to increase the wealth of its proprietors. That, ultimately, means cash wealth, and if it means cash wealth for the proprietors it had better mean cash wealth for the business too. That is the main reason why investment opportunities are usually evaluated primarily in terms of their effect on the cash flow of a business, even if other methods are used as well.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">If cash flow is so important, what then of profit? Are business results not reported primarily in terms of profit and loss? Indeed they are, although companies now have to produce a statement of cash flows as well as an income statement as part of their annual accounts. However, the key word above is ‘reported’. Profit is a reporting device, necessary partly because of the convention, now long enshrined in law, that companies have to report their results to their shareholders at least once a year. However, it is also the best way yet devised of measuring the increase in wealth, or ‘net worth’, of a business during a period.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The market trader</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Ultimately, profit and cash flow are the same thing. It is their timing that differs. The simpler the business, the easier is this idea to understand. Imagine Fred, a market stallholder who buys (for cash) and sells (for cash) tins of beans. Suppose that Fred buys a new supply of beans every day, and that everything he buys is sold the same day, so that there is no unsold inventory; also that there are no other expenses. Suppose that in a year Fred’s purchases amount to CU80,000 and his sales to CU100,000. <a href="15_FinanceforIT_chapter03.xhtml#img47">Table 3.1</a> shows Fred’s statement of cash flows and income statement for his first year. From these you will see what common sense tells us to be true – that for Fred, net cash flow and profit are indeed the same thing.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img47" src="images/img47.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="870"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Now imagine Newsoft Limited, a small software house that has just started business in rented premises. They have bought (for cash) IT systems for CU60,000, which are estimated to have a useful life of four years and no residual value. They will write off the systems, on a ‘straight line’ basis, over the four years, so that depreciation charged as an expense will be CU15,000 per year. Depreciation is covered in some detail in <a href="20_FinanceforIT_chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>. Suffice it to say here that it is a way of charging the cost of a long-term or ‘non-current’ asset as an expense over its expected life. Also assume the following facts concerning the first year of business:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Sales (all received in cash) are CU200,000.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Expenses (all paid in cash) other than depreciation are CU160,000.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Please now look at <a href="15_FinanceforIT_chapter03.xhtml#img48">Table 3.2</a>. It shows Newsoft’s statement of cash flows and income statement for its first year.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img48" src="images/img48.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1000"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Profit positive, cash flow negative</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Newsoft is showing a profit for the year of CU25,000, but a negative cash flow of CU20,000. The difference of CU45,000 is that part of the cash expenditure on the IT systems that has not yet been charged to the income statement as depreciation, as it represents an expense attributable to subsequent years.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">At the end of the fourth year, if all other expenses continue to be paid in cash, and all revenues are received in cash, then taking the four-year period as a whole, Newsoft’s profit, like Fred’s, would be equal to its net cash flow.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In the above example of Newsoft (<a href="15_FinanceforIT_chapter03.xhtml#img48">Table 3.2</a>), depreciation was the only reason for the difference between net cash flow and profit. In reality, however, there are many reasons why Newsoft’s, or any other company’s, net cash flow in any year would rarely if ever equal its profit. They include the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Sales made but not yet paid for in cash by the customer (called trade receivables).</li>
<li>Cash expenditure incurred on work not yet completed (work in progress) or sold (finished goods).</li>
<li>Goods and services received from suppliers not yet paid for (trade payables).</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Tax due but not yet paid (non-trade or ‘other’ payables).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Depreciation</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Over how long a period should assets, IT assets for example, be depreciated? Generally, assets should be depreciated over their expected useful lives. However, what is the expected useful life of a particular kind of IT asset? For one business it might be two years; for another it might with equal legitimacy be five years. The same kinds of asset might have different expected useful lives at different stages of a business, depending on the speed of its growth. The main thing that the rules require is consistency, within and between accounting periods.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The longer the write-off period, the lower the depreciation per year. Profit is revenue less expenses. Depreciation is an expense, so the lower the depreciation the higher the profit, and vice versa. It is easy, is it not, to understand the temptation to write off assets over a longer period rather than a shorter period, despite the problems, described in <a href="20_FinanceforIT_chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, that this can cause.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Furthermore, there is nothing to say that the ‘straight line’ method is the only way of calculating depreciation. A method that more closely reflects the decline in market value of an asset would be to write off a percentage of the cost, say 50 per cent, in the first year, then 50 per cent of the remaining cost the following year, and so on until the asset is sold or scrapped. <a href="15_FinanceforIT_chapter03.xhtml#img50">Table 3.3</a> shows what adopting this approach would do to Newsoft’s profit in its first year. Instead of the CU25,000 shown in <a href="15_FinanceforIT_chapter03.xhtml#img48">Table 3.2</a>, with the now greater amount of depreciation charged as an expense, the profit has gone down to CU10,000. Choose the depreciation period and method for significant assets, and to some extent you have chosen your profit. Accounting is an art and not a science.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Inventory valuation</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">If you need more convincing of this, then think of your local corner shop. The ‘cost of sales’ of the corner shop in its first year of business is its purchases less the value of its unsold inventory at the end of the year. But what is the value of the unsold inventory of a shop? Cost price? Perhaps, but the cost of the latest purchases of each line or of the earliest purchases, or the average cost? And what about allowances that should be made for deterioration? And how accurate was the inventory count? The valuation of inventory has a direct effect on profit. The higher the inventory value the lower the cost of sales, and therefore the higher the profit; the lower the inventory value the higher the cost of sales, and therefore the lower the profit.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Profit is to some extent a matter of opinion. That is not to deny its importance, or the need to try to calculate it as accurately as possible. If it is important artificially to chop up the continuous process of business into chunks of one year’s duration – and it is, for several reasons – then the concept of profit is now universally accepted as the best way of doing so. The reasons why we have to chop business results into one-year chunks include the following:</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img50" src="images/img50.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="614"/></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Reporting results to the proprietors.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Having a basis for assessing tax.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The profit concept is also useful for measuring the performance of divisions or departments within a business, and as a basis for motivating and rewarding employees – with profit-related bonuses, for example.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch03-7">A BASIS FOR INVESTMENT DECISION-MAKING</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The point of all this is to try to determine which of those two most important measures of business activity, cash flow and profit, provides the soundest basis for investment decision-making. Look again at <a href="15_FinanceforIT_chapter03.xhtml#img48">Tables 3.2</a> and <a href="15_FinanceforIT_chapter03.xhtml#img50">3.3</a>. By changing the method (and, had we wished, the period) of depreciation, we changed the profit. Did we also change the cash flow? No, we did not. Short of deliberate misrepresentation is there anything that we could do to change the statement of cash flows? No, there is not. Our personal bank statement at the end of each month shows our cash position as it is. We may not like it and, in particular, we may not like the colour of the ink in which the final balance is printed, but we are stuck with it. Cash flow is a matter of fact.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Any investment by a company, in IT systems for example, will have an effect on both the company’s cash flow and its profit over the following few years. It is of course important to work out the likely effects of an investment on both cash flow and profit, and most businesses do so, as we shall see. But which of the two provides the sounder basis for deciding whether to make the investment or not? For most organisations, cash flow is the main basis of financial cases to be used as aids to investment decision-making.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">As it happens, the numbers representing the cash flows provide the basis for all the main investment appraisal methods that are commonly used. We have already looked at one of these – net present value. In <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml">6</a> we shall look at them all in some detail. Before doing so, however, we need to look at what it is that we should be evaluating.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">When is a benefit not a benefit, and a cost not a cost?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">It is often quite difficult to decide what should go into a financial case, and what should be left out. What should go into it is, surely, the benefits and costs attributable to that course of action, were it to be undertaken. In the example of the car project we made a start with trying to establish which costs and benefits are ‘attributable’ to a proposed investment and which are not. We covered the most fundamental of the principles, but we have to do more in order to complete the picture and to make it relevant in the context of IT decision-making.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">We must come up with as complete an answer as possible to the questions ‘when is a benefit not a benefit, and a cost not a cost?’ This we shall do in the next chapter, using, as the means to achieve understanding, an IT-specific example.</p>
<div class="box" id="ch03-8">
<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="boxText2">The main points covered in this chapter, linked to its objectives, have been the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">Companies always have to consider the benefits of a proposed investment as well as the costs. Companies are the custodians of money invested by shareholders, who seek to maximise the return on their investment.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">A financial or ‘cost–benefit’ case in business is a statement of the estimated financial benefits and costs, over a chosen period, of a business opportunity. It is usually part of a business case, in which both financial and non-financial implications of the investment are set out.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">In financial cases for discretionary investments, only quantified benefits count. ‘So what?’ questions, and deliberate understatement, can sometimes help to quantify intangibles.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">In business, except for the possible appreciation in value of assets such as land, there are four ways of deriving a financial benefit: increase income, reduce or avoid outgoings, bring income forward, or postpone outgoings.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">Cash flow is a matter of fact; profit is a reporting device and, to some extent, a matter of opinion. Cash flow is usually the main basis of financial cases to be used as aids to investment decision-making.</span></li>
