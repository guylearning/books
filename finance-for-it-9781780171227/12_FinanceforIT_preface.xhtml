<p class="chapterTitle">PREFACE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">This is a practical book to help readers understand and use the methods available for financially justifying IT, or similar, projects. It makes clear both the power and the limitations of those methods. It includes many examples, all with detailed workings, many of them linked to form comprehensive illustrations of the principles described. All the examples are based on the authors’ many years of practical experience of cost-justifying and financing IT projects from the very large to the quite small, in both business and non-business organisations, and of teaching the same to those who make or influence decisions about IT.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">The book is a sandwich, with <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml">Chapters 2</a> to <a href="23_FinanceforIT_chapter11.xhtml">11</a> as the filling. Everything in those chapters has relevance, direct or indirect, to making decisions about IT, or indeed any similar kind of ‘project’. The content should be understandable to readers with little prior knowledge of finance or accounting. It may also be useful to non-specialist financial people for whom decisions about IT are not an everyday occurrence. </span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml">Chapters 1</a> and <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml">12</a> are for readers with no prior knowledge. <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> is called ‘Finance and accounting: the basics’. Its purpose is to provide sufficient information on the fundamentals to make the rest of the book intelligible. <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> is called ‘Financial analysis: the basics’. It is for readers who want to know something of how financial ratios can reveal the dynamics of a business or other organisation, and how some of those ratios may be affected by significant IT or similar projects and the ways in which they are financed. For these two chapters only, a ‘minimalist’ approach in note form has been adopted in order to focus on the essentials in the minimum of space.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The numbers, interest rates and discount rates used in the examples have been chosen for simplicity, not to reflect the particular economic conditions of the second decade of the 21st century. If you can’t stand numbers anyway, then ignore them and just follow the logic in the narrative. It has been deliberately designed to allow you to do so.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Terminology and accounting standards</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">When the first edition of <span class="italic">Finance for IT Decision Makers</span> appeared in 1998 the idea of international accounting standards was quite new. Each country had, over a long period, developed accounting standards of its own, which made it very difficult to compare the published accounts of companies in different countries. In the 14 years since then moves towards ‘globalisation’ have been quite rapid in many fields. This has been especially so in the world of finance and accounting.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In particular, many countries have already adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as mandatory for the published ‘group accounts’ of publicly traded companies, that is companies whose shares are traded on stock exchanges. Other countries are in the process of doing so. For accounts other than group accounts, companies are often permitted to use IFRS or to continue using their particular country’s own national accounting standards. Eventually the adoption of IFRS by ‘non-public’ companies, that is the majority of companies, may also become mandatory in many countries.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In recognition of this situation, this third edition of <span class="italic">Finance for IT Decision Makers</span> is deliberately international in its scope, and uses the terminology of IFRS. Previous editions of the book, written primarily for a UK readership, used the terminology of the then applicable UK standards. Periods of transition are seldom comfortable times to live through, so to help the reader <a href="12_FinanceforIT_preface.xhtml#imgxix">Table P.1</a> is a ‘translation table’ of all the IFRS terms used in this edition and their equivalents in the previous editions. I have also indicated those equivalents in the much longer list of definitions in the Glossary. Finally, the first time each ‘new’ term appears in the main text I have appended the ‘old’ term in brackets. However, this information can obviously only be a snapshot at the time of writing (July 2012). The international standards themselves, and to some extent their terminology, will continue to evolve.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="28_FinanceforIT_appendix3.xhtml">Appendix 3</a> contains, with permission, an example of recently published group accounts that were prepared to IFRS principles.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The website of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (<a href="http://www.ifrs.org">www.ifrs.org</a>) is a principal reference point for anyone seeking access to IFRSs. The IFRS Foundation offers free access to the current year’s consolidated unaccompanied English language IFRSs and official interpretations thereof. ‘Unaccompanied’ means without the implementation guidance and the ‘basis for conclusions’. It also provides free access to the technical summaries of the standards in a number of languages. Also included is a country-by-country list showing the current extent of adoption of IFRS for listed companies in the ‘G20’ group of countries.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">To the extent that IFRS may not yet have been adopted by a particular country, check with the accounting standards authority of that country for the current version of its own national accounting standards. Another website that I have found useful is <a href="http://www.iasplus.com">www.iasplus.com</a> provided by the international accounting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (<a href="http://www.deloitte.com">www.deloitte.com</a>).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">A further consequence of making this third edition ‘international’ is that the use of any particular national currency in examples would be inappropriate. I have therefore adopted the convention of using the term ‘currency unit’ or ‘CU’ in the text and CU’000 or CU’m (for million) in table and figure headings. Finally, in the text I use the convenient approximation ‘k’ for ‘one thousand’.</p>
