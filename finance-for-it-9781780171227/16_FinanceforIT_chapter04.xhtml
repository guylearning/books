<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="italic">The purposes of this chapter are:</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="italic">to allow you to experience, step by step, building an IT financial case in incremental cash flow form;</span></li>
<li><span class="italic">to show you that it can sometimes be quite difficult to decide whether a particular benefit or cost is really attributable to a proposed IT investment or project;</span></li>

</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">When is a benefit not a benefit; when is a cost not a cost, especially in evaluating IT investment? We are now in a position to apply the principles of cash flow-based financial cases to the kind of situation typical in IT decision-making. To do so we shall use an example (Example 4.1). In working through it we shall discover that in practice it is not always easy to answer the above questions.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch04-2"><span class="no-style-override">HOW TO BUILD AN IT FINANCIAL CASE</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This is one of the examples in the book from which you might gain by attempting to work through it yourself, before you look at the solution and before you read the explanations that follow it. I shall, quite deliberately, not give you any guidelines in advance, beyond the principles already discussed in earlier chapters. The reason is this. Many people experience difficulty with the task of building IT financial cases. The solution and explanations will have more relevance to you if you have already experienced that difficulty.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">You may, of course, not wish to tackle the problem yourself. As I said in the Preface, if you can’t stand numbers, then ignore them and just follow the logic in the narrative. Just continue reading, treating the example, its solution and the detailed explanations as a continuous part of the text. For some of the items in the example, alternative answers may be valid, depending on what assumptions you choose to make about the points in question.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The point of the example is to encourage you to think about each item described, and to decide whether or not you think it should be included as a relevant cash flow in the financial case. To some extent, neither the numbers nor the situation as a whole are realistic. For example, with today’s technology, whether or not to install a new inventory control application would usually be regarded as a separate decision from whether or not to install new equipment on which to run it. I have combined them, and several other things besides, into a single assumed ‘project’, requiring a single decision. The reason is simply to provide one vehicle for illustrating as many of the problems typically presented by IT financial cases as possible. The next few pages describe the situation.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch04-3"><span class="no-style-override">EXAMPLE 4.1: DESCRIPTION</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">Assume that a company has some problems in need of solution. Among them are that:</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>its expenses are too high;</li>
<li>it holds too much inventory, and knows that it could operate with at least 10 per cent less if only it could be more efficiently organised;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">its customers are taking too long to pay their bills.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">All these things are putting an unacceptable strain on the company’s cash resources. Parts of the company’s existing IT systems need replacing anyway, and the company believes that the benefits from increased efficiency brought about by new systems and new applications would more than justify the costs.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The input data</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A short time ago the chief executive officer (CEO) appointed a team led by a senior, non-financial, manager to collect data on the likely benefits and costs of this project over a four-year period. The team was not due to report yet, but assume that this morning the CEO will summon the team leader and ask for a brief statement of what the costs and benefits were looking like in case the matter were to come up at this afternoon’s board meeting. (‘Nothing elaborate – back-of-envelope stuff will do.’) The team leader sat down with the file and wrote down the notes that you will find in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img54">Table 4.1</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">How to approach the task</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The team leader now has the task of putting the data into a suitable form for the board meeting. The question is ‘if you had been given the job, what would the financial case look like?’ If you have chosen to try this for yourself as an exercise, or if you have to do something like it in real life, then I suggest that you adopt the following approach:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(1) Go step by step through the input data (in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img54">Table 4.1</a> for this example). Do not be alarmed by its apparent complexity. In the narrative that follows you will be taken step by step through every line.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(2) <span class="no-style-override-7"> Regarding each item, decide whether it represents a cash flow that is attributable to the proposed investment.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(3) <span class="no-style-override-7"> Write the numbers representing the cash flows, with plus or minus signs, under the years in which they will occur.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(4) <span class="no-style-override-7"> Total across and down so that in the bottom right-hand corner you end up with a number representing the total net incremental cash flows attributable to the investment.</span></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img54" src="images/img54.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1046" height="1500"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img55" src="images/img55.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1128" height="1500"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img56" src="images/img56.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1449" height="1017"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Most people who are not financially trained (and some who are, but for whom this kind of thing is not an everyday occurrence) find some difficulty in such tasks. Remember that what we are trying to do is to determine what cash flows representing benefits and costs can properly be attributed to a proposed investment. The purpose, eventually, is to decide whether or not to undertake the investment or, if it were already in progress, to continue with it. Remember also the following points, discussed earlier:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>What we are producing is a cash flow estimate, so it follows that anything that is not a cash flow should be excluded. Later in the book we shall be producing a profit and loss estimate from the same data.</li>
<li>The cash flow estimate will be used for decision-making. We cannot make decisions that will change the past. Therefore, anything that represents a past cash flow that cannot be reversed (a sunk cost) should be excluded. A past cash inflow that cannot be reversed could, I suppose, be called a ‘sunk benefit’. This term is not in common use, but exactly the same principle applies to both costs and benefits.</li>
<li class="bullet-last"><span class="no-style-override-7">Do not confuse decision-making with other business activities. Documents quite similar in some ways to the one we are building here will be produced and maintained for such purposes as pricing (of external contracts) and management accounting. These, however, will include all the costs incurred and revenues earned since the project was first thought of. Such documents are record-keeping documents; ours is intended as an aid to decision-making.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">If in doubt, then, about whether a particular item should be included, you should ask the following question: if a decision were to be made to go ahead (or to continue) with the proposed project, would this particular item represent a future cash inflow or outflow that would not have occurred otherwise? If yes, then include the item; if no, then exclude it. By ‘the project’ I mean, in this case, the proposal to stop doing what we are currently doing and to adopt the alternative that is being proposed.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch04-4"><span class="no-style-override">EXAMPLE 4.1: SOLUTION</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">With these guidelines in mind, I suggest that you now look at the solution (see <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img58">Table 4.2</a>). If you attempted the exercise yourself, then compare your answer with mine. With some of the items, the answer depends on what assumptions were made, so my solution may differ from yours. Provided my result follows logically from my assumptions, and yours from your assumptions then there is no problem. If you did not attempt the exercise, then simply read through <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img58">Table 4.2</a> point by point and see whether you think that it makes sense.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In either case, you should then read through the following paragraphs that explain why I have done what I have done. The only other guidance I would offer is to repeat that while academics, and many practitioners, agree broadly on the principles illustrated by this exercise, individual organisations would differ on points of detail, of format or even on points of principle. They simply do things differently. The best I can hope to do is to offer explanations for the approach I am illustrating that are logical and convincing, to provide a basis for understanding better how your particular organisation does things and why.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch04-5"><span class="no-style-override">EXAMPLE 4.1: EXPLANATIONS</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The following are explanations for the solution in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img58">Table 4.2</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Existing IT equipment</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">For the purpose of decision-making, the original cost of the existing equipment is irrelevant. It is a past cash outflow that cannot be reversed (a sunk cost), so it is ignored.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The depreciation of the current (and of the proposed new) equipment is undoubtedly important for accounting purposes. However, depreciation is simply an entry in the account books and does not represent a cash flow. Therefore it is excluded from financial cases based on cash flow. Later, it will be taken into account when we come to look at the effect of the proposed investment on profit.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">We were told that the book value of the old equipment at the end of the current year will be CU190k. The difference between this and the expected proceeds of sale of CU30k represents a ‘loss on sale’ of CU160k. This too is important for accounting purposes, and represents inadequate depreciation charged as an expense in the past. However, it does not represent a cash flow, so it is excluded from the cash flow financial case.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img58" src="images/img58.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1038" height="1500"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">One piece of information about the old equipment that is relevant to our cash flow estimate is the expected proceeds of sale of CU30k. It is shown as a cash inflow in Year 0.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The only other relevant information about the old equipment is its running costs, which we shall no longer incur if it is sold. Avoiding a cash outflow that would otherwise be incurred is a benefit attributable to the investment, so the relevant amounts are included as positive numbers in the appropriate years. Even though this is an incremental financial case, I have chosen to show the old running costs and the new as separate items, simply to illustrate that point. Showing them separately is also a way of highlighting the difference between the ‘old’ and ‘new’ numbers, if to do so is an important argument in selling the case, internally or externally. Instead, I could of course have shown a single incremental line entitled ‘system running costs’. I adopt this approach later in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">New systems</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The purchase cost (CU700k) of the new systems is clearly a cash outflow that will occur if the proposed project is undertaken but would not occur if it is not. Therefore it is included.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Depreciation does not represent a cash flow, so it is excluded. Once again, however, if we wished to consider the effect of the proposed investment on profit, as distinct from cash flow, as we shall do later, then of course depreciation would be taken into account.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The eventual proceeds of sale represent a cash inflow that will only occur if the new systems are acquired, so the amount is included. In the case of equipment that is subject to regular replacement, we might produce several versions of the financial case. Each would assume different replacement times, at which the equipment would have different estimated market values. In this way it is possible to work out the optimum replacement cycle for such equipment.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Is it right to include in our financial case the sale proceeds of both the old equipment and the new? The answer is yes, because whichever course of action is decided upon, stay as we are or make the change, we shall end up in four years’ time in the same situation (with no equipment, just as in our earlier example of the two cars).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The running costs and maintenance of the new systems are cash outflows obviously attributable to them, so they are included.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Supplies and spares for new systems</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The inclusion of this item, although the amount is quite trivial, was to illustrate the fact that with many investments in major assets there are two quite separate and different kinds of ‘capital’ expenditures. There is the cost of the asset itself. In addition, there usually has to be an initial investment in inventory of supplies and spares. For this also, a cash outflow will be incurred. At this point, it is appropriate to digress in order to compare and contrast the terms ‘fixed capital’ and ‘working capital’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Characteristics of ‘fixed capital’ items</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Major assets, such as significant items of IT hardware, are relatively long-term investments, by which I mean that they have expected useful lives of more than one year. They are usually called ‘non-current assets’ or sometimes ‘fixed assets’, and the money used to acquire them is therefore sometimes called ‘fixed capital’. Significant one-time charges for software, whether for ownership or for rights of use of more than one year, are also regarded as non-current assets.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The main characteristic of most non-current assets is that during their useful lives their value is used up and not replenished. This is what ‘depreciation’ means. Therefore the value of the capital invested in them is also used up.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">When the old car finally goes to the breakers, it is not just the car that has been used up but the money that you spent on it. Both these things are represented in accounting terms by charging depreciation as an expense. Doing so reduces the ‘book value’ of the asset; it also reduces the profit, because the higher the expenses the lower the profit. Profit is simply the amount by which the equity of a business is increased by trading, so reducing the profit also reduces the equity.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Characteristics of ‘working capital’ items</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">By contrast, things like inventory, whether of supplies and spares, raw materials, work in progress or finished goods, are short-term assets. By this I mean that they are typically used up in less than a year. Such assets are called ‘current assets’ or (sometimes) ‘circulating assets’, and the money used to acquire them is called ‘working capital’ or ‘circulating capital’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The main characteristic of inventory of things like supplies and spares is that as they are used up they are replenished, so the level of the inventory tends to remain the same. Therefore the amount of money (working capital) invested in them tends to remain much the same throughout the life of the asset that they exist to support. In preparing a financial case, the assumption is often made that shortly before the end of that asset’s life, the inventory of its associated supplies and spares will be run down to zero. At this point, what would have been a cash outflow to replenish the inventory does not occur. The avoidance of a cash outflow is just as much a benefit as is an increase in cash inflow.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Suppose, however, the probability that the system now being proposed will eventually be replaced by a similar one for which it is believed that the supplies and spares will be equally suitable. In that case, the assumption would probably be that the inventory of supplies and spares would not be run down. If that were so, then there would not be a corresponding avoidance of the final cash outflow for replenishment. Here is one example of the evaluation of a project being influenced by what may be known, or reasonably assumed, about its eventual successor. We shall meet others.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Raw materials and other inventory</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">That was rather a long explanation, but this particular topic is one that many people have difficulty with. Also, what is true of movements in one kind of inventory (supplies and spares) is also true of other kinds. The argument is therefore equally valid for the general inventory of the business (raw materials, work in progress and finished goods).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Inventory reduction is an important purpose of many IT applications. Inventory on a shelf waiting to be processed or sold has had to be paid for – with cash. So have the materials and labour expended on partially finished products or services, usually known as work in progress. The greater the quantity of inventory, the more cash has had to be paid. We have either had to borrow this money and are paying interest on it, or we are losing interest on money that could otherwise have been invested.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2"><span class="din-bold-10pt">How to handle a decrease in inventory levels</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">If inventory has to be increased, for seasonal reasons or because of an expansion of business, that inventory will have to be paid for. That will represent a cash outflow to bring it up to its new higher level. On the other hand, if, as a result of new systems, inventory is reduced in any year (usage remaining constant), it must mean that cash that would have been paid out for replenishment has not had to be paid. There will thus have been a decrease in cash outflow that year equal to the decrease in inventory. Since we are assuming that this decrease in cash outflow would not have occurred but for the new system, it is therefore a benefit attributable to the investment, and should be included in our cash flow financial case.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img62">Table 4.3</a> shows in detail how the numbers are arrived at. Notice that it is the amount by which inventory has decreased between the end of one year and the end of the next that represents the decrease in cash outflow during the year. Once inventory has stabilised at a new level there is no further change to the annual cash outflow until the inventory level changes again. The numbers in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img62">Table 4.3</a> are trivial, but you may find it a useful template for more complex situations.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Now we revert to the point alluded to earlier. At the beginning of the project we had to spend cash on an initial inventory. Therefore, an equivalent amount of cash will be ‘liberated’ when that inventory is run down to zero at the project’s end. The initial cash outflow is balanced by a corresponding cash inflow at the end. Unless, that is, we believe that the inventory can and will continue to be useful to the successor project.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The influence of a successor project</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Where, as in this example and in many IT applications, an expected benefit of a project is a reduction in inventory, then the reverse process must be considered. As inventory is reduced, cash that would otherwise have to be spent replenishing it no longer has to be spent (the avoidance of a cash outflow). However, to evaluate a project at all it has to be assigned, however artificially, an ‘end’. If the benefit of the project were indeed to end, then in theory there would be an increase back to the earlier level of inventory, and a consequent cash outflow corresponding to the earlier inflow represented by the reduction. Unless, that is, we believe that the effects of this project (lower inventory levels) will continue under its successors. In this case, we would be justified in not burdening the presently proposed project with such a cash outflow.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img62" src="images/img62.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="1159"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For example, imagine a project to install a computer-integrated manufacturing system. Once installed and working, it would be most artificial to imagine that the whole system would be dismantled in a few years just because the technology on which it was first installed needed replacing. At that time, the proposal to replace the technology should be evaluated for what it would then be: a technology replacement proposal, not a ‘new application’ proposal. In practice, therefore, it is unlikely that an increase in inventory at the end of a project would need to be considered.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Trade receivables</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Trade receivables are customers who have not yet paid for goods or services that they have bought from us. Money that belongs to us is in their bank accounts rather than in ours. That means that, as with money tied up in inventory, we are either having to borrow money and are paying interest on it, or we are losing interest on money that could otherwise be invested. If, as a result of the new system, receivables are reduced in any year (sales remaining constant) it must mean that there has been a cash inflow that year equal to the decrease in receivables. Since we are assuming that this cash inflow would not have occurred but for the new system, it is attributable to the project. It should therefore be included in our cash flow financial case.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img63">Table 4.4</a> shows in detail how the numbers are arrived at. As with the reduction in inventory, it is the amount by which receivables have decreased between the end of one year and the end of the next that represents the increase in cash inflow during that year. Once receivables have stabilised at a new level there is no further change to the annual cash inflow.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">As with inventory, if it is believed that the effects of a credit control application will continue after its initial evaluation period, then the benefit represented by the initial reduction in receivables need not be reversed in the financial case.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img63" src="images/img63.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1454" height="1084"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Financing</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As discussed in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, there is certainly a sense in which receipt of a bank loan is a cash inflow. Its eventual repayment is a cash outflow, as are the periodic payments of interest. However, as also demonstrated (see <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img39">Table 2.13</a>), the discounting process has the effect of cancelling out these ‘financial’ cash flows, so to include them would be a waste of time and space. Also, it starts to get a bit silly if a financial case were to include ‘financial cash flows’ if the project happened to need borrowed money, but did not include them if the company happened to have sufficient cash of its own. For both these reasons, ‘financial cash flows’ are ignored.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Inventory holding costs</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The assumption made in this case is that inventory holding costs (for example warehousing, insurance, deterioration, theft and obsolescence) vary with the average levels of inventory. So the benefit each year attributable to the new system is an avoidance of cash outflow equal to 10 per cent of the difference between the average inventory level under the old system and the average inventory level under the new. As you may imagine, we shall eventually be discounting the cash flow estimates that we have compiled. The discounting process will take care of the cost of the money ‘tied up’ in the inventory, so only the ‘non-financial’ costs of holding inventory should be taken into account.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img64">Table 4.5</a> shows in detail how the numbers are arrived at. It was only in recording the reduction of inventory itself that we made the simplifying assumption of an instantaneous occurrence at the end of Year 0. For the purpose of calculating inventory holding costs, I have assumed that the reduction in inventory occurs gradually and evenly throughout Year 1.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img64" src="images/img64.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="1304"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Consultants’ fee</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">‘Dear Bloggs and Co, as we have decided not to go ahead with the project, we request the return of your consultancy fee.’ Unless they are an unusually generous firm of consultants, their fee is unlikely to be returnable, whatever decision is made about the project. The fee is a sunk cost and should therefore be excluded from the financial case.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Contract staff</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This is another example of costs avoided: an avoidance of cash outflows that, but for the proposed investment, would occur. Therefore the amounts are included as attributable benefits.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Storekeepers</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">Here, some thought is needed to ascertain what cash flows are actually attributable. If the new project does not happen, the older storekeeper will continue to be paid wages until the end of Year 2. If it does, then, as a direct result, his Year 2 wages will not be payable: the avoidance of a cash outflow and therefore a benefit attributable to the project. However, also as a direct result of the project, the lump sum of CU15k will be payable, in addition to his Year 1 wages. This is an attributable cash outflow.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">With regard to the second storekeeper, since she is staying with the firm, at the same wages, her wages are an equal expense under either option and should therefore be ignored. However, but for the proposed investment, the firm clearly intends to employ an additional person and it is the expense of that additional person that will be avoided if the investment is undertaken. Therefore, it is the wages for the job externally advertised that represent the avoidance of a cash outflow attributable to the project. The fact that the new job arises in a part of the firm remote from the project is not relevant. It is the company as a whole that will avoid the cash outflow.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Rent of IT department space</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Cross-charges, sometimes called allocations, are ‘book’ transfers from one departmental budget to another. They represent the value of goods or services provided by one department to another within an organisation. The rent of IT department space is an example.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">An analogy with depreciation may be helpful. Depreciation can be thought of as a way of allocating amounts of money spent at a particular time to the future periods that benefit from the expenditure. Cross-charges can be thought of as a way of allocating amounts of money, spent by one part of a business, to other parts of it that benefit from the expenditure. Both are consequences, precise or approximate, of money having been spent, but both are simply entries in account books. They are not themselves cash flows.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The question remains ‘if a decision were to be made to go ahead with the proposed project would this particular cross-charge represent a cash flow that would not have occurred otherwise?’ In this case the answer is no. There would be no change to the amount paid externally for the space occupied by the IT department.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">Suppose, however, that things were really bad in accounts payable, so bad that a decision to rent additional external space had already been taken. Then suppose that the opportunity to move into the IT department’s space would allow that decision to be rescinded. Then, the (real) money that would no longer have to be spent on external space becomes a benefit (the avoidance of a cash outflow) attributable to the project. It would therefore be included in the financial case.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Can ‘funny’ money be treated as if it were real money?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Are there then any circumstances in which it might be possible to regard a cross-charge as a ‘cash flow’ in investment evaluation? The answer has to be that so long as we choose to use cash flow analysis as a basis for the evaluation, then we should stick to its rules. The most obvious of these is that only changes to cash flows should be included.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In practice, a ‘receiving’ manager will know where a past cross-charge has come from. It may therefore be possible, by enquiry, to determine the amount of any real cash flows that gave rise to it. Similarly, it may be possible, by enquiry, to determine the estimated amount of future changes to a cross-charge if an investment being evaluated goes ahead. If so, it may be possible to discover the amount of the estimated real cash flows, if any, that lie behind it. If truly ‘attributable’ according to the rules, then those cash flows should be included in the evaluation. However, what would be included would indeed be the attributable cash flows, not the cross-charges that provided the clue to their existence.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Estimating the effects of a decision on budgets</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Budget-holding managers will of course be interested in the effects that investments, if undertaken, will have on their budgets, and on how their department’s performance will be measured. For that reason, and because cross-charges are usually a fact of life for budget-holders, documents that look very like cash flow estimates will often be produced that include cross-charges. Such documents may indeed show the effects of proposed projects on budgets.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Analyses that contain both cash and non-cash items are not ‘cash flow financial cases’ as we have come to understand them. It follows that it would be invalid to apply to them evaluation techniques, such as discounted cash flow, designed to evaluate only cash flows. However, as already acknowledged, organisations have their particular ways of doing things. Nevertheless, if variations on the standard theme are used, it is important to try to work out exactly what ‘advice’, if any, is being offered by the results.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Specialist programmers</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The attributable cost in Year 1 is the opportunity cost represented by the revenue forgone. Thereafter, the attributable cost is that of hiring an additional specialist specifically for the project.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Other cash outflows avoided</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As stated in the problem, all significant cash flows would usually be itemised. In this example, these are just balancing numbers, designed to ensure that the totals are numbers that it will be easy for us to work with later.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch04-6">WHAT CASH FLOWS ARE RELEVANT?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">That concludes the explanations of the solution to Example 4.1. The bottom line of <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img58">Table 4.2</a> shows the total net incremental cash flows attributable to the proposed investment and the years in which they would occur. <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img67">Figure 4.1</a> shows these cash flows diagrammatically, while <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img68">Figure 4.2</a> is a similar diagram, but of the cumulative cash flows. The example should have reinforced the rules that we formulated in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> about which items should, and which should not, be included in cash flow financial cases. It has also suggested a few additional rules. The following, for convenience, is a now slightly enlarged summary of the rules.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The following should be included in cash flow financial cases:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Cash flows that will occur if the proposed investment goes ahead, but will not occur if it does not.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In consequence, the following should be excluded from cash flow financial cases:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Past cash flows that cannot be reversed (sunk costs, and indeed ‘sunk benefits’).</li>
<li>Cash flows that do not differ between the alternatives.</li>
<li>Depreciation and losses (or profits) on the sale of assets.</li>
<li>Cross-charges or allocations from one departmental budget to another. However, cross-charges may provide clues to real cash flows that will occur elsewhere in the business that may themselves be attributable to the investment.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Anything else that is not a cash flow.</li>
</ul>

<p class="centerImage"><img id="img68" src="images/img68.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="935"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In addition, we have already discussed the fact that financial cash flows, including receipt and repayment of loans, and payments of interest, should also be excluded because they are cancelled out by the discounting process.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Categories of cash flow</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The cash flows in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img58">Table 4.2</a> are in the sequence in which the items in the example were originally presented. This was deliberate to facilitate reference between the problem, the solution and the explanations. However, as already discussed in the explanations, different cash flows are subject to different accounting (and tax) treatment and these differences will be significant for some of the analyses that we shall do later. For this reason, it makes sense to group like items together and to subtotal them as in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a>. Three categories are appropriate. These are cash flows arising from changes to, respectively:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>fixed capital;</li>
<li>working capital;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">operating income and outgoings.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img69" src="images/img69.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1021" height="1500"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The terms ‘fixed capital’ and ‘working capital’ refer to things that affect the statement of financial position. Their characteristics were described earlier in this chapter. ‘Operating income and outgoings’ refers to things that affect the income statement as well as affecting cash flows.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch04-7">IS IT A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">What is the sign of the number in the bottom right-hand corner of <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a>? It is positive, which means that in cash terms the benefits of undertaking the proposed investment exceed the costs. If the sign were negative, it would mean that, even in cash terms, we should be worse off making the change than staying as we are. The evaluation methods we shall be considering in the next two chapters have the effect, at best, of leaving that total number unchanged and, at worst, of making it smaller or even negative. So, a financial case that showed a negative total at this point would need to be substantially revised to make it worthy of further consideration.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">The positive total in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a> tells us that in cash terms we should be CU235k better off by undertaking the investment than by not doing so. However, even though the number is indeed positive, is it big enough to make the investment worthwhile? What the whole bottom line tells us is that if we invest net cash of CU560k, over a four-year period we should get our money back plus CU235k. Even before doing any calculating, gut-feel probably tells us that that seems like a reasonable investment. Not spectacular, but reasonable – at least worth exploring a little further. The various investment appraisal methods, to be discussed in the following two chapters, allow us to undertake this exploration.</span></p>

<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="boxText2">The main points covered in this chapter, linked to its objectives, have been the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">We have made decisions about the cash flows to go into a financial case, in incremental cash flow form, containing as many as possible of the elements typical of a proposed IT investment.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">We have experienced the difficulties that can arise in making those decisions. The difficulties can be minimised by adherence to the rules summarised in the next bullet point.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">It is usual to include in a cash flow financial case only cash flows that will occur if the proposed investment is undertaken, or continues, but will not occur if not. Consequently, the following are usually excluded: sunk costs (and ‘sunk benefits’), depreciation and losses on sale, and cross-charges. ‘Financial’ cash flows are also excluded.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">We have built up a set of data to which we shall refer in subsequent chapters.</span></li>
