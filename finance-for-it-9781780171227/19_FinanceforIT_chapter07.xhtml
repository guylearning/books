<p class="chapterTitle">7 THE EFFECTS OF TAXATION</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">This topic has been included for the sake of completeness. However, it can safely be skipped by those concerned with non-taxable organisations. Guidance on tax matters should always be sought from a qualified person.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch07-1">OBJECTIVES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="italic">When you have studied this chapter you should be able to:</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="italic">explain why it is important to understand the effects of taxation on IT and other investments undertaken by tax-paying organisations;</span></li>
<li><span class="italic">describe representative principles of company (corporation) tax;</span></li>
<li><span class="italic">describe representative effects of corporation tax on the profit and cash flows of a proposed IT, or other, investment;</span></li>
<li class="bullet-last"><span class="italic">describe, using the above representative principles, the after-tax value added to shareholders by the investment, and its after-tax NPV, IRR, payback and ROI</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">A financial case cannot be said to be fully evaluated until all the income and outgoings attributable to it have been taken into account. One major attributable factor not so far considered is taxation. The rules of business (and personal) taxation vary from country to country. In an ‘international’ book it is therefore neither possible nor appropriate to go into much detail. Equally, if the topic is to be covered at all, then it should be illustrated by examples, and representative examples will be used. However, it must be stressed that they are indeed for illustration only.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch07-2">BUSINESS TAX</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Why bother with taxation when evaluating an investment opportunity? The answer is that tax affects both the profit and the cash flow of a business. If the investment is profitable, then extra tax will be payable as a result. It is the after-tax profit of the company that finally belongs to the shareholders. After-tax profit is thus the ultimate measure of value that has been added to the shareholders by the business as a whole. It is also, therefore, the measure of what the investment being evaluated will contribute to that result. The representative illustrations of business taxation that follow are based on companies and company (corporation) tax.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">What is taxed?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Companies are taxed on their profits. This usually means their revenue (whether received in cash or not), less the expenses (whether paid in cash or not) incurred in achieving it. Most of the expenses incurred by a company may be ‘tax-allowable’, including interest. Of business expenses not tax-allowable, the most significant are likely to be expenditure on, and depreciation of, non-current assets. Where ‘accounting depreciation’ is disallowed then businesses may be able to claim some compensating deduction (which as a generalisation I shall call ‘depreciation allowances’ – see below) at legislated standard rates. In some countries it is either the rule or the custom for accounting depreciation to be the same as depreciation allowances.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">If a company’s expenses and any depreciation allowances together exceed its revenue it is said to have made a ‘tax loss’. In the case of a group of companies, it may be possible to set a tax loss in one company against the profits of other companies in the same group. It may also be possible for tax losses to be carried forward to be set against future profits, or even against past profits, resulting in a refund of tax paid. <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img109">Figure 7.1</a> illustrates what is meant by ‘taxable profit’ and ‘tax loss’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">So, the profits of companies have to be adjusted in order to arrive at the ‘taxable profit’, the amount on which they are actually taxed. For example, assume the summary of a company’s results as shown in <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img110">Table 7.1</a>. In this example, assuming a corporation tax rate of 30 per cent, the tax payable by the company would be 30 per cent of its taxable profit of CU21 million (= CU6.3 million). In the examples that follow, it will be assumed that tax is payable in the year following that to which it relates.</span></p>

<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch07-3">‘DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCES’</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Why, in some countries, is accounting depreciation not a ‘tax-allowable’ expense? The clue to the answer lies in the earlier discussion of depreciation in <a href="15_FinanceforIT_chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>. Concerning non-current assets, the general rule is that the cost of the asset less any expected eventual sale proceeds should be depreciated over the asset’s expected useful life. What ‘useful life’ means in any particular business is generally for the individual business person to decide; so is the method of depreciation to be used, although whatever is done must be done consistently.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">So, ‘accounting depreciation’ of a non-current asset in any year is what a particular business person decides it will be. Understandably, some tax authorities are not willing for so subjective an item of expense to be allowed as a deduction in calculating taxable profit. Some governments therefore legislate standard ‘tax depreciation’ rates for tax purposes that are applicable to all companies, regardless of their individual accounting policies. It is these that I have referred to as ‘depreciation allowances’. As already stated, representative examples will be used to illustrate the principles.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Representative depreciation allowance rates</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In the examples that follow, it will be assumed that the depreciation allowance rate for IT equipment is 25 per cent of cost in the year of acquisition, followed by 25 per cent of the remaining balance (the ‘tax book value’ (TBV)) in subsequent years until disposal. It will also be assumed that the depreciation allowance given in the year of disposal, a ‘balancing allowance’, is equal to the tax book value (cost less depreciation allowances so far), less any proceeds of sale. As an illustration of the above assumptions, <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img111-1">Figure 7.2</a> shows, in percentage terms, the depreciation allowances on an asset purchased in Year 0 and scrapped in Year 3.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img111-1" src="images/img111-1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="935"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">An example</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A numeric example should help to make all this clear. Suppose that a company pays corporation tax at 30 per cent on its taxable profit. Assume an IT asset purchased for CU1000 in Year 0 and eventually sold for CU100 in Year 3. <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img111-2">Table 7.2</a> shows the depreciation allowances and the resulting decrease in corporation tax payable. You have all the information you need in order to work it out for yourself. <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img112">Figure 7.3</a> shows the answer diagrammatically.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img111-2" src="images/img111-2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="909"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img112" src="images/img112.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="956"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The final amount of −CU630 in the total column of <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img111-2">Table 7.2</a> represents the net-of-tax cost of the asset over its life from Years 0 to 3. It is the net total of the cost, less the proceeds of sale and less the ‘tax relief’. Notice that the total tax relief given (CU270) is 30 per cent of the net cost (CU900) of the asset (that is, its cost less the proceeds of sale). This reflects what may be the intention of the rules: that over an asset’s life its net cost will, through the mechanism of depreciation allowances, be deducted from taxable profit.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">What would happen if, in Year 3, the asset were sold, not for CU100 but for CU500, more than the tax book value? The answer is that instead of a balancing allowance that reduces tax payable that year, there might be a ‘balancing charge’ (of CU78.12) that would increase the tax payable. The balancing charge would be the difference between the tax book value of CU421.88 and the proceeds of sale of CU500. This is all set out in <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img113">Table 7.3</a>. The net tax relief given (CU150) is still 30 per cent of what is now the net cost (CU500) of the asset.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">I have assumed it to be a feature of ‘depreciation allowances’ that there is no apportionment based on time. An asset acquired even on the last day of a business’s accounting year qualifies for the full depreciation allowance that year, resulting in a reduction of taxable profit equal to 25 per cent of the asset’s cost, or such other first year allowance percentage rate as may be in force. This is unlike other business expenses, deducted from revenue to arrive at taxable profit, which are apportioned over the period(s) to which they relate.</p>

<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText2">So far in this chapter we have covered the first two of its objectives. In particular:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have discussed why it is desirable for tax-paying organisations to take tax into account in evaluating IT and other investment opportunities;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have learned, in general terms, some representative principles of company taxation;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have seen why accounting depreciation is often not allowed as a ‘tax- deductible’ expense, and how government-imposed ‘depreciation allowances’ may be deductible instead.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch07-4"><span class="no-style-override">HOW DOES TAX AFFECT AN IT FINANCIAL CASE?</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">We can now return to Example 4.1 and see how our proposed investment might be affected by tax. Please turn again to <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a>. In the previous chapter, under the subheading ‘How to calculate average profit’, we noted that of the three categories of cash flow shown in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml#img69">Table 4.6</a> (fixed capital, working capital and operating cash flows) only the first- and last-named affect operating profit. Changes to working capital usually represent simply the conversion of one kind of asset to another; for example, receivables into cash, or cash into inventory. Such changes affect the statement of financial position but not the income statement, at least not directly.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The two categories that do affect operating profit were fixed capital and operating cash flows. Since businesses are taxed on the basis of profit, it follows that those same two categories will also affect tax. We shall examine the tax effects of each of them in turn, starting with operating cash flows.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Tax effect of operating cash flows</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">You will recall that by the expedient of ignoring timing differences we have been able to treat changes to operating cash inflows and outflows as though they were the same as changes to operating revenues and expenses. The operating cash flows in each of the years 1 to 4 are positive, and come to a total of CU765k. That means that they all, in their guise of net revenues, have the effect of increasing profit by CU765k. If something causes a company’s profit to increase, what happens to the amount of tax that it has to pay? It too increases.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Assuming a rate of corporation tax of 30 per cent, how much extra tax is therefore payable as a result of the increased profit? The answer is given in <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img114">Table 7.4</a>. Not, I think you will agree, a very complicated calculation. The increase in tax payable caused by the investment would be the increased profit multiplied by the tax rate.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img114" src="images/img114.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="575"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Tax effect of fixed capital cash flows</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">How, in the previous chapter, did the fixed capital cash flows affect the profit? The answer, you will recall, was through the mechanism of depreciation. But we now know that depreciation may not be a tax-deductible expense. Instead, we may be able to deduct ‘depreciation allowances’. We have already worked through a couple of examples of depreciation allowances, so for this part of the exercise we just need to repeat the calculations but with different numbers, plus one additional consideration, just to keep it interesting.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Assuming, as above, a tax rate of 30 per cent and a depreciation allowance rate of 25 per cent, how much less tax is payable as a result of the depreciation allowances? <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img115">Table 7.5</a> shows the answer. The reduction in tax payable caused by the investment would be the depreciation allowances multiplied by the tax rate.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img115" src="images/img115.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1032"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Remember that we are seeking all the relevant incremental cash flows that would result from the investment. These include the tax cash flows. We have seen that depreciation allowances in the year of disposal of an asset are reduced by any proceeds of sale. The treatment of the proceeds of the old equipment in <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img115">Table 7.5</a> is based on the assumption that any sale value in Year 0 would diminish to zero by the following year if the project to replace it were not undertaken. If we include the sale proceeds as a benefit attributable to the project (which we have done), then we should include the reduction in depreciation allowance as an attributable cost.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For the sake of simplicity I have ignored what would in reality be different timings of the depreciation allowances and put the whole reduction in Year 0. The resulting slight sacrifice of accuracy is trivial.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The tax cash flows</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">We have now worked out both the increase in tax payable resulting from the increased profit, and the reduction in tax payable resulting from the depreciation allowances. It is now only necessary to combine these two results in order to establish the net tax cash flows attributable to the investment. These are shown in <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img116">Table 7.6</a>. In the bottom line of the table, positive numbers represent reductions in tax payable; negative numbers represent increases. If you did the workings for yourself, did you remember the ‘tax delay’ of a year? It means that tax cash flows generally occur in the year following that to which they relate.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">As a result of the tax delay, ‘Year 5’ has crept into <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img116">Table 7.6</a>. There is an endless debate about whether tax cash flows occurring after the chosen end date of an investment evaluation should be included or excluded. On the one hand, they are undeniably cash flows attributable to the investment. On the other hand, if you include tax cash flows, then why not also include other cash flows that occur outside the evaluation period? These would in turn give rise to further tax effects. The fact is that some people do it one way, others do it the other way. I have included Year 5 only to raise the point.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img116" src="images/img116.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="788"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The deciding factor is often the purely practical one that a spreadsheet designed to evaluate a four-year project will usually be given six columns: one each for Years 0 to 4 and one for the totals. Anything, including a tax cash flow, that doesn’t belong in Years 0 to 4 is simply ignored. Because of depreciation allowances, the tax cash flow in the last year of a typical IT evaluation is often positive. It might be regarded as a pity that a positive cash flow should be lost solely because of the vagaries of spreadsheet design. You may find here echoes of the earlier debate about whether to include the effects of benefits that will outlast the technology on which an application is initially implemented. Total accuracy is not achievable. As always, consistency is the important thing.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">We worked through the tax effects in the above particular way because the step-by-step approach made them easier to understand. We could instead have deducted the depreciation allowances from the increases in net revenues and then worked out tax at 30 per cent on the resulting net numbers. Arithmetically, this would have given the same answer that we arrived at in <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img116">Table 7.6</a>.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch07-5">AFTER-TAX EVALUATION OF AN INVESTMENT</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">We established at the beginning of this chapter that incremental tax cash flows are just as relevant to an investment, and therefore attributable to it, as any other cash flows. It follows that they are usually, but not necessarily, taken into account in evaluating an investment proposal.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">After-tax cost of capital</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml">5</a> we discussed the concepts of cost of money (capital) and ‘opportunity cost of money’. We noted that the opportunity cost of using our own personal money is not the gross interest rate that we should otherwise have received on it if invested, but the net-of-tax interest rate. By contrast, if we are using borrowed money, our personal ‘cost of money’ is the gross interest rate that we are paying. This is because we assumed that interest on personal borrowings is not ‘tax-deductible’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> we noted one of the main differences between personal tax and business tax: namely that business interest may be tax-deductible. Dividend payments to shareholders, however, are usually not. These facts in a particular country should obviously be taken into account in doing any after-tax evaluation.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">We need to compare like with like. In order to determine the real value of after-tax cash flows, we should measure them against the after-tax cost of capital. To see how this is done we shall revisit the example that we used in <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>. In that example, which assumed unequal quantities of equity and debt, the cost of equity was assumed to be 12 per cent; the cost of debt eight per cent. We shall now, just for a change, assume equal quantities of equity and debt. What are now the before- and after-tax costs of capital, assuming a tax rate of 30 per cent? <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img117">Table 7.7</a> shows the answer. The table shows that the before-tax cost is, of course, 10 per cent. The after-tax cost is 8.8 per cent. This will be the discount rate for working out the after-tax NPV of our example, except that to facilitate use of the discount table we shall use the nearest whole-number figure of nine per cent. I repeat my earlier suggestion that, in practice, you would find out from your finance department or finance person what discount rate to use, and whether it is before-tax or after-tax.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img117" src="images/img117.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="604"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">After-tax NPV and IRR</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">We now have all that we need in order to work out the after-tax evaluations of our proposed investment: the before-tax cash flows, the tax cash flows and the after-tax cost of capital (nine per cent). We shall start with the NPV. The answer (CU66,900) is given in <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img118">Table 7.8</a>.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img118" src="images/img118.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="853"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) is worked out by exactly the same method used earlier to obtain the before-tax value, referred to in <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, and illustrated in <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img81">Figure 5.2</a>. You could try it for yourself using the same method. I shall not use space by simply repeating <a href="17_FinanceforIT_chapter05.xhtml#img81">Figure 5.2</a> with different numbers. Suffice it to say that the precise answer, given by financial calculator or spreadsheet function, is 14.8 per cent. Using the ‘trial and error’ approach, the discount rate of nine per cent used above gave an NPV of CU67k; a discount rate of 22 per cent gives an NPV of −CU67k. The rate midway between nine per cent and 22 per cent is 15.5 per cent, which could be taken as a reasonable approximation of the after-tax IRR.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">After-tax SVA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The after-tax SVA (CU74,500) is shown in <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img119">Table 7.9</a>. Its NPV of CU66,900 is of course the same as the NPV of the project cash flows in <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img118">Table 7.8</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">After-tax payback and ROI</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The after-tax payback and discounted payback can also be worked out with the methods used earlier to obtain the before-tax results. The answers are 28.8 months and 37.2 months respectively. ROI is sometimes, but not necessarily, confined to being used as a before-tax evaluation tool. This is probably because a major use of ROI is to determine the effect of a proposed investment on a departmental budget. Departmental budgets do not usually get charged with tax. I have, however, done the ROI after-tax calculations and they are shown in <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img120-1">Tables 7.10</a>–<a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img120-3">7.12</a>.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch07-6">THE RESULTS COMPARED</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml#img121">Table 7.13</a> summarises the results of all the evaluations we have done on Example 4.1, before tax and, where appropriate, after tax.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img119" src="images/img119.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1203" height="1300"/></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch07-7">TAXATION AND LEASING</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Depending on the kind of lease, ‘depreciation allowances’ would often be claimable by the owner, the ‘head lessor’, which would deduct them, together with its allowable expenses, from its revenues to determine its taxable profit.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, we shall be looking at the subject of leasing, and specifically IT leasing. One benefit of leasing to lessees (users) is that it may make tax accounting easier. This is because, for tax purposes, payments under at least some kinds of lease may be treated as tax-deductible expenses in computing taxable profit. Some adjustments may have to be made but, despite that, expenses are generally regarded as easier to handle than ‘depreciation allowances’.</p>

<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="boxText2">The main points covered in this chapter, linked to its objectives, have been the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>After-tax profit is what ultimately belongs to company shareholders. Therefore the effects of taxation are usually included in any evaluation of IT or other investment opportunities that will contribute towards that profit.</li>
<li>Tax is payable on business profits, adjusted for disallowed expenses, which may include depreciation. If so, then government-imposed ‘depreciation allowances’ may be deductible instead to arrive at taxable profit.</li>
<li>IT and other investments typically have two significant effects on business profits, and therefore on tax. Increased net revenues result in more tax being payable; depreciation allowances, if applicable, cause less tax to be payable.</li>
<li>In using discounted cash flow to evaluate investment opportunities, after-tax evaluations should be done using the organisation’s after-tax cost of capital, so that like is being compared with like.</li>
