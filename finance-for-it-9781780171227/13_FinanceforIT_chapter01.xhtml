<p class="chapterTitle">1 FINANCE AND ACCOUNTS: THE BASICS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief summary of the fundamentals of finance and accounting, and to introduce their terminology sufficiently to enable people with no previous knowledge of the subject to understand the rest of the book. For this chapter a ‘minimalist’ approach in note form has been adopted in order to focus on the fundamentals in the minimum of space. Readers who are familiar with these fundamentals, but who may be less familiar with the terminology of international accounting standards, may find it useful to skim this chapter.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent1">The principles explained in this book evolved to facilitate business, and it is business that will provide the context for the explanations. However, any organisation can and should be run in a business-like way. Therefore it should not be surprising that the same principles are equally applicable to non-business organisations – government, academia, charities, associations and clubs – although with differences of detail.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">As stated in the Preface, this is intended as an international book. It therefore uses the terminology of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). <a href="12_FinanceforIT_preface.xhtml#imgxix">Table P.1</a> in the Preface shows every IFRS term used in the book together with the equivalent term used in previous editions. To further assist readers, the first time that an IFRS term appears in the text the previously used term is given in brackets, as in the third, fifth and sixth bullets above. The same is done in the Glossary at the end of the book.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-2">THE PURPOSE OF BUSINESS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The main purpose of a business is to create wealth for the owner or owners. It is helpful to think of a business, even a one-person business, as a separate entity from its owners. In the case of companies this principle is enshrined in law. A company is a separate legal entity. Its owners are called shareholders.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">A business may be run by an individual (a ‘sole trader’), by a group of individuals working together (a ‘partnership’) or by a limited company.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Sole traders and partners, except those in a ‘limited liability partnership’ where such are permitted, are liable for all the debts of a business. If necessary, all their personal assets can be required to pay those debts.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">Where they are permitted, limited liability partnerships are halfway between traditional partnerships and companies, combining the flexibility of the former with the protection of limited liability associated with the latter.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-3">COMPANIES OR CORPORATIONS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The main purpose of a company or corporation is to limit the liability of the owners (‘shareholders’) to the money that they have invested in it; they may lose that, but nothing else.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">Shareholders invest money in a company in return for ‘shares’; the shareholders exercise control and are entitled to profits in proportion to the number of their shares.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The shareholders appoint ‘directors’ (who may also be shareholders) to run the business on their behalf and to report back to them the results and ‘accounts’ at least once a year.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The shareholders also appoint ‘auditors’ to tell them whether the accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and its ‘profit’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Profit means the ‘revenue’ (income) earned by a business, less the expenses incurred in earning it.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Profit belongs ultimately to the shareholders, but usually only a part is paid to them each year as a ‘dividend’. The rest is retained in the business to finance expansion.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">It is not compulsory to pay a dividend. The directors recommend how much, if any, they think the company can afford.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Most companies are ‘private’ companies’, many of which are family businesses.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">‘Public’ companies are those authorised to offer their shares to members of the public. They are subject to more stringent regulations than private companies. Only the shares of public companies may be ‘listed’ on a stock exchange.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Other advantages of companies over unincorporated businesses include: additional money may more easily be raised, in exchange for more shares; shares can be bought and sold; there may be tax advantages.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Where companies obtain money</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Finance means the management (the raising, custody and spending) of money.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">There are three main sources of long-term finance for a company: money invested by shareholders, called ‘share capital’; borrowings (money borrowed from banks or other lenders); and profit retained in the business (called ‘retained profit’).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The profit left after paying all expenses, including interest and tax, belongs to the shareholders. Share capital and retained earnings together are known as ‘equity’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">A company is thus obligated to others for all its money: to its shareholders for its equity (its share capital and retained earnings); to its lenders for borrowings.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Borrowings must usually be repaid by a fixed date. Those repayable more than one year in the future are described as ‘non-current liabilities’; those repayable in one year or less are ‘current liabilities’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In the course of trading, a company will incur other current liabilities as well, for example ‘trade payables’ (trade creditors) – suppliers from whom it has bought on credit.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Eventually, although perhaps far into the future, when the company is liquidated or ‘wound up’, anything left after all debts have been paid will be repaid to the then shareholders.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meanwhile, the total of the long-term money used by a company (share capital plus long-term borrowings) is sometimes called its ‘capital employed’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Liabilities, whether short- or long-term, are obligations that a business owes.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">What companies do with money</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Some businesses, for example small consultancies, need very little money in order to get started and to remain in business. All they need is people and perhaps a rented office.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Others, for example car manufacturers, need a great deal of money. They have to acquire buildings and manufacturing plant. They also have to stock up with inventories (stocks) of parts and components. All these things are called ‘assets’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Most businesses fall somewhere in between these extremes.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Assets, like liabilities, may be short-term (current) or long-term (non-current). Here, too, ‘non-current’ means more than one year.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Most non-current assets are used up over time, as is therefore the money used to acquire them. IT equipment and motor vehicles are examples. To replace them requires more money. Not all non-current assets are used up, however. Land is an example.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Accounts often, but not necessarily, record the using up, or ‘depreciation’, of non-current assets on a ‘straight line’ basis (as though it happened by equal amounts each year). However, other methods are permitted.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Assets do not have to be bought. Many of them, including IT assets, can be leased. Instead of a single initial cash outlay, regular payments are made during the life of the asset. Thus, leasing is a way of conserving cash.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Short-term assets are called ‘current assets’. ‘Inventories’ (stocks) are current assets; so are ‘trade receivables’ (trade debtors), which are amounts due from customers to whom goods or services have been sold on credit. Cash is also a current asset.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Current assets are used up or ‘turned over’, usually over short periods of less than a year. Unlike non-current assets, they are continually replenished out of the revenue from sales.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">‘Fixed capital’ is a term often used to describe that part of a company’s money (‘capital’) invested in non-current (long-term) assets.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">‘Working capital’ is a term often used to describe that part of a company’s capital invested in net current assets (current assets less current liabilities).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">‘Goodwill’ is an intangible asset that may arise when one business buys another. It is the amount by which the price paid for the business exceeds the values of the assets less liabilities acquired. It is the amount that the buyer is willing to pay for the good name or the ‘know-how’ of the business.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Assets, whether short- or long-term, are things that a business owns.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-4">HOW A BUSINESS WORKS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">How a business works financially is best understood by working through an example. This we shall be doing for the remainder of this chapter, considering one by one, in Example 1.1, a series of common business transactions: seeing how they are recorded and their financial effect.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">To do this, we shall use as an example a small manufacturing company just starting up. Imagine that you are the only shareholder.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Getting started</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">You have started the company by opening a bank account for it and paying in CU100k of your own money in exchange for CU100k worth of shares. Every transaction has two sides. For example, you sell, I buy; I lend, you borrow. Accounting systems record both sides of every transaction.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img5">Table 1.1</a> is one way of showing how this first transaction has affected the company. It shows that it has acquired an asset, cash, of CU100k; also that it is indebted to you for the capital that you have invested. This indebtedness (your stake in the business) is called ‘equity’. Notice how both sides of the transaction have been recorded.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img5" src="images/img5.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="649"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img5">Table 1.1</a> is called a ‘statement of financial position’. A statement of financial position is a statement of the assets and liabilities of a business at a moment in time. It is a snapshot. It always ‘balances’ because both sides of every transaction are always recorded. Hence the older term ‘balance sheet’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Suppose that in addition to your own CU100k you estimate that you need a further CU150k in order to get started. Friends are willing to invest, but you only accept, say, a further CU80k from them in return for issuing more shares.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">If the friends together had more shares than you, then you would lose control, because they could then out-vote you. Each share carries one vote. There can be other kinds of share, called ‘preference shares’, which may not carry a vote, but the great majority of shares are ‘ordinary shares’ – one share one vote. The company now has CU180k in cash and the shareholders’ equity is now CU180k.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The remaining CU70k you raise from the bank as a long-term loan. <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img6-1">Table 1.2</a> shows what the statement of financial position now looks like. The company now has CU250k in cash.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In most businesses, the holding of cash is a means to an end. You have set up your company in order to manufacture, so you buy a factory for CU90k and some plant for CU60k. You could have leased both, but we shall assume that you bought them outright.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img6-1" src="images/img6-1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="830"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img6-2">Table 1.3</a> shows your financial position now. Where the money came from (the equity and the loan) has not changed. However, what the business is doing with its money has changed. In this case, it has converted part of one asset, called ‘cash’, into other assets, called ‘factory’ and ‘plant’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img7">Table 1.4</a> improves readability by differentiating between the short-term (current) and the long-term (non-current) assets. Remember that ‘long-term’ means more than one year; ‘short-term’ means one year or less.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img6-2" src="images/img6-2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="953"/></p>

<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-5">EXAMPLE 1.1 PART 1: HOW TRANSACTIONS AFFECT THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The company is now ready to start business. We shall proceed through a series of simple business transactions, see how they are recorded and examine their financial effect: the changes that they cause to the statement of financial position. Every business transaction changes its financial position, although in practice, of course, a new physical statement is not produced after every transaction. Doing so here forces us to look at one transaction at a time and is only for illustration.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The transactions, described below, are numbered 1 to 14. The effect of each transaction is recorded in a correspondingly numbered column in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img8">Table 1.5</a>. Should you wish to work out the effects for yourself, then it is a simple matter to draw a rough version of <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img8">Table 1.5</a> or produce a simple spreadsheet.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Look at the first column, headed (iv). It shows the financial position as we left it in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img7">Table 1.4</a> and represents the situation just before the start of trading by the company. Note that the liabilities also have been categorised into short-term (current) and long-term (non-current). The difference between the total assets and the total liabilities is the total equity. The few additional lines will be explained as we come to them.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Alternatively, simply continue reading the transactions as text, referring to the table as you do so. After each transaction in the text, there is a paragraph explaining how it was treated in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img8">Table 1.5</a> and why.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img8" src="images/img8.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1500" height="1166"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Whether or not you attempt the answers yourself, please note especially, as you proceed, what happens to the ‘cash’ and ‘profit’ lines.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Assume that there is an unlimited overdraft facility. An overdraft is a liability, usually short-term, and is therefore shown as such.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In each numbered column, the boxed items are those that have changed as a result of the correspondingly numbered transaction.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The transactions</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(1) The company buys raw materials for CU60k on credit.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">Column 1 shows how transaction 1 has changed the financial position. A new asset, raw materials, has been acquired and a new liability incurred: a trade payable, the obligation to pay the supplier. The column totals change as a result.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(2) <span class="no-style-override-7">Product is manufactured, using CU40k of raw materials and paying labour costs of CU60k. Suppose this results in CU90k of finished goods and CU10k of partly finished goods, called ‘work in progress’. </span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">Here, two kinds of asset (raw materials and cash) have been converted into two other kinds of asset (finished and partly finished goods). For the purpose of this simple example, we shall assume that no other costs have been incurred, so that the finished goods and work in progress are valued at the cost of the materials and labour that have gone into them. No extra liabilities have been incurred and none has been discharged, so the column totals are unchanged.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(3) <span class="no-style-override-7"> CU60k worth of finished goods are sold on credit for CU96k.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">Finished goods have been sold at a profit of CU36k. They have been converted into a higher-value asset called ‘trade receivables’: the right to receive payment for things sold. The profit has increased the total equity. The column totals have changed. Some subsequent transactions will cause the amount of profit, and therefore the equity, to change again.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(4) <span class="no-style-override-7"> The company pays various administrative expenses totalling CU20k. Sometimes called ‘overheads’, these include salespeople’s and admin staff’s salaries (assume CU10k) and other expenses. These details will be needed later.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">You will recall from earlier in this chapter that ‘profit’ means income less expenses, so these expenses reduce profit, and therefore equity, by CU20k. The asset ‘cash’ is also reduced by CU20k.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(5) <span class="no-style-override-7"> The company pays the raw materials supplier CU60k.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">The asset ‘cash’ is being used to extinguish a liability (the trade payable). In order to do this, the company has had, for the first time, to draw on its overdraft facility.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(6) <span class="no-style-override-7"> The company replenishes its supply of raw materials for CU40k on credit. </span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">This is similar to transaction 1. The asset and liability totals have increased by CU40k, but there is no change to the equity because the profit to date has not been affected.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(7) <span class="no-style-override-7"> The company receives CU50k from its customers.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">Part of the asset ‘trade receivables’ has been converted into the asset ‘cash’, and the overdraft is temporarily paid off. Notice that in credit businesses profit is nearly always regarded as earned at the time a sale is made (see <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#tran">transaction 3</a>), not when the customer pays. Only in cash businesses, such as market traders or taxi drivers, do the two things usually occur simultaneously.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(8) <span class="no-style-override-7"> The company discovers that a customer who owes CU1k has gone bankrupt and will be unable to pay.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">This represents a ‘bad debt’ or ‘uncollectible’. The asset ‘trade receivables’ is no longer worth CU46k, but only CU45k. The bad debt is an expense and, like any other expense, it reduces profit. Notice that it can only be recorded when it becomes apparent; no business sells to a customer knowing that they won’t pay.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(9) <span class="no-style-override-7"> More product is manufactured, using CU40k of raw materials and paying wages of CU60k.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">This is similar to transaction 2, except that now CU100k of finished product will result. Assuming that the business is now in a steady state the amount of work in progress will stay roughly the same, ‘old’ work in progress becoming finished product and being replaced by ‘new’ work in progress of a similar amount.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(10) <span class="no-style-override-7"> CU80k worth of finished goods are sold on credit for CU128k.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3" id="tran">This is similar to transaction 3, except for the amounts. The profit is CU48k and, as before, is recognised at the time the sale is made, not when the customer pays.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(11) <span class="no-style-override-7"> The business pays administrative expenses of CU24k. Assume that this includes CU12k of salespeople’s and admin staff’s salaries.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">This is similar to transaction 4, except for the amounts.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(12) <span class="no-style-override-7"> The raw materials suppliers are paid in full.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">This is similar to transaction 5.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(13) <span class="no-style-override-7"> The company replenishes its supply of raw materials for CU40k on credit.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">This is similar to transactions 1 and 6.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(14) <span class="no-style-override-7"> The remainder of the earlier customers pay their bills (CU46k less the bad debt CU1k), as do half (CU64k) of the latest ones.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent3">This results in a cash inflow of CU(45k + 64k) = CU109k, not quite enough to pay off the overdraft.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">That concludes the recording of the transactions that, I think you will agree, are representative of many of the everyday transactions that occur in a real business. Indeed, since manufacturing is more complex than many businesses, you may have grappled with more complexity than was necessary.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Was the example difficult? I think not, once you had worked through a few of the transactions and understood what it was about. With the understanding gained, you should now be able to work out the financial effect of most of the transactions that occur in any business.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Cash and profit</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">At the beginning of the above exercise I suggested that you note especially what happened to the cash and to the profit as you worked through the transactions. <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img11">Figure 1.1</a> compares the cash and profit figures shown by statements of financial position 1 to 14.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The profit remains positive throughout the exercise, whereas the cash balance ranges between CU100k and −CU114k. Profit and cash are different things.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Why is this? Part of the answer is that many things have to be paid for (raw materials, wages and other expenses) before any cash is eventually received from customers for sales. The rest of the answer we shall consider shortly.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img11" src="images/img11.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="797"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">We shall now continue with Example 1.1 by considering some of the adjustments that usually have to be made to a statement of financial position to try to ensure that it matches reality as closely as possible.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText1"><span class="no-style-override-1">So far in this chapter we have covered the first four of its objectives. In particular:</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>we have discussed the purpose of business and why the concept of ‘limited liability’ has been vital to its development;</li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have described the three main sources of money for a business;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have defined a statement of financial position and determined why it balances;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have experienced building statements of financial position and have seen how they are affected by different business transactions.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="boxText"><span class="no-style-override-1">We have also considered some of the reasons why cash and profit are different. We shall look at others in the next part of the chapter.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-6">EXAMPLE 1.1 PART 2: TYPICAL ADJUSTMENTS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Suppose now that by the time of column 14 of <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img8">Table 1.5</a> the company has completed a year of trading and that you wish to know as precisely as possible its financial position. There is nothing particularly significant about one year; it is simply the period in respect of which financial reporting usually takes place.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">There are usually some adjustments that the company accountant would have to make, some of which have nothing directly to do with trading. Four typical such adjustments, designated (a) to (d), are described below, and their effects tabulated in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img12">Table 1.6</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">This table starts with the statement of financial position in column 14 of <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img8">Table 1.5</a>, which is as we left it at the end of Part 1 except for a couple of additional lines, which will be explained as we come to them. The table ends, after all the adjustments have been made, with the final statement of financial position for the period: in column 15.</span></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img12" src="images/img12.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1198" height="1300"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Once again, having glanced at the format of <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img12">Table 1.6</a>, you are recommended to try the exercise for yourself. The adjustments are as follows:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(a) The manufacturing plant will have depreciated with use. Suppose its estimated life is 10 years and that it will be worthless at the end of that period. Assume that the depreciation is deemed to occur evenly over the 10-year period. This is known as ‘straight line’ depreciation.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">On this basis the depreciation will be CU6k per annum (= CU60k/10). What is the other side of this transaction? The approximate answer, adopted for the sake of simplicity in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img12">Table 1.6</a>, is to deduct it all from profit.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">However, depreciation of plant is actually another cost (together with raw materials and labour) of manufacture. In reality, therefore, the depreciation of plant should be split proportionally, as shown in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img14">Table 1.7</a>, among all the things manufactured: work in progress, inventory of finished goods and goods sold.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">The statement of financial position values of work in progress and inventory of finished goods would in practice therefore be increased by CU0.3k and CU1.5k respectively. Profit would only be reduced by CU4.2k, the additional cost of the goods sold, not by the full CU6k, as we have done. This deliberate inaccuracy has been perpetrated only for simplicity and to maintain whole numbers in the example.</span></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img14" src="images/img14.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="656"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">There is a sense in which all expenses represent the using up of assets. For example, the expense called ‘wages’ represents the using up of the right to an employee’s labour over a given period. Depreciation (the using up of non-current assets) is perhaps one of the more obvious illustrations of that principle.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(b) Assume you know that you owe the bank approximately CU7k in interest on the loan and the overdraft so far, although it has not yet been charged. This is for illustration only: in reality interest would probably be charged monthly.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">An expense is an expense, whether it has yet been paid in cash or not. Interest (the price to be paid for the right to use someone else’s money during a given period) becomes an expense as the right is used. Our aim is to determine the true state of affairs of the company, so the CU7k is an ‘other payable’ and is also deducted from the profit.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">It could possibly be argued that the CU7k should be added to the overdraft balance. However, since it has not yet been charged by the bank that would distort the actual cash position.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(c) In <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img8">Table 1.5</a> transaction 11, let us suppose that included in the CU24k paid for expenses, all of which was deducted from profit, was CU2k for insurance. You realise now that that payment was for insurance cover for the following whole year.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The general principle is that the accounts of a year should only be burdened with expenses that relate to that year. The CU2k therefore represents a payment in advance or ‘prepayment’. Profit, having thus been wrongly reduce by CU2k, is now corrected by a corresponding increase of CU2k.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">This right to receive future services already paid for is just as much an asset as is, for example, ‘trade receivables’, which is the right to receive cash for goods already sold.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(d) You estimate that corporation tax payable on the profit so far will be CU10k.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Tax is an expense, the price payable for making a profit, that will eventually have to be paid. So, the tax authority is a ‘payable’; not a ‘trade payable’ but an ‘other payable’. Profit is correspondingly reduced.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Summary of Example 1.1, Parts 1 and 2</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Having made the above adjustments, column 15 in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img12">Table 1.6</a> shows the assets and liabilities of the company and its profit to date as accurately as possible. Note, however, some of the factors that make total accuracy impossible.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For example, depreciation can only be an approximation; the amounts of interest and tax owing are also only estimates. Note also that all the above adjustments (a) to (d) have only affected the profit figure; they did not affect cash.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Introduction to Parts 3 and 4</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">We have seen, in the example so far, that every transaction causes the financial position of a company to change. A new statement of financial position could be produced after every single transaction, as we have done, but to do so would be absurd. In practice, statements of financial position are usually produced at least yearly, and sometimes quarterly, for legal and taxation purposes, and monthly for internal use.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">At the same time, summaries are prepared of all the transactions that have affected profit and cash flow respectively since the previous statement of financial position or, in our example, since the start of the business. The summary of all the transactions that have affected profit is called an ‘income statement’ (profit and loss account); the summary of all the transactions that have affected cash is called a ‘statement of cash flows’ (cash flow statement).</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-7">EXAMPLE 1.1 PART 3: THE INCOME STATEMENT</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">An income statement is a summary of all the transactions that have affected profit since the previous statement of financial position or, as in this example, since the beginning of a business.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img16">Table 1.8</a> shows the income statement (Part 3 of Example 1.1) in a format based on that used in published accounts. It starts with revenue (turnover), which means income from sales. Then, all the costs and expenses of the business are deducted, starting with those most directly related to the goods or services sold. Notice the different levels of ‘profit’ described.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">With a little effort you should be able to produce the answer for yourself. All the information you need is in the earlier descriptions of the transactions and of the adjustments. Some items are self-explanatory; explanations of the others follow.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img16" src="images/img16.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1050"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Revenue (sales)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Revenue represents the income from goods (or services) sold, regardless of whether the customers have yet paid for them. Similarly, the items described under the two following headings represent costs incurred, whether or not they have yet been paid for.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Cost of sales</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These are the costs directly related to getting the goods or services sold during the period to a saleable state and location. In this simple example these consist of raw materials and labour costs of the goods actually sold, plus depreciation of the manufacturing plant. Remember that in the interests of keeping things simple we have charged the full CU6k of depreciation as part of cost of sales, whereas in practice it would have been split between cost of sales, stock of finished goods and work in progress.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">‘Gross profit’ is what is left after deducting cost of sales from revenue.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Administrative expenses</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These are the other expenses of running or ‘operating’ the business, excluding interest and other finance-related expenses. They are sometimes called ‘administrative overheads’ or just ‘overheads’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Operating profit</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">This is the profit made from running or ‘operating’ the business. Because it is the profit before deducting any finance-related expenses, it facilitates comparison between businesses whose operations are similar but which are financed in different ways.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Profit for the year</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Sometimes called ‘profit after tax’, this is the profit achieved from trading activities.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In practice, there may be other, non-trading, items of income and expense, for example currency gains or losses on exchange. These, together with ‘profit for the year’, are recorded in what is, in effect, a supplement to the income statement called a ‘statement of comprehensive income’. Its bottom line is the ‘total comprehensive income for the year’, which is the amount by which equity has increased. The purpose is to make very clear the distinction between the results of trading and non-trading activities.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The international accounting standards actually permit the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income to be combined into a single ‘statement of comprehensive income’. However, many people see merit in having a separate ‘income statement’ that records just the trading results of the business quite separately from any non-trading items.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Finally, in practice there is a further statement called a ‘statement of changes in equity’. This shows all the changes to equity during the year, including the total comprehensive income (or deficit) for the year, any dividends payable to shareholders and any other changes to equity, such as the issue of additional shares. You can see real examples of these statements in <a href="28_FinanceforIT_appendix3.xhtml">Appendix 3</a>.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-8"><span class="no-style-override">EXAMPLE 1.1 PART 4: THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A statement of cash flows is a summary of all the transactions that have affected the cash position since the previous statement of financial position or, as in our example, since the beginning of a business. Its purpose is similar to that of an income statement, but it deals with cash rather than profit.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img18">Table 1.9</a> shows the statement of cash flows resulting from our example, in a format based on one that is used in published accounts. It sets out the main headings under which cash has been received or paid, together with the amounts applicable to each heading. These should be self-explanatory.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">If you wish to try it for yourself, all the information you need is in the descriptions of the transactions given earlier in Part 1 of the example. It is not necessary to refer to the adjustments in Part 2 because none of them affected cash.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Remember to include all the items that affect cash, right from the very beginning of the business, before you had paid your CU100k into its newly opened bank account.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Note that we included interest and tax in the income statement, because they represented expenses incurred; they are excluded from the statement of cash flows because they have not yet been paid.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img18" src="images/img18.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1214" height="1300"/></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-9">RELATING CASH FLOW TO PROFIT</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">We have discussed the fact that, in all except purely cash businesses, cash and profit are different things. Nevertheless, they both concern the same business activities. It should therefore be possible to draw up a statement that relates the two. <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img19">Table 1.10</a> is such a statement.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Note that this table is simply another way of arriving at the ‘net cash flow from operating activities’. This approach is often adopted rather than the one shown in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img18">Table 1.9</a>. This is because in real situations all the data can usually be obtained by reference to the income statement and statement of financial position. With the first method this may not be the case. Brief explanations of each item follow.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img19" src="images/img19.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1034"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Depreciation charges</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These are expenses deducted in arriving at profit but not represented by cash payments.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Increase in inventories</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These are items for which cash has been or will be paid (see ‘increase in trade payables’ below), but which have not yet been charged against profit as part of ‘cost of sales’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Increase in trade payables</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">That part of the increase in inventories (above) not yet paid for in cash.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Increase in trade receivables and prepayments</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These are sales for which cash has not yet been received, and cash paid, for which services have not yet been received.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-10">PUBLISHED ACCOUNTS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">What would our results typically look like in a set of published accounts? <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img20">Table 1.11</a> shows our statement of financial position, very similar in form to the working version that we have been using, as it might appear in a company’s Annual Report. Remember that it is mainly the <span class="italic">published</span> accounts of listed companies that so far are required in many countries to be produced using international standards. The income statement is more or less in the form in which we have already considered it, as would be the statement of cash flows, which is not shown.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Notice that the statement of financial position has a few presentational differences from the working version that we have used thus far. The main difference is that figures for ‘total assets’ and ‘total liabilities’ are not shown. Instead, ‘net assets’ is shown, which is of course the difference between those two figures. While the accounting rules prescribe in some detail <span class="italic">what</span> must be shown in published accounts, they are less prescriptive about precisely <span class="italic">how</span> it is shown.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Note the non-bold italicised headings representing the five main sections into which the items on a statement of financial position are always divided. These are as already described, and in summary are: non-current assets, current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and equity.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Notes to the accounts</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In real published accounts, not all the information required by law can be given on the face of the statement of financial position, income statement and statement of cash flows. In a typical published Annual Report there are many pages of notes that provide more detail.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Consolidated accounts</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Many businesses consist not just of one company but of several companies in what is known as a group. Typically, there is one overall company, called the ‘parent company’ or ‘holding company’, that owns all or a majority of the shares in the others, which are known as ‘subsidiaries’. If published Annual Reports had to contain full accounts of all the companies in the group, the reports would in some cases run to hundreds of pages.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img20" src="images/img20.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="997" height="1600"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">So, for the purpose of reporting only, groups are permitted to produce ‘consolidated’ or ‘group’ accounts. These are simply the accounts of all the individual companies in the group combined or consolidated into a single statement of financial position, income statement and statement of cash flows etc. In published Annual Reports it is usually consolidated accounts that you will be looking at. This is because most public companies are groups. The principles of consolidated accounts are the same as those that we have considered in this chapter, except that ‘inter-company transactions’ within the group are eliminated to avoid double counting.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">There are situations where one company has a significant minority shareholding and therefore can exercise significant influence in another company but without having control. In this case, the other company is called an ‘associate’ of the investing company, and there are rules that determine how this is reflected in consolidated accounts.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Different kinds of business</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In this chapter we have used a manufacturing business to illustrate fundamental business and accounting principles. This is because manufacturing provides examples of all the main kinds of commercial transaction. The knowledge gained should help you to understand the accounts of any company. However, the more you know about the nature and jargon of the particular business of a company, the greater your understanding of its accounts is likely to be.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">What does it all mean?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The presentational style of statements of financial position, income statements and statements of cash flows has evolved to the point where it is difficult to see how any greater clarity could be achieved. Despite that, many people would say that these documents are static and, by themselves, tell us little about the dynamics of a business. The answer to this understandable criticism is that the dynamics are there, but that a bit of searching is necessary in order to find them. How to do this searching is the subject of <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-11">PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">To remind you, this opening chapter on ‘finance fundamentals’ has been included primarily for those who started by knowing nothing about the subject, in order to provide a context for understanding the rest of the book. The kind of accounting illustrated in this chapter is not only a legal requirement, but it also of course provides some useful information about where a business stands (financial position) and how it has performed (income statement and statement of cash flows). However, note the past tense in that last phrase. ‘Financial accounting and reporting’, as the name implies, mostly concerns the past. But what about the future?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">There is no legal requirement for a business to make plans and forecasts. However, the business that does not do so is almost certainly doomed to failure. Perhaps most important of all is the need continually to forecast and monitor cash flows, although other aspects of a business need to be planned and monitored as well. For example, if you have not estimated how much of your product you think you can sell, then how can you know how much of it to buy or to manufacture, what facilities you will need, how many people to employ and what skills they should have? Equally, unless you estimate your costs, how can you work out what your selling price must be in order to make a reasonable profit? Price, in turn, will affect the amount that you can sell. These and related questions are the province of the large subject usually called ‘management accounting’, which does indeed mostly concern the future. Three topics implied by the above questions are budgeting, costing and pricing, and are covered in <a href="23_FinanceforIT_chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-12">CASH FLOW FORECASTING</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As stated above, whether a business is in its start-up phase, as illustrated in Example 1.1, or established as a going concern, it is vital that it continually plan its cash requirements and arrange in advance for overdraft facilities to be available when needed. This means forecasting as accurately as possible how much cash will be coming in and when; how much will need to be spent and when, and, as a result, when there will be surpluses (to be invested) or shortfalls (to be covered by borrowing). A simple example of a cash flow forecast is shown in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml#img23">Table 1.12</a>.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img23" src="images/img23.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1454" height="761"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Imagine, for example, that this table represents the cash flow forecast of a toy retailer in the six months before a major festival, at which it is the custom to give toys as presents to children. The table shows that the retailer expects its cash outflows to increase in the months preceding the festival as they stock up in anticipation of increased sales. Their expected cash inflows increase considerably during the last two months or so preceding the festival. During Months 2 to 4 they anticipate a cash shortfall, which is expected to reach a maximum in Month 4. This would need to be covered by an overdraft facility. Apart from its usefulness to management, this cash forecast is exactly the kind of document likely to be required by a bank when being asked for an overdraft facility or a loan.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch01-13">NON-BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As stated earlier, there is an accelerating trend towards international standardisation of the rules for accounting and reporting business activities. While periods of transition are not comfortable places, it will in the end be much easier to compare the financial results of companies in different countries.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For some years now there has been another, rather similar, trend: bringing closer together the accounting rules for business and non-business organisations, such as government (central and local), academic institutions, hospitals, charities, clubs and associations. This convergence has reflected growing acceptance that all organisations should be run in a business-like way, whether they are in fact businesses or not. There are of course some differences of detail and terminology between business and non-business organisations. For example, ‘surplus’ and ‘deficit’ are more appropriate terms for a charity than ‘profit’ and ‘loss’, but they mean essentially the same: the difference between income and expenses. The financial principles explained in this book are equally applicable to business and non-business organisations.</p>
<div class="box" id="ch01-14">
<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="boxText1">The main points covered in this chapter, linked to its objectives, have been the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">The main purpose of a business is to increase the wealth of its owners: in a company, the shareholders. Without ‘limited liability’, modern business would be impossible, because all the personal assets of the owners would be at risk.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">The three main sources of company finance are shareholders, lenders and profit retained in the business.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">A statement of financial position (balance sheet) is a snapshot of the assets and liabilities of a business at a moment in time. It balances because every transaction has two sides, and both sides are always recorded. All business transactions affect the financial position.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">An income statement (profit and loss account) is a summary of all the transactions that have affected profit since the last statement of financial position or, as in our example, the start of the business.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">A statement of cash flows (cash flow statement) is a summary of all the transactions that have affected cash since the last statement of financial position or the start of the business.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">In all but ‘cash only’ businesses, profit will always be different from cash flow. Some reasons are: timing differences between sales and getting paid, and between incurring expenses and paying for them; and depreciation, an accounting adjustment that affects profit but not cash flow.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">It is vital for any organisation to forecast and monitor its cash flows.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">In recent years there have been trends towards international standardisation and towards convergence of the accounting and reporting rules for business and non-business organisations.</span></li>
