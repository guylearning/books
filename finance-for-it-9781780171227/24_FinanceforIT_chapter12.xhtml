<p class="chapterTitle">12 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS: THE BASICS</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch12-1">OBJECTIVES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="italic">When you have studied this chapter you should be able to:</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="italic">explain the limitations on the amount of useful information about a business or other organisation that can be conveyed by a single set of accounts in isolation;</span></li>
<li><span class="italic">describe some of the most commonly used financial ratios;</span></li>

</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch12-2">FINANCIAL ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> I suggested that statements of financial position and income statements are static and, by themselves, tell us little about the dynamics of a business. In this chapter we shall see how financial ratios can bring accounts to life and reveal some of the dynamics of a business. As in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, I have adopted a minimalist approach in note form.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">One important caution is necessary before we start. Accounts can be misleading, ratios can be misleading. Even trends, at least short-term trends, can be misleading. It is necessary always to think of as many reasons as possible why a particular number, a particular ratio or a particular trend might be as it is.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For example, it costs money to hold inventory. Therefore, it is usually the case that the smaller the amount of inventory for a given quantity of production or sales, the better. However, the accounting year-end of a seasonal business, such as a toy manufacturer, might happen to coincide with its slack period. This might be precisely the time at which the business has to stock up, ready for its busy period. In this case, high inventory might be evidence of prudent preparation for peak business, not as evidence of poor inventory control.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Ratios in everyday life</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Ratios are simply relationships between numbers. We use them in everyday life and have come to recognise those that are useful for our purposes. Speed is one. Gradient is another (height gained or lost relative to horizontal distance) and it can be expressed in different ways. A steep hill can be described as ‘one in four’ or ‘1:4’ or ‘25%’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Business people also recognise that the relationships between some numbers in statements of financial position and income statements are useful. In various contexts, listed below, they can reveal how the business is doing. For example, ‘gross margin’ is the relationship of gross profit to revenue. It too can be expressed in different ways. If revenue is 100, and gross profit is 25, then gross margin could be expressed as ‘1:4’ or ‘25%’ or ‘0.25’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">There is no universal agreement on which financial ratios are useful. Neither is there any universal agreement on the names or even the components of some of them. For example, one person’s ‘gearing ratio’ might be another’s ‘borrowing ratio’. In this chapter I have included a selection of the ratios that would probably appear on most people’s ‘useful’ list. I have also tried to follow what I believe to be the majority taste in terms of their names and components.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Whenever you see a financial ratio being referred to, find out what numbers comprise it and, if one ratio is being compared with another, for example this year against last year, make sure that like is being compared with like.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Contexts</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As with, for example, crime figures and interest rates, so a single ratio is virtually meaningless. Ratios only come to life in a context, where they can provide comparisons or reveal trends. For example, two companies in the same industry might both show a gross margin this year of 30 per cent. However, for one company this might be part of a declining trend; for the other, part of an improving trend. The ratio itself would tell a potential investor very little about either company; the trend would provide valuable information. Useful contexts include the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>previous years;</li>
<li>earlier forecasts;</li>
<li>industry averages;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">competitors.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Even in context, the need to use judgement in interpreting ratios is worth reiterating.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Interested parties</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Who is interested in business results and ratios? They may be:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>shareholders, actual or potential;</li>
<li>lenders, actual or potential;</li>
<li>managers and employees;</li>
<li>suppliers and customers;</li>
<li>salespeople (concerning a customer or prospect);</li>
<li class="bullet-last">auditors, tax authorities, financial analysts and stockbrokers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Categories of ratio</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">It is sometimes convenient to group commonly used ratios together into categories. As with the ratios themselves there is no rule and some ratios really belong in more than one category. Categories often used, and that we shall use, are as follows:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>profitability;</li>
<li>activity, also sometimes called ‘capital productivity’;</li>
<li>liquidity;</li>
<li>gearing;</li>
<li>stock market;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">others.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">We shall work through these categories in the sequence given above.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Some people suggest rule-of-thumb ‘right’ values for some ratios. However, these can be misleading and, in any case, can vary greatly from industry to industry. With one exception, they are not given here.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch12-3">EXAMPLE 12.1: A SAMPLE COMPANY</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As with the business transactions that we considered in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, it will be helpful to use a contrived example for the financial ratios that we are considering in this one. There are two particular advantages to be had from adopting this approach. First, we can choose to concentrate on the core items of any statement of financial position and income statement, thus avoiding unnecessary complications and allowing us to see more clearly the principles involved. A second advantage is that we can choose numbers that are easy to work with. The business whose fortunes we followed in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> has so far, you may recall, only existed for one year. In considering ratios it would be more helpful to use a well-established business as an example. The accounts of such a business are set out in <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img211">Table 12.1</a>. They are in the now familiar format and have numbers that are easy to work with.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Notice that in <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img211">Table 12.1</a> I have shown ‘dividend’ as a deduction from profit for the year. This is for the sake of simplicity and completeness for our present purpose. You will recall from <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> that in practice dividends are shown in the statement of changes in equity. It follows that ‘profit after dividend’ is a non-standard term coined just for this example.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">The only item that we have not already considered is the one at the bottom of the income statement called ‘earnings per share’. This is simply the profit after tax divided by the number of shares in circulation. Suppose that the company has issued 20 million shares of CU1 each (rather than, say, 40 million shares of 50 cents each). Profit after tax is the amount by which trading has caused equity to increase during the year. It varies from year to year. In most companies, the number of shares in circulation will also vary from year to year. This ratio provides a common measure: the amount of profit after tax attributable to each share.</span></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img211" src="images/img211.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1062" height="1500"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img212" src="images/img212.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1450" height="838"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a> shows, as an addendum to the accounts, all the ratios that we shall be considering in the remainder of this chapter, cross-referenced to the items that comprise them. The two last items, dividend per share and assumed share price, do not form part of a published income statement. They are memorandum items used in working out some of the financial ratios. You may wish to refer to <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a> throughout this chapter. In what follows, each paragraph about a particular ratio consists of the following parts:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>the name of the ratio;</li>
<li>its usual components;</li>
<li>its meaning (the information conveyed by it);</li>
<li>the relevant extract from <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a> (this year’s result, followed by last year’s in brackets);</li>
<li class="bullet-last">brief comments.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Two years’ results could hardly be called a trend. However, in referring to the ratios in <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a> I shall use the word as a convenient shorthand when commenting on the results. Where I suggest that further analysis would need to be done, I am usually referring to analysis that could only be done by people within the company, using the detailed information to which only they would have access.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img213" src="images/img213.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1027" height="1500"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img214" src="images/img214.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1300" height="1253"/></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch12-4">PROFITABILITY RATIOS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These represent different ways of showing how profitable a business is, by which I mean how much profit it has made relative either to revenue or to the financial resources used in the business. The ratios in this category that we shall consider are:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>gross margin;</li>
<li>operating margin;</li>
<li>return on capital employed;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">return on equity.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Gross margin</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Gross profit: revenue</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: Shows what percentage of revenue is left after all the costs of getting a product or service to a saleable state have been deducted. The higher the better.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 20% (22.4%)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Trend bad. Further analysis would be needed to show to what extent this is due to lower sales volumes, lower selling prices or higher cost of sales. Comparisons with competitors and industry averages would provide further insights, a comment that is applicable to all the ratios that we shall discuss.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Operating margin</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Operating profit: revenue</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: Shows what percentage of revenue is left after deducting all the costs including the expenses of selling and delivering to the customer, and administering the business, but excluding the ‘financial costs’ (interest, tax and dividend). The higher the better.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 8.3% (10.3%)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Trend bad. Because operating profit is arrived at before deducting the ‘financial’ charges (interest, tax and dividends) this ratio is useful for comparison with other companies, whose businesses may be similar, but which may be financed in different ways. This is one of the two ratios often called ‘secondary ratios’. The other is ‘capital productivity’ (see below).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Return on capital employed (ROCE)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Operating profit: capital employed (usually equity plus long-term debt)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: Shows the percentage ‘return’ made from using the long-term money employed in the business. It allows comparison with other possible uses of that money. The higher the better.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 12.5% (14.6%)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">Trend bad. Sometimes called the ‘primary ratio’, this ratio is closely related to two other ratios (operating margin and capital productivity), which are sometimes therefore called the ‘secondary ratios’. The precise relationship we shall consider shortly.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Would it not be more accurate to use as the figure for capital employed the average during the year rather than, as I have done, the capital employed at the end of the year? The answer is ‘yes, it would’. However, in practice many people do not do so. This is for two reasons:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>It is quicker and simpler to use all numbers from a single year.</li>
<li>Trends and comparisons are what ratios should be used for. Revealed trends are likely to be much the same whichever method is used, provided it is used consistently.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Similar remarks apply to other statement of financial position numbers used in the following examples.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Return on equity (ROE)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Profit after tax: equity</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: Shows the profit that belongs to the shareholders, as a percentage of the funds that belong to them. The higher the better.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 12% (17.4%)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Trend bad. Remember that equity includes both share capital and the profit that has been retained in the business. The reason why this ratio has shown such a sharp decline is that the profit after tax is smaller but the equity has increased.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch12-5"><span class="no-style-override">ACTIVITY (OR CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY) RATIOS</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These ratios relate revenue to all or some of the assets being used or ‘turned over’ in generating revenue; or (the other side of the same coin) how productively the capital invested in those assets is being used, hence the alternative name.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Capital productivity or asset turnover</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This is one of the two ratios often called the ‘secondary ratios’. The other is ‘operating margin’. See below for an explanation of the connection between these ratios and the so-called ‘primary ratio’: the return on capital employed.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Revenue: net assets (total assets less current liabilities) or capital employed (equity plus long-term debt)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: <span class="no-style-override-7">Shows the relationship between revenue and the total resources used to generate it. The higher the better. The ‘total resources’ can be thought of as either the net assets (total assets less current liabilities) being used or the long-term capital employed in financing them. The number, CU40 million in this case, is of course the same.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 1.5 (1.4)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">Trend good. The additional insight gained from this ratio is that we appear to be getting more effective at using our assets to generate revenue, but (from the profitability ratios) less effective at generating profit from those sales. The principle, used in this ratio to relate total net assets to revenue, can also be applied to particular classes of asset: non-current assets, for example, or inventory and receivables (see below).</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Inventory turnover</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Revenue: inventory</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: Shows how rapidly the business is using or ‘turning over’ its inventory. The ratio can be applied to inventory as a whole or to its components (raw materials, work in progress and finished goods). The higher the turnover the better. The following example illustrates a use of this ratio.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 4.0 (3.2)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Trend good. The more rapid the inventory turnover for a given amount of revenue, the lower the average level of inventory held. Most inventory is expensive to hold. Depending upon the kind of inventory, holding costs include interest on the money invested in it, and storage costs (people and space, insurance, deterioration and pilferage). The less inventory a business can operate with, the lower the holding costs.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="bold">Illustration – </span>The inventory turnover this year is 60 / 15 = 4, which means that for CU60 million of revenue CU15 million of inventory is carried. Suppose the industry average to be an inventory turnover of 5. If we could equal this average it would mean that, for the same level of revenue, we would only be carrying CU12 million (60 / 5) of inventory, a reduction of CU3 million. Supposing our inventory holding costs to be, say, 20 per cent of inventory value, not at all unusual, then the annual saving in holding costs would be 20 per cent of CU3 million = CU600k. If you were a manager pressing for a more efficient inventory control system or a salesperson proposing such a system, would this not be useful information with which to help make your case?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Applications that result in a reduction of inventory-holding are typical IT applications. This is an example of how simple financial analysis could be used to obtain a broad initial idea of the likely benefit to a business of a proposed major application.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Receivable days</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Receivables means money earning interest in customers’ bank accounts rather than in ours. The sooner customers pay their bills, the better. This ratio shows how long, on average, they are taking.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Receivables: average daily revenue</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: Shows how effective the business is on average at getting its customers to pay their bills. Allows comparison with the company’s terms of trade. Obviously, the figure for credit revenue only should be used if known. The fewer days, the better.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 61 days (57 days) (Trend bad)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="bold">Illustration – </span>Our debts are currently outstanding on average for 61 days. Suppose our terms of trade require payment in 30 days. If these terms were to be adhered to there would on average be only approximately half the amount of debts, CU5 million, outstanding. If our cost of money is 10 per cent, then the annual saving from such a reduction, in terms of finance costs, would be 10% × CU5 million = CU500k. The numbers used are, of course, for illustration only. Such a large reduction in receivable days would be regarded by most businesses as optimistic.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The converse of receivable days is ‘payable days’. This is worked out in a similar way, but is usually the ratio of trade payables to daily revenue. The answer is an approximation to the number of days that a company is, on average, taking to pay its payables. A company should usually take advantage of any discounts offered for early payment, otherwise pay on the due date. Ideally the comparison should be not with revenue but with credit purchases. However, the latter figure is not usually determinable directly from published accounts, although it may be possible to derive an approximation to it.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">More on the ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ ratios</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Having now covered the so-called primary and secondary ratios, a digression will be worthwhile in order to examine the relationship between them. Summarising what we know of them:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Operating margin is operating profit over revenue.</li>
<li>Capital productivity is revenue over capital employed (or net assets).</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Return on capital employed (ROCE) is operating profit over capital employed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Expressing these relationships algebraically we can obtain the following expression:</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img218" src="images/img218.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1055" height="90"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Giving each term its usual name, we obtain the following:</p>
<p class="paraCenter1"><span class="no-style-override-7">operating margin × capital productivity = ROCE</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">We can now see why operating margin and capital productivity are sometimes called the ‘secondary ratios’. It is because they are the components of the primary ratio (ROCE). For our company the relevant numbers are:</p>
<p class="paraCenter1"><span class="no-style-override-7">8.33% × 1.5 = 12.5%.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img219-1">Figure 12.1</a> represents this relationship diagrammatically. What happens on the left-hand side of the diagram concerns the income statement. What happens on the right-hand side concerns the statement of financial position. Note how ‘revenue’ represents the link between them. <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img219-2">Figure 12.2</a> simply shows the relevant numbers from our company superimposed on the diagram.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2"><span class="no-style-override-3">Using the primary and secondary ratios</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">So what? As an example, suppose that our major competitor, of similar size and with a similar revenue figure, consistently delivers a return on capital employed of 15 per cent, compared with our 12.5 per cent. The competitor would appear to be ‘doing better’ than us. The ROCE by itself says nothing about how they are achieving this, but its two components do.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Suppose that the competitor’s capital productivity or asset revenue is much the same as ours, at 1.5. In that case, their profit margin must be higher, and we would look to a more detailed comparison of the respective income statements to discover why.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Suppose, on the other hand, that the competitor’s profit margin is much the same as ours, namely 8.3 per cent. In that case their capital productivity must be greater, and we would look to a more detailed comparison of the respective statements of financial position to discover why. Depending on the kind of business, this more detailed analysis would usually include consideration, among other things, of two particular assets, inventory and receivables, which we have already done.</p>

<div class="box">
<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText2">So far in this chapter we have covered the first and third objectives, and have done some work toward the achievement of the second. In particular:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have discussed why a single set of business accounts in isolation conveys little information about how the business is actually performing;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have worked through examples of some commonly used ratios concerning profitability and activity;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have considered the various contexts in which ratios have meaning.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch12-6"><span class="no-style-override">LIQUIDITY (OR CASH MANAGEMENT) RATIOS</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Liquidity means the extent to which a business has cash and other assets that could readily be turned into cash. Liquidity is primarily about whether a business can fulfil its obligations as they fall due. The analysis is usually done with two ratios, the first being rather a broad one.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Current ratio</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Current assets: current liabilities</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: Shows to what extent current assets are adequate to meet current liabilities or, putting it another way, the extent to which current assets are financed by current liabilities.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 1.9 (2.1)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Current assets, collectively, are the only fund out of which current liabilities could be paid. If non-current assets had to be sold to pay the bills, then the business would be in trouble. However, the key word above is ‘adequate’ and this only has meaning in the context of a particular industry. The components, and relative proportions, of current assets and current liabilities vary greatly from industry to industry. The main use of this ratio is to prompt investigation of any significant trends either way, and as a comparison with other companies and with industry averages.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Quick or ‘acid test’ ratio</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: (Current assets less inventory): current liabilities</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: Gives an indication of the business’s ability to pay its bills as they fall due.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 0.9 (0.9)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Similar to the current ratio except that, by excluding inventory, it removes the one current asset that is not usually convertible into cash other than through the usual processes of the business. The others are mainly either cash or receivables. Receivables can be turned into cash immediately by ‘factoring’ or ‘invoice discounting’ (selling receivables to a specialist company for an immediate discounted cash lump sum). A quick ratio of approximately 1 (as in this example) is sometimes regarded as a satisfactory indication of liquidity.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch12-7">GEARING OR LEVERAGE RATIOS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These ratios concern the relationship between shareholders’ money and borrowed money. For us as individuals, borrowing can be a good thing, but only up to a point because the higher the borrowing, the more the finance costs. The same is true of businesses and other organisations. The higher the proportion of borrowed money, the higher ‘geared’ the company is said to be.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Gearing (or debt/equity) ratio</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Borrowings (interest-bearing debt): equity</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: Provides a measure of the amount of debt relative to the amount of equity.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 60.0 (78.3)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Borrowing usually means all interest-bearing debt, including overdrafts if applicable. On a bicycle, changing to a higher gear means that you travel further for each turn of the pedals, but only up to a point. If the gearing is too high for the conditions, then you come to a stop. The higher the gearing or leverage in a business, the more it can do (because it has more money) without diluting the control of the existing shareholders, but only up to a point. If the gearing becomes too high, then the business may come to a stop because the interest burden is too great. We can see, from the statement of financial position that the main reason for the fall in this ratio from last year to this is that CU3 million of the loan has been repaid.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Interest cover</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Operating profit: finance costs</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: Is the business making enough profit to cover the interest on its borrowings?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 5 (6)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Compares the amount of profit before interest with the finance costs. The higher the better. However, the interest cover that might satisfy a potential lender would vary from industry to industry, and from company to company. The more volatile or speculative the industry, the higher the cover would need to be.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Summary of ratios considered so far</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a> summarises the ratios that we have considered so far, cross-referenced to the statement of financial position and income statement from which they were derived. The list is representative rather than exhaustive, but the ratios it contains are among the most commonly used. It should serve to give an idea of what financial analysis is about.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch12-8">STOCK MARKET RATIOS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">All the ratios discussed so far are derived solely from numbers in a company’s statement of financial position and income statement. However, there is an external factor that is of considerable significance to companies whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange, and to their shareholders. This is the price at which the company’s shares are traded: the ‘share price’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The better a company’s prospects are deemed to be, the greater will be the demand for its shares, and therefore the higher will be the share price. But prospects of what? The answer is ‘future earnings or profits’. Again referring to our company, examples of two commonly used stock market ratios are as follows:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Dividend yield</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">From its accounts, it is apparent that our company has declared a dividend of CU1 million. This represents five cents per share.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Latest dividend: current share price</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: This is the latest dividend per share compared with the current share price, expressed (usually) as a percentage.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 2.5% (1.7%)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Whether a dividend yield is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ depends on several things. For example, an investor seeking primarily dividend income might regard a high yield as good. However, if the high yield has been achieved by retaining insufficient profit in the business for expansion, then in the longer term it may prove to be bad, because additional borrowings may be necessary, the interest on which will deplete profit in later years.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Price/earnings (P/E)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Suppose that the market price of our shares stands at CU2 (or 200 cents) per share.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Ratio: Current share price: latest earnings per share (EPS)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Meaning: A measure of how optimistic or otherwise the market is about the future prospects of a company. The higher the P/E ratio, the more optimistic the market.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img213">Table 12.2</a>: 13.3 (15.0)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The price at which shares change hands is governed by supply and demand. If the market thinks that a company is going to produce better than average profits in future, then demand for its shares will increase and the price will go up; and vice versa. The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the market’s regard for a share. The P/E ratio is also useful because it takes into account, via the earnings per share, all of the profit that belongs to the shareholders, not just that part of it that is paid to them as dividend.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch12-9">OTHER RATIOS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Probably the most important other class of ratio almost universally used is the one that concerns those important assets that do not usually appear on company statements of financial position: people. Among the most widely used are revenue per employee and operating profit per employee, but many others are possible. Other ratios are specific to particular industries. For example, supermarkets measure revenue per square foot or square metre; airlines and other transport undertakings measure revenue per passenger/kilometre and (for freight) revenue per ton/kilometre.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch12-10">SHAREHOLDER VALUE ADDED</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Shareholder value added, sometimes shortened to SVA, is an old idea rediscovered, developed and packaged. The purpose of a business is to create wealth, or ‘add value’, for the proprietor or proprietors (in a company, the shareholders).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Shareholders require as a minimum from their investment a return at least as great as that obtainable from investments generally with an equivalent level of perceived risk. They would actually like a greater return: the higher the better. However, if they do not earn at least this minimum return, then they have no motivation to keep their money invested. They will take it out and put it elsewhere. Any return in excess of that minimum is ‘value added’ to the shareholders.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The cost of equity</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This minimum return is usually called, rather confusingly, a company’s ‘cost of equity’. Dividends are optional. Some companies never pay a dividend; some refrain from doing so in hard times. Shareholders gain their ‘return’ from a combination of dividends and capital growth (increase in share price). Both of these depend, in different ways, on profit. Dividends can only be paid out of profit, while capital growth will only happen if the market believes that the company will in the medium-term do better in profit terms than the expectation for companies in that industry generally.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">So, in its simplest form, the question is: ‘of the profit after tax (the profit that belongs to the shareholders) how much, if any, is left after deducting the minimum return required by the shareholders (the “cost of equity”)?’ <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img224">Table 12.3</a> shows an example that illustrates the point.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml#img224">Table 12.3</a> I have used as the equity number the equity at the beginning of the year. I have stated earlier in this chapter that most people use end-of-year numbers for other ratios, so why the apparent inconsistency here? The reason is that the SVA calculation is analogous to the investor putting money into a bank or building society and seeing if the interest earned after a year is greater than the ‘going rate’ for investments of that kind. In order for the argument to make sense, the investment obviously has to have been in place for a year. So, the equity on which the return is worked out should be the equity at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img224" src="images/img224.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="848"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">What does the answer mean?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In this particular year, the company has added CU0.7 million of value to its shareholders. This is the amount by which the profit after tax has exceeded their minimum expectation from their investment. Had the final number been negative it would mean that value had been taken away from the shareholders. Notice that the amount of dividend actually paid is ignored in the calculation. This is because all the profit after tax belongs to the shareholders, whether it is paid to them as dividend or not.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">I have glossed over the question of how the ‘cost of equity’ is actually worked out. It is not a particularly complicated calculation, but the arguments needed to justify it are lengthy and unnecessary for our purpose. If your company is into shareholder value added, then you will no doubt be able to find out (a) the particular way in which they apply it, and (b) what percentage cost of equity is currently assumed.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The implications of shareholder value added</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">What are the implications of shareholder value added? If the ultimate aim of a company is to add value to its shareholders, then it follows that every division and department of the company should, if possible, achieve the same end. This is why, in some companies, a way of managing based on SVA, sometimes also called ‘value-based management’, is used:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>as a yardstick by which divisions and departments are measured;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">as a basis for incentives for managers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The principle of SVA may also be used as a method of evaluating investment opportunities such as IT proposals. Ways of doing so are explored in <a href="18_FinanceforIT_chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">This has been a brief outline of shareholder value added as applied to a company as a whole. It has proponents among finance professionals, and applications of the SVA idea are generally well accepted. Some people have taken the basic idea and made it considerably more sophisticated.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">One organisation that did this is Stern Stewart, the New York consultancy firm. They have developed a large number of suggested adjustments to normal accounting numbers in order that accountants might do a better job of showing the economic reality of companies. They trademarked their particular approach under the name Economic Value Added (EVA<sup>®</sup>). One purpose of the various attempts at sophistication is to explore the use of the SVA idea as a vehicle for correcting some of the perceived shortcomings of conventional accounting methods and to assist in the process of reconciling the differences in methods between countries.</p>

<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="boxText2">The main points covered in this chapter, linked to its objectives, have been the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>A statement of financial position is a snapshot. An income statement only covers a single period. To determine the progress of a business it is necessary to look at relationships between key numbers in a set of accounts, and at trends and comparisons.</li>
<li>The following are the ratios covered in this chapter as commonly categorised:
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Profitability – gross margin, operating margin, return on capital employed, return on equity.</li>
<li>Activity – capital productivity, inventory turnover, receivable days.</li>
<li>Liquidity – current ratio, quick ratio.</li>
<li>Gearing – debt/equity, interest cover.</li>
<li>Stock market – earnings per share, dividend yield, price/earnings.</li>
</ul>
</div></li>
<li>The following contexts usually give meaning to ratios: past years, previous forecasts, industry averages, competitors.</li>
<li>Shareholder value added is the amount, if any, left after deducting from profit after tax the cost of the capital used to earn it.</li>
