<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch08-2">DEPRECIATION OF IT ASSETS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Take any dozen organisations and you will find as many different approaches to the depreciation of IT assets. Some methods cause an artificially high or low charge to the income statement and to budgets in the year of acquisition. Some approaches to the depreciation of upgrades have the effect of causing depreciation ‘peaks’, either in the middle or at the end of life of the upgradable range.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Depreciation is an accounting technique for charging the cost of a non-current asset as an expense to the income statements of the years that benefit from its use. The expense reduces the profit, and the book value of the asset on the statement of financial position is correspondingly reduced. When the asset is eventually sold, the proceeds of sale are deducted from its book value. Any remaining amount is charged to the income statement as ‘loss on disposal’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The term ‘depreciation’ is usually restricted to the decline in value of tangible assets, such as IT hardware. ‘Amortisation’ is usually used to describe the decline in value of intangible assets. This is especially true of leaseholds, but it is also applied to IT assets such as licences to use software.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Depreciation is governed by accounting standards. The current international standard is International Accounting Standard 16 (IAS 16) – Property, plant and equipment. The gist of the rules is that the cost of an asset, less its expected residual value, should be depreciated over its expected useful life. The standards do not require any particular method of depreciation to be adopted. This, and the estimated life of the asset, are left to be determined by the business person. There are a number of possible depreciation methods, the most important of which are described below.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch08-3">STRAIGHT-LINE DEPRECIATION</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As its name implies, this method charges the cost of the asset, less any expected proceeds of sale, in equal amounts over the asset’s expected useful life. It is easy to use and reflects the fact that the usefulness of most assets is much the same for each year of their useful lives. Its main disadvantage arises from the fact that it does not usually reflect the true decline in market value of an asset over its life. We know that the most expensive journey made by a new car is the drive from the showroom. The market value curve of most IT hardware assets behaves in much the same way.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Although the book value of assets does not have slavishly to reflect their market value, any significant difference between the two leads to a ‘loss on disposal’ when the asset is disposed of (see below). The straight-line method, combined with a frequent tendency to overestimate asset life, makes this a common problem. However, despite its drawbacks, many organisations use straight-line depreciation.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch08-4">REDUCING BALANCE DEPRECIATION</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Using this approach, a fixed percentage rate of decline, for example 40 per cent, is charged as depreciation each year. This method reflects more closely the decline in market value of most assets and is also easy enough to use. Its main problem is the fact that it results in a higher charge in the first year than the straight-line method. A higher charge to the income statement means less profit, and a higher charge against a departmental budget means less money for other things. However, the higher the depreciation charge early in an asset’s life, the less likely is a substantial loss on eventual disposal.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch08-5">LOSS ON DISPOSAL</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">When an asset is disposed of (for example, when it is traded in for a replacement), any remaining book value, less any trade-in value, is charged to the income statement, and often to a departmental budget, as an expense. This is a common reason for delaying the replacement of old IT technology with new.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Avoiding the problem</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">A longer-term solution is to take a more realistic view of the useful life of the assets concerned and depreciate accordingly, or to use an alternative method of depreciation.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">A way to avoid the immediate problem, where the option is available, is to upgrade the asset rather than replace it. The advantage of this is that with an upgrade the original asset remains <span class="italic">in situ </span>and continues to be depreciated in the usual way, so that a loss on disposal does not arise. However, if the same problem but with bigger numbers is to be avoided in the future, then the useful life of that asset, or of assets of that class, should be reassessed and the depreciation period shortened. Also, depending on the organisation’s depreciation policy for upgrades, this approach could bring its own problems (see below).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Another approach, applicable to IT hardware, is to avoid the statement of financial position altogether and use operating leases. However, if such a lease were to be terminated early, any termination charge may have a similarly undesirable effect on the income statement to ‘loss on disposal’. The shorter the lease, the less likely this would be, but then the higher would be the periodic lease payments.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Scraping the barrel</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Much IT equipment is sold at a discounted price. Where the upgrade option is not available, it has been known for some organisations to try to postpone the ‘loss on disposal’ problem by getting the supplier to invoice new equipment at a higher price, with a correspondingly higher value shown for trade-in of the old. The higher the trade-in value, the lower the immediate ‘loss on disposal’. However, without also taking a more realistic view on asset life, the problem has merely been postponed. It will reoccur, with bigger numbers, when the new asset itself comes to be replaced. Any such manipulation of values will have accounting, tax and legal implications for the customer, the supplier and any finance company involved. The safest course is not to do it, but if it is contemplated, then professional advice should be sought. This subject is also covered in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> in the context of outsourcing.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">An even more desperate approach, sometimes adopted, is to install the new asset, while keeping the old one and simply switching it off, continuing to depreciate it in the normal way until it is fully ‘written off’, when it is then disposed of. Running costs of the old asset are saved and a loss on disposal is avoided. However, possibly substantial proceeds of sale are forgone and depreciation will have to be charged on the new asset as well as the old. Given that budgets are not legal requirements but matters of administrative convenience, it is surprising the contortions that are sometimes gone through in order to stay within such self-imposed rules.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">These attempts to postpone reality are simply that. The cost of an asset, less any eventual proceeds of sale, will always eventually hit the income statement as an expense and, if applicable, be charged against a budget in one way or another. This will either be as depreciation during the asset’s life or as loss on disposal at the end of it.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch08-6">FREQUENCY OF DEPRECIATION CHARGE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, that is in the required location and condition. Many organisations charge depreciation monthly from that date. Some, however, adopt the practice of charging a full year’s depreciation in the accounting year of availability, regardless of when in that year availability occurs. This may be acceptable for assets having a long life of, say, 20 years or more, but many of today’s IT assets have a very short life in some organisations.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">It is true that where large numbers of assets are acquired on a regular basis the effect averages out. It may also, in an arbitrary way, sometimes help to alleviate the loss on disposal problem. However, with major assets, charging depreciation monthly reflects more accurately the contribution made to revenue-earning by the asset during its useful life.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch08-7">DEPRECIATION OF UPGRADABLE ASSETS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Upgradability is a particular feature of some IT assets. In general, organisations use one of three methods, described and illustrated below (see <a href="20_FinanceforIT_chapter08.xhtml#img125">Figure 8.1</a>). The first two can cause serious distortion to the accounts and to budgets if the amounts are significant, and are not recommended. The third is to be preferred. The methods are as follows.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img125" src="images/img125.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="944"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Method 1: Treat each upgrade as though it were a separate new asset</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In this example, the base asset is assumed to have a three-year life, so is depreciated over three years. Each upgrade is assumed to have a two-year life, so is depreciated over two years from when it was acquired. A glance at <a href="20_FinanceforIT_chapter08.xhtml#img125">Figure 8.1</a> shows how this approach can cause a ‘depreciation peak’ in the mid-life of the asset, quite unrelated to its contribution to earning revenue.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Method 2: Depreciate to the expected end of life of the range</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">When organisations that adopt this approach buy a base asset that they know to be upgradable they take as its ‘expected useful life’ the estimated life of the range as a whole, including upgrades. For example, suppose this to be five years. It follows, so the theory goes, that subsequently acquired upgrades must have the same expected end of life. Consequently the periods over which successive upgrades can be depreciated are progressively shorter and the per annum depreciation of the upgraded asset becomes higher and higher. <a href="20_FinanceforIT_chapter08.xhtml#img125">Figure 8.1</a> shows that this approach also results in a depreciation peak, this time at the end of life rather than in the middle. The approach demands the almost impossible task of estimating the end of life of a range of equipment. However, an obvious attraction of it is the low charge for depreciation in the early years.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Method 3: Reassess remaining useful life after each upgrade</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This method reflects the fact that the effect of an upgrade is to prolong the useful life of the base asset. It requires that on acquiring a base asset, the expected useful life of that asset be assessed, ignoring possible upgrades. On acquiring each upgrade a fresh assessment should be made of the remaining useful life and the remaining book value depreciated over that period. As <a href="20_FinanceforIT_chapter08.xhtml#img125">Figure 8.1</a> shows, this method avoids depreciation peaks and comes closest to representing what has actually happened. It also allows for an indefinite number of upgrades, an increasingly common phenomenon with IT hardware and software.</p>

<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="boxText2">The main points covered in this chapter, linked to its objectives, have been the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Depreciation is an accounting method for spreading the cost of non-current assets over their expected useful lives. Characteristics of most IT assets (short and unpredictable lives, uncertain residual values, and upgradability) all represent challenges to customary depreciation methods.</li>
<li>‘Loss on disposal’ is the difference between the book value and market value of an asset. Its cause is inadequate depreciation during the asset’s life. By being charged as an expense, its effect is to reduce profit. Short-term, it can be avoided by upgrading rather than exchanging. Ultimately, it can only be avoided by depreciating over realistic periods, by using more ‘front-loaded’ methods or by writing operating leases.</li>
<li>The recommended way to depreciate upgradable assets is to reassess useful life at the time of each upgrade and to reschedule the remaining book value over that remaining life.</li>
