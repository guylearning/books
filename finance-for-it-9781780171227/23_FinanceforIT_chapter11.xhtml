</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The purpose of this chapter is to provide an introduction to three other aspects of finance that are relevant to IT decision makers and that collectively could be said to form the backbone of the very large subject called management accounting: budgeting, costing and pricing. Each of these could be the subject of whole books and indeed many books have already been written about them.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-2">BUDGETING</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">No laws govern budgeting or oblige companies to budget. However, most companies and other organisations operate budgeting procedures and most IT departments have to operate within budget constraints.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> of this book covers the fundamental principles of finance and accounting for those who start from zero knowledge or wish to brush up on knowledge that they already have. It notes how all business transactions can be recorded in that primary accounting document called the statement of financial position. It looks at the role of the income statement as an explanation of how the profit or loss made since the start of the business, or since the previous statement of financial position, was arrived at; and the similar role played by the statement of cash flows, but with respect to cash. <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> covers some basic financial analysis, and shows how various comparisons – of numbers within the accounts, and with past years, industry averages, competitors and so on – can provide information about how a business has been performing.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">However, characteristic of all that information is that it concerns the past. We as individuals may find it useful, even if possibly depressing, to find out from our personal ‘accounts’ that our expenditure exceeded our income last year, and what caused the excess. However, would it not have been even more useful if we had had some idea in advance that that was likely to be the case? If so, then we might have had a chance to do something about it. The same is true of businesses and other organisations. Sometimes individuals do try to work out their personal finances in advance, however approximately. The process of doing so is called budgeting and the same word is used to describe the very similar activity carried out by almost all organisations. A budget is a financial plan setting targets for the revenues and expenditures of an organisation for a specified period.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">For a small business, the budgeting process may be as simple as it would be for most individuals, consisting of estimates of income and expenses, and the resulting profit or loss, and of cash availability month by month, highlighting periods during which overdraft facilities might be needed. The business would also need to budget for any planned capital expenditure, such as new premises or equipment, just as an individual would if buying a house or a car. This is for two reasons. The first is to determine whether the necessary financial resources are already available or can be borrowed. The second is that capital expenditure always has an effect on subsequent year-by-year revenue expenditure. If existing resources such as cash deposits or investments are to be used, then there will in future be less income from interest or dividends; if a loan is to be taken out, then there will be higher expense in the form of interest, and increased cash outflow on both the interest and the repayments. Either way, if the asset to be acquired is one that will depreciate in value, then this will be an expense that will further reduce profit. Profit will also be reduced, and cash outflow increased, by the running costs of the asset.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-3">DEPARTMENTALISED BUSINESSES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As a business gets bigger, there comes a point at which the owner or owners, or, in the case of a company, the board of directors, can no longer take all the decisions themselves. They have no choice but to divide the business up into manageable parts and to appoint a director or manager to be in charge of each part. The three most common ways of carving a business up are by function, by product or by region, or possibly all three. Division by function distinguishes between the major functions of a business. What these are will depend upon the kind of business it is, but they might typically include research and development, manufacturing, sales, distribution and finance. They might also include IT, although in some businesses the person in charge of IT reports to another functional head, typically but not necessarily the head of finance. Division by product distinguishes between the major products of a business. For example, a large IT manufacturer might have separate divisions for its main hardware and software products and its services. Division by geography may be by continent, country or region within a country.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">As you can imagine, a worldwide multi-product company that carries out most of its functions in most or all of the countries in which it operates, will have a quite complex divisional or departmental structure. At the other end of the scale, the successful owner of a shop, who buys another shop and appoints a manager to run it, would have a quite simple structure: the two shops.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Mention of a manager highlights an important point, which is that however complex or simple the way of dividing up the business, if you are going to give someone responsibility for managing a part of it then you had better also provide them with the resources with which to do so, including financial resources. To do this we can expand slightly the original idea of a budget as simply an estimate of future income, expense and cash flow, to become a way of allocating financial resources to the managers of various parts of the business and delegating authority for managing those resources. Eventually the sum of the income, expense and cash flow budgets of all the divisions and departments will give the totals of those budgets for the business as a whole, although as a bargaining position, revenue budgets may be initially overstated, while expense budgets may be understated.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-4">COST CENTRES AND PROFIT CENTRES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Exactly what financial resources are delegated depends upon the nature of the division or department. For this purpose, let us dispense with the rather cumbersome ‘division or department’ and coin the term ‘centre’ to mean either. Many centres do not earn revenue for the business but simply incur costs, and so are called ‘cost centres’. An example would be an accounting department, which is necessary for the running of the business but which would be most unlikely to earn revenue. The obvious requirement for such a centre therefore is that its costs should be minimised and its budget would reflect that fact.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">If there were such a thing as a centre that earned revenue without incurring any cost, then it would no doubt be called a ‘revenue centre’. The obvious example of a centre whose purpose is to produce revenue is a sales division or department. Since, however, such a centre does indeed incur costs (salespeople’s salaries, commissions and travel, for example) then it is clearly important to budget not just for the revenue required to be earned by that particular centre but for its costs also. Since those costs eventually become expenses, and since profit is the difference between revenue and expenses, it is perhaps not surprising that such a centre would usually be called a ‘profit centre’.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-5">CHARGE-OUT</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Some functions in a business, for example the IT function, may be either cost centres or profit centres. If, as well as serving the company, IT services are provided to other businesses for a charge, then the IT function or part of it would be regarded as a profit centre; if not, then it would be regarded as a cost centre. Sometimes, even where no external services are provided, notional amounts are ‘charged out’ to user departments within the business. Charge-out may be at cost or at a marked up amount yielding a notional profit to the IT department. The purpose of such an approach is to encourage functional management to operate their function as though it were indeed an independent business. Especially is this so if the amounts charged to user departments are reasonably accurate, which is more easily said than done, and if user departments are free to use external IT services if they can be obtained more cost-effectively. Such calculations may eventually be the basis for deciding whether to outsource part or all of the IT function.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-6">RESPONSIBILITY ACCOUNTING</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">There would be little point in doing the considerable amount of work involved in budgeting if account were not kept of how individual centre managers actually perform when measured against their budgets. Budget-holding managers are indeed judged on, among other things, their performance against budget, and it is but a small further step to reward or penalise them on the basis of such performance. Many managers are paid bonuses based on their performance against budget. In this way managers responsible for divisions or departments are held accountable for the performance of those centres. Not surprisingly, the term ‘responsibility accounting’ is sometimes used to describe this whole process.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">As in the example above of the sales division, it is usually obvious which centres in a business are responsible for generating revenues. However, if managers are to be held responsible for costs, then it is important that managers are only measured against those costs over which they can have some control. Many costs are obviously directly attributable to a particular centre. For example, the rent and insurance of a factory building are obviously direct costs of the manufacturing division as a whole, which will be the responsibility of the manufacturing director. It is therefore reasonable to include those costs in the total by which that person is measured. By contrast, the manufacturing director is likely to have no control whatever over whether extra money required by the company is raised by borrowing or by issuing further shares. This kind of decision is the responsibility of the financial director or chief financial officer, who would therefore be held accountable, for example, for any extra finance costs.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-7">THE IMPORTANCE OF OPERATING PROFIT</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">One reason why operating profit is such an important number in the income statement is precisely that it represents the revenues earned less all the operating, or non-financial, expenses of the business. These expenses are the ones that are usually capable of being charged to the responsibility of the operating, as distinct from financial, managers within the business, even if the process of assigning responsibility is not necessarily easy. Interest, tax and dividends belong in deep finance territory. There is one respect, however, in which an operating manager, such as an IT manager, may be given discretion to encroach into deep finance territory, and that is in the matter of leasing. Managers may be given authority to incur capital expenditure up to a given amount. While in some companies the decision as to how equipment (IT equipment, for example) is to be financed is always left to the finance function to decide, in others managers are given discretion whether to purchase or lease.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">It should by now be apparent that much of the information needed to determine the actual revenues and costs of individual divisions or departments is the same as that needed to determine the financial results of the business as a whole, but analysed in different ways. For example, the sales achieved by Supermarkets A and B in a supermarket chain will no doubt be used to measure the performance against budget of their respective managers. However, together with the sales achieved by all the other shops operated by the business, they will be part of the total sales of the business that will be shown in the group income statement. The various costs and expenses of manufacturing at a particular factory of a worldwide manufacturing company will be used to measure the performance against budget of the manager of that particular factory. They will also be incorporated in the company’s group accounts. However, they may also be part of the performance measurement of the company’s European Region, its local operation, and of a particular product line that is manufactured in several different parts of the world. The essence of the requirement is to be able to analyse the same data in many different ways, a task greatly facilitated, of course, by IT systems.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">It should by now be apparent that, in all but the smallest organisations, budgeting is usually a combination of several things: the delegation of responsibility, the allocation of resources, forecasting and the measurement of performance against forecast. It is also a means of influencing the behaviour of managers and provides a basis for rewarding them according to their performance. However, just as a business is itself a dynamic entity that needs to adapt to meet changing circumstances, so should budgeting systems also be adaptable. By their nature, budgets are formulated before the period to which they relate. Budgeting procedures should be sufficiently flexible to allow managers to take advantage of opportunities or react to situations that could not have been foreseen at the time the budget was prepared.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-8">CAPITAL EXPENDITURE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As already mentioned, most budgeting systems distinguish between ‘capital expenditure’ and ‘revenue expenditure’ (or ‘expense’). Capital expenditure usually has the following characteristics:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>It is money spent on long- or medium-term assets or projects.</li>
<li>The amounts are substantial in the context of the organisation.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">New funding is often required.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">As a simple example, imagine that you wish to set up in business as a taxi driver. Your obvious item of capital expenditure is a taxi: a long-term asset costing what is, for you, a lot of money, which you would probably have to borrow. Examples of IT expenditure usually thought of as ‘capital’ would be most items of hardware and lump sum charges for software. If software for internal use is to be developed in-house rather than bought or licensed, then the development costs would be regarded as capital.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">Budget-holders often have authority to commit up to a given amount on ‘capital’ items; beyond that they have to obtain approval through a defined procedure. As already mentioned, some budget-holders also have authority to decide on the financing method (whether an acquisition should be leased or purchased); others do not.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-9">REVENUE EXPENDITURE OR ‘EXPENSE’</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Revenue expenditure usually has the following characteristics:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>It is the consequence of earlier capital acquisitions.</li>
<li>It is short term.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">It is usually funded out of day-to-day revenue.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In the taxi business, examples of revenue expenditure would be road tax, insurance, fuel and maintenance. You would expect to pay these out of the fares earned, and if you could not do so then you would have a problem. The fares should also, of course, be sufficient to cover the depreciation of the taxi and provide a reasonable profit. Examples of typical IT revenue expenditure would include power costs, insurance and personnel costs, other than those that may be regarded as ‘capital’ (see above). They also usually include those things often described collectively as ‘services’. These may be anything from training, and the maintenance of hardware and software, to the complete outsourcing of every aspect of IT. In the latter case, all IT expenditure would be regarded as expense, none as capital.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">How much flexibility?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Organisations differ in their flexibility towards budgets. Some have detailed procedures and apply them rigidly, while others are more flexible. Where flexibility is permitted, some IT expenditures may be argued either way. For expenditures normally regarded as ‘capital’, there may be grounds for arguing that they can be treated as ‘expense’ and vice versa.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">As an example, ‘installation services’ are concerned with installing IT and communications systems and making them work in a particular organisation’s environment. It could be argued that the cost of these services should be regarded as an integral part of the capital cost of the systems to be depreciated over their estimated useful lives, because without the services the systems would not work. It would follow from this argument that the total costs, including the services, should be ‘capitalised’ (shown as an asset on the statement of financial position) and also charged against a capital budget.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">On the other hand, it could be argued that the service is ‘used up’ as soon as it has been completed, in which case the cost should be regarded as revenue expenditure. From this argument it would follow that the expense should be charged against the income statement of the period in which it is incurred, and also charged against an expense budget. None of this is intended as an incitement to transgress accounting rules or company procedures. It is merely to point out that sometimes there are different ways of looking at things.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-10">BUDGETS AND LEASING</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">Another example of differing flexibility towards budgets concerns organisations’ attitudes to leasing, particularly operating leases. Payments under operating leases are, you may recall, treated as expenses for both accounting and tax purposes, being charged direct to the income statement. For budgeting purposes, some organisations use this as sufficient justification for regarding operating lease payments as revenue expenditure. If the availability of the lease makes the proposed investment more affordable, then this may materially affect the decision whether to proceed.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">By contrast, other organisations regard the decision about how an investment will be financed (the ‘financing decision’) as quite separate from the decision about whether to undertake it in the first place (the ‘investment decision’). According to this view, if the investment being proposed is ‘capital’ by nature, then it will be regarded as ‘capital’ for budgeting purposes. How it is then financed, whether by operating lease or in some other way, will not affect the investment decision.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Treatment of interest</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">There is one other aspect of leasing that is relevant here. Already mentioned is that it is a principle of budgeting only to charge to budget-holders those costs over which they have some control. This does not usually prevent arguments about the justice or otherwise of ‘cross-charges’ from other departments. However, it does usually mean that only relevant items above the ‘operating profit’ line are charged out to budget-holders. The ‘financial expenses’ of the company (interest, tax and dividends) are not, at least not directly.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">So, interest on funds used to purchase assets outright, out of central company funds, would usually not be charged out. Interest on leases, however, usually does get charged to the budget-holder, along with other relevant expenses, because the interest is an integral part of the lease payments. For this reason, leasing may be rejected by a budget-holder who at the same time may regard it as desirable, both operationally, and in other respects, financially. This is an example of how procedural aspects of budgeting can affect business decisions. It is an unfortunate fact of business life that an adverse effect on a departmental budget may sometimes prevent the doing of something that would in fact be for the benefit of a company as a whole and therefore of its shareholders. Where such a conflict arises it is helpful to remember that most of the shareholders neither know nor care whether their company is divisionalised or departmentalised. They have invested in the company as a whole, not in the ‘sundries and miscellaneous’ department, and they expect their money to be spent with only one purpose: the maximisation of their wealth.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Treatment of sale proceeds</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">While departmental budgets are charged with expenditure on capital assets, in some organisations they are not credited with any proceeds of sale. This practice, quite common in some long-established companies, often originated many years ago when most business assets were big and heavy, were expected to last a long time and to have negligible residual values. To allow inertia to let such a practice to continue today, however, can be to seriously restrict the ability of the manager of an IT, or other ‘high-tech’, department to manage the department’s assets in an optimum way. It has to be questioned whether it is an appropriate practice with respect to IT and similar assets, whose useful lives may, for good business reasons, be short and whose residual values may be significant.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Actual versus budget</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In the forgoing paragraphs we have considered budgeting as a way of planning the deployment of a company’s financial resources over a period and delegating some authority to individual managers to decide how they should be used. Earlier in the book we looked in some detail at what is often known as ‘capital budgeting’. This is the process of using financial methods to help decide which particular investment or project, of two or more possible alternatives, would give the best ‘return’. If a project is undertaken for a customer, then the benefits will be an increase in external revenue; if it is an internal one, then the benefits are more likely to consist primarily of reduced costs.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Budgeting, of either kind, is a pointless exercise unless the actual costs and benefits are monitored and controlled against the budget. The chart in <a href="23_FinanceforIT_chapter11.xhtml#img195">Figure 11.1</a> is an example of a diagrammatic way of recording actual project costs and comparing them with budgets, forecasts and, where relevant, revenues. The particular example happens to concern a project, and an external one at that, but the principle is applicable to any ‘budget versus actual’ situation.</p>

<div class="box">
<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText2">So far in this chapter we have covered the first three of its objectives. In particular:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have looked at budgeting and why it is such an important activity, especially in departmentalised organisations, and looked at its benefits and inherent dangers;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have considered how budgeting, sometimes called ‘responsibility accounting’, is often used as a motivation and measurement tool, especially in departmentalised organisations;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have distinguished between ‘capital expenditure’ and ‘revenue expenditure’, and considered personal and business IT examples of each.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-11"><span class="no-style-override">COSTING AND PRICING</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In the previous section we discussed the fact that at the heart of budgeting is the process of estimating in advance the revenues likely to be achieved and the costs likely to be incurred by a business and by its various subdivisions during some future period. However, to a considerable extent we glossed over just how difficult it can sometimes be to determine what those costs might be. ‘What did it cost?’ A simple enough question, you might think, when applied to a recent purchase. ‘CU15,000’, you might answer in the case of a new car, or ‘CU1’ for a loaf of bread, or ‘CU40’ in the case of a PC software package. That is indeed what those items might cost us, the cost to us being the price charged by the supplier. However, the question ‘what did it cost the supplier to produce the car, or the loaf of bread or the software package?’ is not nearly so easy to answer.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">There are several reasons why it is important to understand cost. Most obviously, if we do not know how much a product or service costs to produce or provide, then how can we know how much to charge for it in order to make a reasonable profit? Second, in a competitive world there is always pressure to reduce prices. The only way to improve or maintain profit may be to reduce costs. If we do not know which costs are attributable to which product or service, then we cannot know which costs we should try to reduce, or which products should be discontinued because they can never be profitable. Third, some businesses have a choice of making or buying certain parts or components, while most businesses can choose whether to provide certain functions in-house, for example IT, or to buy them externally, to outsource. Not knowing the cost of in-house provision would make it impossible to exercise that choice sensibly.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">A very simple business</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">To get a taste for some aspects of this subject we shall look at some easy examples, starting with the simplest kind of business imaginable. Like Fred (see <a href="15_FinanceforIT_chapter03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>), Mary sells tins of beans from a market stall. Suppose that her stall is rent free, that supplies are delivered from the supplier each day, that she sells all the tins that are delivered and that she has no other costs. Each tin costs her CU1 and she sells it for CU1.50, that is at a profit of 50c. Her markup (profit as a percentage of purchase price) is therefore 50 per cent. Probably not bad for tins of beans, but the numbers are only for illustration. Her profit margin (profit as a percentage of sales) is therefore 33.3 per cent. The more tins she sells the more profit she makes. If she sells 1,000 tins, then her cost of sales would be CU1,000, her revenue would be CU1,500 and her profit CU500. If she sells 10,000 tins, then her cost of sales would be CU10k, her revenue would be CU15k and her profit CU5k. Let us suppose that she actually sells 100,000 tins in a year. Her cost of sales would be CU100k, her revenue would be CU150k and her profit CU50k.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Let us also suppose that from time to time Mary draws out some of her profit in cash to live on. The tax authorities have not yet caught up with her. For the purpose of the examples that follow we shall avoid the debate about whether proprietor’s ‘salary’ should be a charge against profit or a distribution of profit. We shall treat it as the latter, that is as a distribution of profit, the same view that tax authorities usually take. So the profit of Mary’s business is indeed CU50k.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-12"><span class="no-style-override">VARIABLE COSTS</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Why were the above calculations so easy? The reason is that all the costs of the business vary directly with the quantity of goods sold; in other words, all the costs are variable costs, in this case simply the costs of the daily supply of tins. The more Mary buys and sells, the more profit she makes, ad infinitum. A variable cost is defined as a cost that varies proportionally with a chosen unit. In this case, the unit is the number of tins sold. In a manufacturing business, the chosen unit might be the number of items manufactured; in a software house it might be number of lines of code written. The relationship between Mary’s revenue, costs and profit can be represented by the chart in <a href="23_FinanceforIT_chapter11.xhtml#img197">Figure 11.2</a>.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img197" src="images/img197.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1455" height="1051"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">All businesses try to reduce their costs. Suppose that Mary were able to find a new supplier who would only charge her 80c per tin instead of CU1. If she were able to maintain her selling price of CU1.50, then her profit per tin sold would increase from 50c to 70c. What would be the effect of all this on Mary’s profit at her current volume of sales of 100,000? Her only expense (cost of sales) will be reduced by (100,000 × 20c =) CU20k for her current volume of sales. What is this reduction worth to Mary’s business? Since profit is the difference between revenue and expenses, and what Mary has done is to reduce her cost of sales, the benefit is to increase her profit by the same amount, that is by CU20k, but only at her current volume of sales. Halve the sales, and halve the benefit; double the sales, double the benefit, and so on.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-13">FIXED COSTS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Now let us assume that the local council has caught up with Mary and that she is being charged CU20k per year rent for her pitch. You might think that this is rather excessive, and indeed it is, but the purpose is to illustrate a point not to reflect the true economics of running a market stall. As long as Mary chooses to park her stall she must pay the CU20k even if she never sells a single tin of beans. In other words, her business has joined the great majority of businesses that, in order to earn revenue, incur fixed costs as well as variable (see <a href="23_FinanceforIT_chapter11.xhtml#img198">Figure 11.3</a>).</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img198" src="images/img198.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1050"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Before, every tin of beans that Mary sold yielded a profit of 50c, which she regarded, with only the occasional glance over her shoulder at the tax authorities, as her own. Now, however, the surplus from the first few tens of thousands of tins sold does not belong to her at all, but has to go towards paying her rent. The sums are easy: each tin sold, starting with the very first, now contributes 50c towards paying the rent, the fixed cost. However, by itself the ‘contribution’ from selling the first tin is obviously nowhere near enough.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-14">CONTRIBUTION</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">How many tins are required to make the total contribution required in this case? Well, if the rent comes to CU20k and if each tin contributes 50c, then the required number is (CU20k divided by 50c =) 40,000. This is the number of tins that must be sold in order that the business can just pay its fixed costs. At this level of sales Mary’s business makes neither a profit nor a loss. Sales are just sufficient to cover the total costs. The business is said to ‘break-even’ (see <a href="23_FinanceforIT_chapter11.xhtml#img199">Figure 11.4</a>). Sell one tin fewer and the business makes a loss of 50c. This in turn means that Mary must pay the last 50c of the rent out of her own pocket. Sell one tin more and her business has made a profit of 50c; all subsequent tins sold add to her profit. Notice that the fixed costs represent a direct reduction in profit and the reduction is the same regardless of the level of sales. The profit had been CU50k; the introduction of fixed costs of CU20k has directly reduced the profit: to CU30k. Had the original profit been CU35k, then it would be reduced to CU15k, and so on.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img199" src="images/img199.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1053"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Suppose now that Mary complains about the amount of the rent and succeeds in having it reduced from CU20k to CU10k. What is the benefit of this reduction to her business? The answer is probably obvious. Precisely because fixed costs are, by definition, fixed and independent of the level of sales, the benefit of a reduction in fixed costs is an increase in profit of the same amount, regardless of the level of sales. If the fixed costs have decreased by CU10k, then the profit must have increased by CU10k. Furthermore, if the fixed costs are now less than they were, a correspondingly smaller contribution is required to cover them. So, the break-even point must now occur at a lower sales volume.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">As before, the break-even point can be worked out arithmetically or by means of a simple diagram. How many tins must be sold in order to make the total contribution to fixed costs now required? The fixed costs (the rent) now come to CU10k. Each tin sold contributes 50c; therefore the number of tins that must be sold is (CU10k / 50c =) 20,000. This is now the number of tins that must be sold in order for Mary to break-even, as shown in <a href="23_FinanceforIT_chapter11.xhtml#img200">Figure 11.5</a>. The term ‘fixed cost’ is frequently used, but can be misleading. If Mary were to become really successful she might acquire another stall, at which point her fixed costs would go up, because she would have to pay rent on that too, as well as having to pay wages to someone to serve on it. Ultimately, all fixed costs become variable. We could say as a general rule that the benefit of a reduction in fixed costs is an increase in profit equal to that reduction. The amount of the benefit per year will be independent of the level of sales but only up to a certain point. Beyond that point the fixed costs may increase.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img200" src="images/img200.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1057"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Given the simple definition of profit to which we have reverted in this chapter, namely that it is revenue less expenses, then it follows that there are two ways of increasing profit: reducing expenses or increasing revenue. Mary has already had considerable success in reducing both her variable and fixed costs. If she wants further to increase her profit, then the only remaining option is to increase revenue, and there are two ways in which this might be done: she could sell more tins at the same price or she could increase the selling price.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Market research</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Before deciding upon either approach, it would make sense for Mary to conduct a little market research, which means finding out what customers want and what they are prepared to pay for it. The fact that she already sells all of her inventory every day suggests that if only she could accommodate some more inventory she might well be able to sell it at the current price. Does she have space for storing more inventory during the day free of charge, perhaps on the ground under her stall? If so, then she would be in the ideal position of being able to increase her sales at no extra cost other than the obvious cost of additional purchases. In particular, she would not have the awkward job of trying to forecast in advance whether she could make enough extra sales in order to recoup extra fixed costs. This would be for the good reason that no extra fixed costs would be incurred.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">If, on the other hand, Mary could not find any free storage space, then her options would appear to be as follows: she may be able to sub-rent some currently unused space under a neighbouring stall or she could start a second stall. Both of these options would, however, incur additional fixed costs. In the first case she would almost certainly have to agree a contract for sub-rent payable to the other stallholder. In the second case, as already discussed, she would have to pay both rent for her second stall and the wages of an employee to run it. In either case, she would need to do a little break-even analysis in order to work out how many additional tins she would need to sell in order to recoup her additional fixed costs.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-15">PRICE/VOLUME CALCULATIONS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Suppose on the other hand, that her market research suggests to Mary that at least most of her customers would indeed be prepared to pay more for her beans. She would now need to do a pricing exercise. Pricing simply means setting the price at which you will sell a product or service and it is about three things: cost, customers and competition. If your prices do not yield revenue that exceeds your total costs, then you make no profit. If your prices are higher than customers are prepared to pay, then you make no sales. Competition is what gives customers the choice. Suppose Mary believes that all her customers would be prepared to accept a five per cent price increase, but that if the increase were 10 per cent, then customers representing an estimated 10 per cent of her business would go elsewhere. What should she do? For what follows we revert to the original situation where the rent was CU20k, as shown in <a href="23_FinanceforIT_chapter11.xhtml#img202-1">Table 11.1</a>. We can use this simple spreadsheet to test the effect of Mary’s various assumptions.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img202-1" src="images/img202-1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="716"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">First, suppose that she were able to increase her prices by five per cent and keep all her customers. <a href="23_FinanceforIT_chapter11.xhtml#img202-2">Table 11.2</a> shows the result: an increase in profit of CU7,500 to CU37,500. Now let us suppose that she were to increase her prices by 10 per cent but in so doing were to lose 10 per cent of her customers (see <a href="23_FinanceforIT_chapter11.xhtml#img203">Table 11.3</a>). In this case her profit, at CU38,500 would be slightly more than that yielded by the price increase of only five per cent. However, she might well conclude that it would not make long-term business sense to risk losing 10 per cent of her customers for the very small short-term gain of an extra CU1,000 in profit.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Suppose that Mary is indeed favouring the option of raising prices by five per cent. Before deciding, however, it would make sense to revisit the option of selling more tins at the same price. The question now is ‘how many extra tins would she have to sell in order to make at least the additional profit of CU7,500 that she believes the five per cent price increase would produce?’ Once again, you would use the spreadsheet to do the work for you. However, if you like arithmetic, here are the calculations. At the original price, the contribution made by each tin sold is 50c, or 33.33 per cent of selling price. In order to obtain an extra CU7,500 of contribution, and therefore of profit, she would have to sell (CU7500/50c =) 15,000 extra tins. If she has to pay a sub-rent of, say, CU2,000 per year for her neighbour’s spare space, then Mary would have to sell a further (CU2000/50c =) 4,000 tins to cover her increased fixed costs, 19,000 extra tins in all. So, her final decision might be ‘should I increase prices by five per cent with no increase in fixed costs and risk losing some customers (even though gut-feel tells me I wouldn’t lose any) or should I try to increase my sales volume, but with the risk that I might possibly not even cover the additional fixed costs that I would incur?’</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img202-2" src="images/img202-2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="722"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img203" src="images/img203.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="717"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">At this point we shall leave Mary to her decision-making, with which we can probably help her no further. Notice that all the calculations that she has done so far, and the financial statements that she has produced, have all been entirely for her own purposes, to help her manage her business and make decisions about it. They are all purely for internal consumption, and because of that, remember that there are no laws or any other rules that govern what they contain or indeed dictate that they have to be produced at all. If we did not know it already, and wanted to give a collective name to all these statements, accounts and charts that are purely for management purposes, and the process of producing and using them, then perhaps ‘management accounting’ might have come to mind. In fact that is the frequently used collective term for all the activities described in this chapter.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-16">COSTING IN MANUFACTURING</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">For a look at another aspect of the large subject of costing we shall turn to the manufacturing industry. Think of a business that assembles PCs from bought-in components. Suppose that each PC uses CU300 of components and takes one person three hours to assemble. If the cost of the person is CU20 per hour, then the labour cost per PC is CU60, and the cost to the business of assembling it is the materials plus the labour, a total of CU360. However, is this the full cost of assembling the PC? It might be, but only if the assembly work were being done in a rent-free field, if the components found their way there automatically without being ordered or checked on delivery, if those components could be used immediately without being stored somewhere until they were needed, and if the business could somehow survive without any administration or accounting staff.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In reality, of course, the assembly work is done in a building, for which rent, insurance, power and cleaning costs have to be paid; the components have to be ordered, and checked on delivery, moved into a store and eventually issued to the production line: all by people who would quite like to be paid. Then there are other costs, more remote from the production process, but costs nevertheless: the costs of selling the product, such as advertising and sales staff; and the costs of administering the business: accounts and secretarial staff, and office costs and equipment.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">All these costs are also part of the total costs of all the PCs assembled. What is the essential difference between these costs and the costs of labour and materials? The answer is that labour and material costs are obviously related directly to the assembly of the PCs, whereas the others are not. We can see the person assembling that particular PC, measure how long the work takes, and therefore easily work out the labour cost of producing it. We can see the materials being put into that particular PC and therefore, knowing what the materials cost, can easily work out the materials cost of producing it. The emphasis is deliberately on the word ‘easily’. These costs, labour and materials, can easily be directly related to the product being assembled. For this reason, they are called direct costs.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Indirect costs</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">All the other costs that we considered are called, not surprisingly, indirect costs or sometimes overhead costs. Indirect costs or overheads are simply those costs that cannot easily be related directly to the product. Suppose that, just because it was too difficult to relate these indirect costs to an individual PC, they were simply ignored. Would we base our prices on just the direct costs? Of course not. Remember that in order to make a profit a business has to earn revenue that exceeds its total costs. Total means what it says: all costs, both direct and indirect.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">‘Easy’, one might be tempted to say. ‘At the end of the year we shall know exactly what all the costs are, indirect as well as direct, and we’ll simply apportion the indirects equally among the products that have been made. If we’ve made 10,000 products and supposing that the total of the indirect costs is CU2 million, then the proportion of indirect costs attributable to each product will be (CU2 million/10,000 =) CU200. As long as wage rates and material costs remain the same, then the direct costs of each product will be CU360. Each product’s share of the indirect costs would be CU200, so its total cost would be (CU360 + CU200 =) CU560. Suppose we are aiming for a profit margin of 20 per cent? To achieve it, our selling price would have to be (CU560/0.8 =) CU700.’</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Unfortunately, there are some fairly obvious flaws in the above argument. Chief among them is that if we wait until the end of the year to know the actual indirect costs before fixing our selling price we shall no longer have a business. It helps to have a price in order to make a sale. What is the solution to this little problem? The answer is provided by the activity described in the first section of this chapter. It is to estimate in advance, as accurately as we can, what the indirect costs will be and how many products will be made, and use the estimated or budgeted numbers. So, the budgeted indirect cost of each product would be the result of dividing the total budgeted indirect costs by the estimated number of products to be produced. For pricing purposes, such calculations might be adequate. Indeed, since pricing has to be done in advance, such calculations would usually have to be adequate.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Calculating total cost</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">But accounting is a continuous process. Business managers want to know as they go along what the costs and revenues of the business are and therefore what its profit is to date. So, for each product that is made, the accounting system should ideally record its total cost there and then or, rather, its total budgeted cost. Since the direct costs are, by definition, those that can easily be attributed directly to an individual product, one way of doing this would be simply to work out what percentage the indirects bear to the direct costs and apply a corresponding percentage uplift each time that direct costs are recorded. In the example above, the budgeted direct costs of each product were CU360 and the budgeted indirects were CU200. 200 as a percentage of 360 is 55.56 per cent. So a simple way for the accounting system to do what management requires would be always to add 55.56 per cent of the direct costs as an uplift.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">So far so good, provided of course that we actually produce the estimated number of products. However, the question then becomes ‘should we base the uplift on the total of the direct costs, or would it be better to base it on only one component of them?’ What is wrong with using total direct costs? In some businesses, there is nothing wrong at all. However, in others, the price of materials is volatile. For example, oil prices are subject to considerable fluctuation based on both supply and, sometimes, political factors; the prices of crops, whether cocoa beans or carrots, vary according to whether the harvest has been good or bad. So, businesses manufacturing chocolate or baby food may find the price of their most important raw materials changing considerably during a year. Should the amount added for overheads fluctuate in sympathy with rises and falls in the price of materials? Of course not.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Are labour rates as volatile as the prices of some materials? Usually not. Certainly they do not usually come down, and increases are usually modest, especially in times of low inflation, and are reasonably predictable. For this reason, and because in past times direct labour accounted for the major part of product costs, direct labour is what has historically been the main basis for allocating indirect costs. In our example, direct labour costs are CU60 per product. Using the same ‘percentage uplift’ method that we used above, the budgeted direct labour costs of each product were CU60 and the budgeted indirects were CU200. 200 as a percentage of 60 is 333.33 per cent. So the way the accounting system might allocate indirects on the basis of direct labour would be always to add 333.33 per cent of the direct labour costs as an uplift. However, direct labour costs now represent a much lower proportion of total costs than they once did.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Many manufacturing businesses are becoming more and more automated, with machines doing much of the work previously done by people. Just as you can see a person assembling a PC, so you can see a machine doing the same thing if the assembly process has been automated. And just as the cost of employing the person to do the work is known and reasonably predictable, so is the cost of employing the machine. The purchase price of the machine is known, and its likely number of productive hours will also be known, from which a cost per hour used can be derived. Add its power costs and maintenance costs, which are also reasonably predictable, and you have an estimated total cost per machine-hour. If the machine is solely used for working on one product, then the cost of machine-hours is a direct cost attributable to that product, just as the cost of labour-hours was. If the machine is used for two hours per product and costs CU15 per hour of use, then the direct machine cost attributable to each product is (CU15 × 2 =) CU30. If the machine is used in the manufacture of several different products, then the costs of machine hours devoted to each product are direct costs attributable to each of the different products.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">If a particular machine is used for short but varying periods on a very large number of different products, then it may be neither easy nor economically feasible to determine with sufficient precision the time spent upon each individual item. In this case, the costs of the machine no longer satisfy our criteria for being treated as direct costs, so they would be treated as indirect and be added to all the other indirect costs, to be allocated to particular products in whatever way has been determined.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch11-17">ART VERSUS SCIENCE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Every different kind of business has its own particular kind of costing problems. This section should have given you an idea of some of the problems that costing tries to answer. If by now you have gained the impression that costing is a subject that is both quite complex and more art than science, then you would be right, and we have only considered quite simple examples. One thing that can be said, however, to close our brief excursion into this topic, is that the power of IT systems economically to record and analyse large amounts of individually quite small data items has helped to take just a little of the art out of costing and replace it with science.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For example, in the case of the machine, cited above, which is used for varying periods on a very large number of different products, it may now be economically feasible to allocate the costs of its use directly to the products on which it is used whereas it would not have been in earlier times. To the extent that costs previously treated as indirect, and therefore subject to some estimated basis of allocation, might now be economically treated as direct, so costing becomes more accurate. The more accurate the data used for business decision-making, the better the decisions are likely to be. In fact, that sentence could be said to represent the theme of this book.</p>

<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="boxText2">The main points of this chapter, linked to its objectives, have been:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>A budget is a financial plan setting targets for the revenues and expenditures of an organisation for a specified period.</li>
<li>In a departmental organisation, budgeting is also a way of allocating financial targets and resources to departmental managers, against which performance can be measured.</li>
<li>The characteristics of ‘capital expenditure’ are usually large (in context) amounts of new money spent infrequently on non-current assets; those of ‘revenue expenditure’ are usually frequent small amounts of money, financed from revenue, spent on replenishing current assets or on expenses.</li>
<li>Cost accounting (or costing) is the process of analysing and classifying elements of cost for the purpose of calculating as accurately as possible the total cost of a process, product or service. Costs are categorised as either ‘direct’ (those, such as materials and labour, that can usually be traced to a particular unit of cost in an economically feasible way), or ‘indirect’ (those that cannot be so traced).</li>
<li>Pricing is the process of determining the price that shall be charged for a product or service, usually by reference to costing information.</li>
