<p class="chapterTitle">2 DECISIONS, DECISIONS…</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch02-1">OBJECTIVES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="italic">When you have studied this chapter you should be able to:</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="italic">define ‘cash flow’ and explain its importance in financial decision-making;</span></li>
<li><span class="italic">build a simple financial case from a given set of data;</span></li>
<li><span class="italic">explain the importance of determining which cash flows are relevant to the investment being evaluated;</span></li>
<li><span class="italic">describe the concept known as ‘discounted cash flow’ and apply it to a simple financial case;</span></li>
<li><span class="italic">explain what is meant by ‘cost of money’ and ‘opportunity cost’;</span></li>
<li class="bullet-last"><span class="italic">describe the relationship between interest rates and inflation, and explain its relevance to financial decision-making.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch02-2"><span class="no-style-override">WHAT IS CASH FLOW?</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">From time to time we do what we call back-of-envelope calculations to test whether a particular idea is worth pursuing or not. For example, should we stay in this house that is cheap to run but involves expensive commuting costs, or move nearer to work, but to a more expensive area? Should we keep the old car that is getting expensive to maintain or replace it with a newer one that will involve an initial cost but will be cheaper to run? Most such decisions, whether personal or business, have the following characteristics:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>There is a choice of two actions – stay as we are or make a change.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">We are strongly, though not exclusively, influenced by the effect on our cash flow.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Cash flow means the movement of money (cash) to or from an individual or an organisation.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch02-3">A FINANCIAL CASE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">We shall use as an example the decision whether to keep the old car or to change it. Our approach would probably be to choose a reasonable evaluation period, perhaps three years, and then jot down estimates of the costs of each alternative. The estimates might look like those in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img26">Table 2.1</a>. Please look at it. We would usually try, by taking into account expected price increases, to estimate the amounts of actual cash that will have to be spent on these costs.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img26" src="images/img26.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="874"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">If you have an envelope handy, please now use the back of it to work out which of the alternatives you think is the best deal. Should you keep the old car or trade it in for the new one? <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img27">Table 2.2</a> shows you an answer. Note that for clarity in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img27">Table 2.2</a> and throughout the book I have adopted the convention of showing cash outflows and (later) expenses as negative numbers.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The ‘whole project’ approach</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">However you did the calculations, they probably look something like those in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img27">Table 2.2</a>. If we wanted a commonly used term that describes <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img27">Table 2.2</a>, we could call it a ‘financial case’. What does it tell us? If we keep the old car our net cash expenditure over the chosen period will be CU14,848. If we trade it in, it will be only CU14,404. By trading in, we should therefore be better off in cash terms by CU444. Note the phrase ‘in cash terms’. Whether this means that the trade-in is actually the best deal financially remains to be seen. Meanwhile, a few comments about <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img27">Table 2.2</a> itself will be helpful: how it is set out, what it contains and what it excludes.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">First, <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img27">Table 2.2</a> probably looks much like the back of your envelope, except possibly for one thing. In the case of the ‘new’ project I have separated (into ‘Year 0’) those cash flows – the initial expenditure and receipt – that could be said to represent the start of the ‘project’, from the others, such as running costs, that represent the consequences of a decision to proceed with it. This is both a conventional and convenient way of setting out project cash flows, for reasons that will become clear later.</span></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img27" src="images/img27.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1256"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Second, just as you probably did, I have excluded the original cost of the old car. Why? One reason is that it would be the same in both cases. However, another reason is that we can only make decisions about the future, not the past. We may possibly regret having spent CU7,000 on the old car three years ago, but nothing can bring that money back. Past expenditure, whether of CU7,000 or CU7 billion, that cannot be recovered is called a ‘sunk cost’. For those who had to make decisions about whether to continue with it, once started, the tunnel under the English Channel, for example, would have provided a constant reminder of the meanings, both real and metaphorical, of ‘sunk cost’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Sunk costs are irrelevant to decision-making and should therefore be excluded from cash flow estimates designed to assist it. They are, of course, relevant for other purposes. For example, we may wish to know the total costs incurred on the old car from when we bought it until today. Although these are all sunk costs, they are relevant for that particular purpose. However, they are not relevant for the purpose of deciding on a future course of action. We shall come across other examples of things that should be excluded from financial cases that are to be used as aids to decision-making.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The third thing to notice about <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img27">Table 2.2</a> is that it shows two cash flow estimates, one for each course of action. This is not the shortest way of setting out project cash flows, neither is it necessarily the most convenient, especially when, as in this case, there are only two alternatives. However, it may be the only practicable approach for complex financial cases or where there are more than two alternatives to consider. Aptly, it is sometimes called the ‘whole project’ approach.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The ‘combined’ approach</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">There is, however, a shorter and sometimes more convenient way of producing cash flow estimates. With the car ‘project’, as with many business examples, we are comparing only two alternatives – ‘continue as we are’ or ‘do something different’. Where this is so, we could combine everything into one case. Where this can conveniently be done it may be easier to use and be more informative than the whole project approach. An example of the combined approach is shown in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img28">Table 2.3</a>. It lies between the whole project approach and the fully ‘incremental’ approach that we shall consider shortly. With one exception, <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img28">Table 2.3</a> contains the same level of detail, and of course gives the same result, as did the ‘whole project’ approach. However, similar items are now paired, thus making it easier to compare them.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img28" src="images/img28.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="1350"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The exception referred to in the previous paragraph is that road tax has been excluded. It could have been included, but to do so would be a waste of space, because it is the same in each option. Whichever option is chosen, it would be unchanged by the decision. We have thus identified something else that should be excluded from financial cases to be used as aids to decision-making – things that, although cash flows and although in the future, will be unaffected by the decision.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The ‘incremental’ approach</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Given a choice of more numbers to look at or fewer, most people would choose fewer. The fully incremental approach, illustrated in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img29">Table 2.4</a>, allows us to present the cash flow estimates with a minimum of detail. It shows only the incremental changes to cash flows that would occur if the ‘new’ project were to be decided upon. A glance at <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img29">Table 2.4</a> will, I think, prove the point that it is easier to read and digest than the other formats, while giving the same result.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img29" src="images/img29.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="791"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Both the ‘combined’ and the ‘incremental’ forms (<a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img28">Tables 2.3</a> and <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img29">2.4</a>) have the added advantage over the ‘whole project’ form that their bottom lines show the net changes to cash flow year by year. They show in which years we shall need more cash, and how much. From this we can determine how much we shall have to borrow, or by how much our own cash resources will be depleted, and when. We can also see when we can expect net cash inflows that will allow borrowings to be repaid or cash mountains to be replenished.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText2">So far in this chapter we have covered the first three of its objectives. In particular:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have defined ‘cash flow’;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have examined three possible approaches to setting out financial cases;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have identified the two main characteristics of cash flows that are relevant to decision-making – they will occur in the future, and they will differ among the alternatives.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch02-4"><span class="no-style-override">WHAT IS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW?</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Whichever of the three approaches we choose, if our estimates prove to be exactly right (which would of course be extremely unlikely), then by trading in, we should be better off in cash terms by CU444 compared with keeping the old car. I raised earlier the question of whether this means that the trade-in is actually the best deal from a financial point of view. It would be a pity to have done all this work, or the much greater amount of work involved in evaluating a real IT investment, only to use it inappropriately in making the decision.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">What does ‘better off’ mean?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">You might ask how there could possibly be any ambiguity. The numbers show clearly that by trading in we should be CU444 better off in cash terms. Indeed they do. However, we have first to seek the answers to two questions: what do we mean by ‘better off’ and what do we mean by ‘currency units’? In the answer to the second question lies the answer to the first, so what <span class="italic">do</span> we mean by currency units?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Please look closely at <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img30">Table 2.5</a>. It shows three amounts of money, 100 units each, receivable today. But units of what? The answer is 100 each of pounds, dollars and Swiss francs. It may be nice to know that we are to receive these sums, but we should also like to know what it all amounts to in, for example, pounds today. So we would apply conversion factors (exchange rates) to convert units of non-pounds to pounds. Please now look at <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img31-1">Table 2.6</a>. Supposing there are currently $2 to a pound, and SFr2.5 to a pound, we can now see the answer to what we wanted to know. Expressed in the units that tell us how much better off we shall be today, in this case pounds, the answer is £190.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">By looking at the headings in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img30">Table 2.5</a> we knew immediately that we were dealing with amounts that were being expressed in unlike units. We knew, therefore, that to make sense of what they might mean to us in real terms, we would have to convert them all to a single unit of our choosing, using appropriate conversion factors. In this particular case we chose to use pounds.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img30" src="images/img30.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="330"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img31-1" src="images/img31-1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="529"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">When is a pound not a pound?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">What, you may wonder, was the point of that rather trivial little exercise? To answer that question, now please look at <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img31-2">Table 2.7</a>. It too represents three amounts of money, 100 units of each. However, unlike <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img30">Table 2.5</a>, in which the amounts were all receivable today but in different currencies, now the amounts are all receivable in similar units but at different times – today, one year from today and two years from today.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img31-2" src="images/img31-2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1453" height="315"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The question is: do we have a similar problem to the one that we faced in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img30">Table 2.5</a>? Indeed we do, but the nature of the problem is less obvious. In <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img30">Table 2.5</a>, we knew that we were dealing with unlike amounts because they had different signs. In <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img31-2">Table 2.7</a>, the same units are being used to represent values that are in fact as different in real terms as they would be if they were in different currencies. Why are the values different? The reason is that money received (or paid) in the future is not worth as much as money received today. If it were, and I were offering to give you CU100, you would be indifferent whether you received it today, a year from today, or 10 years from today.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch02-5">THE COST OF MONEY</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The fact is, however, that you would not be indifferent to when you received my CU100; you would like it now, thank you very much. But why? The reason is as follows. Suppose that you have an overdraft of CU100 from a bank that is charging you 10 per cent per annum interest. We could say that your current ‘cost of money’ is 10 per cent per annum. However, let us also suppose that you would like to pay off the overdraft. If you received my CU100 today you could do so; if you did not receive it until a year from today you could not. The reason is that a year from today the overdraft will have grown, with interest, to CU110, while my gift will not.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch02-6">PRESENT VALUE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">So, CU100 today will enable you to extinguish exactly a debt that would require CU110 to extinguish one year from today. We could say, therefore, that CU100 today is worth exactly the same to you as CU110 would be worth one year from today, if your cost of money is 10 per cent per annum during the intervening period.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Putting it the other way round, we could say that if your cost of money is 10 per cent per annum then CU110 received one year from today is actually worth only ten elevenths (100 / 110) of what it would have been worth had it been received today. The same holds true, of course, if the CU110 were payable one year from today rather than receivable. Finally, we could generalise and say that if the cost of money is 10 per cent per annum, then any sum receivable or payable one year from today is actually worth only ten elevenths (0.9091) of what it would have been worth had it been received or paid today.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Not all jargon is bad. If it were, then we IT people would be high on the list of culprits. Financial people use a few shorthand phrases that shorten considerably the last sentence in the previous paragraph. They would use ‘future value’ to mean the amount of cash receivable or payable in the future; they would use ‘present value’ instead of the rather long-winded ‘what it would have been worth had it been received or paid today’; and they would use the term ‘discount’ to describe the process of taking a larger number and turning it into a smaller one.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">So, with respect to our specific example, financial people would say that the present value of CU110 receivable one year from today, discounted at 10 per cent is CU100. To describe the generalisation, they would say that the present value (PV) of a cash flow one year from today, discounted at 10 per cent, is equal to 0.9091 (ten elevenths) of its future value (FV). Notice that the phrase ‘discounted at 10 per cent’ is not strictly accurate, but it is widely used, and generally understood, to mean ‘reduced to ten elevenths’, or 100 / (100 + 10). If the discount rate used had been eight per cent, then ‘discounted at eight per cent’ would mean ‘reduced to 100 / (100 + 8)’, and so on.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Nothing but simple arithmetic</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Tedious it may have been, but in the above example and its explanation we needed nothing but simple arithmetic, and that is the most difficult mathematics that you will encounter in the whole book. Finance is not a difficult subject, and I intend to keep proving the point. It is true that the numbers were easy. The arithmetic would certainly have been more tedious if the cash flow had been CU537, the cost of money 14 per cent and the period 17 years.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">To cater for the majority of situations, where the numbers are indeed not so easy, tables of discount factors were developed. You will find such a table in <a href="26_FinanceforIT_appendix1.xhtml">Appendix 1</a>, which also gives the formula from which the table was derived. <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img33">Table 2.8</a> shows a part of the table of present values.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img33" src="images/img33.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1700" height="848"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">If we did not already know the answer, and we wanted to use the discount table to solve the problem discussed above, the question, to remind you, would be this: what is the present value of CU110 receivable or payable one year in the future if we are discounting at 10 per cent? The way to use the table is to look down the left-hand side until you come to the 10 per cent row, then to look along until you come to the ‘one year’ column. The number that you find is 0.9091. What answer do you get if you then multiply 110 by 0.9091? The answer, of course, is 100.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Now please glance back to <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img31-2">Table 2.7</a>. It showed three amounts of CU100 receivable (or payable) respectively today, a year from today and two years from today. While in cash terms, the value of the amounts in total is of course CU300, we now know that, in real terms, it is rather less. How much less depends on the ‘cost of money’ of the receiver or payer. Supposing this to be 10 per cent, you may like to work out the answer for yourself. <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img34">Table 2.9</a> shows the answer. It is CU273.55.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img34" src="images/img34.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="651"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">A common currency</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The use of discount factors in the above example was analogous to the use of exchange rates in the previous one. Exchange rates were the means whereby we were able to represent cash flows expressed in unlike currencies (and therefore having different values) in a single common currency unit. Discount factors are the means whereby we can represent cash flows occurring at different times (and therefore having different values) in a single common unit – ‘today CUs’ or present values. Understanding this concept is vital if you are to understand what follows. It is even more important if you are to make sound judgements, or understand the judgements of others, about IT or other investment decisions in which you are involved.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText2">Since the previous checkpoint we have covered the fourth objective and part of the fifth objective of this chapter. In particular:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have discussed the main principles of discounted cash flow, and have seen how they are applied to a financial case;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have discussed what is meant by ‘cost of money’ and its importance in discounted cash flow calculations.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">We can now return to our little problem of whether to keep the old car or trade it in for a newer one. Please turn back to <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img29">Table 2.4</a>. You will recall that in cash terms the numbers tell us that trading in old for new is the best option.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2" id="ch02-7">NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Now assume that you expect your overdraft or credit card to cost 13 per cent per annum for the next three years. Let us now ask again: which is the best option financially – to keep the old car or to trade it in? A comparison of the cash numbers told us that the trade-in option would be cheaper by CU444 than would keeping the old car. Taking into account what we now know about what is often called the ‘time value of money’, is CU444 the number upon which we should base our decision? I think not. What number should our decision be based on? <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img36-1">Table 2.10</a> shows the solution, but try to avoid looking at it before you have attempted the answer for yourself. Assume for this exercise, and in practice for most present value calculations, that the cash flows in each year occur on the last day of that year.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Now please look at <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img36-1">Table 2.10</a>. First, notice that in order to work out the answer, we only need to use the bottom line of numbers from <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img29">Table 2.4</a> – the totals of the incremental cash flows. For the purpose of present value calculations, the detail from which those totals were derived has become irrelevant. If you enjoy this kind of thing, you could work out the present value of each individual cash flow and then add up all the answers. However, your final answer would be the same, so such an approach would need to be strictly for pleasure.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">What we did was to look up the 13 per cent discount factors for one, two and three years and multiply the net cash flows in each year by the respective discount factors. The result was the present values of the cash flows in each year. We then added together those present values to arrive at a total. This total is called the ‘net present value’ (NPV), because it is the sum of a series of individual present values, of which some are positive and some are negative. The NPV of these cash flows, discounted at our cost of money of 13 per cent, is −CU1,689.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Before we ask what that number actually means, let us perform one check on its correctness by doing present value calculations on the total cash flows of the two separate projects that we compiled earlier using the ‘whole project’ approach. Refer back to <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img27">Table 2.2</a> and do the calculations yourself if you would like more practice at them. The result is shown in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img36-2">Table 2.11</a>. Not surprisingly, the result is −CU1,689, the same as the one obtained by using the incremental method.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img36-1" src="images/img36-1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="738"/></p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img36-2" src="images/img36-2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1095"/></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch02-8">INTERPRETING PRESENT VALUES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The question is what does that number −CU1,689 actually mean? Remember that we are looking at two alternative projects: continue as we are (keep the old car) or do something different (trade it in). Remember also that we used the ‘incremental approach’. This was in order to determine the incremental effect on cash flows of trading in rather than choosing the alternative. Remember, finally, that by discounting the cash flows at our ‘cost of money’ we have taken into account that cost. By doing so, we have reflected the fact that later cash flows are worth less than earlier ones. In cash terms we worked out that we should be better off by CU444 trading in old for new. The net present value (NPV) of −CU1,689 tells us that by contrast, in real terms, we should actually be −CU1,689 worse off by trading in, and that therefore we should keep the old car. ‘In real terms’ means after taking into account what the money being used is costing us.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Why is there such a big difference, in this case as in many real ones, between the net incremental cash flow of ‘plus’ CU444, and the net present value of ‘minus’ CU1,689? Turning back to <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img36-1">Table 2.10</a>, the following factors in this particular example have contributed to it. First, 13 per cent is quite a high cost of money; overdrafts, and especially credit cards, do not come cheaply. Second, the biggest number in the financial case is the net cash outflow of CU8,000 in Year 0 – today. Because it occurs today it is not discounted. By contrast, the biggest cash inflow, of CU5,164, does not occur until Year 3, and it is therefore discounted quite heavily. This is an example of an unfortunate fact: that the universe was not constructed in a way that favours long-term projects. Why are the dice loaded against projects? It is because usually, although not necessarily, most of the big costs of projects occur at or near their beginning, and so are discounted hardly at all. By contrast, most of the benefits occur later in time, and they are therefore discounted more heavily.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Why we assumed an overdraft</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In the examples considered so far we have assumed that the individual evaluating the project has an overdraft. This is because our ultimate purpose will be to apply these principles to real business, specifically real IT, project evaluations. As discussed in <a href="13_FinanceforIT_chapter01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, all the money that any business has at its disposal is ‘on loan’ in one way or another. Businesses, and organisations in general, may certainly own the assets that they use, in the sense of having legal title. However, they do not ‘own’ the money – the financial resources – used to acquire them. They are custodians of money invested or lent by others.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">However, since we as individuals can and do own money, it is reasonable to ask how we should evaluate the car project were we ‘cash rich’, as the jargon has it – if we were using our own, rather than borrowed, money? If we were using our own money, could it be said to have a ‘cost’ for the purpose of doing present value calculations? The answer is that all money has a cost. This is most obvious if it is borrowed, but it is equally true if it is owned.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch02-9">OPPORTUNITY COST</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">If money is owned, it is capable of earning interest by being invested (whether it is actually invested or not). The cost of using owned money to invest in something else, such as a new car, is therefore the lost opportunity of earning income from the best alternative investment. The cost of this lost opportunity is usually called the ‘opportunity cost’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Suppose that the best currently available investment of acceptable risk for your money is a high interest savings account paying seven per cent per annum, and that you would use this money to finance the new car. At what rate, then, should the project cash flows be discounted? The answer would appear to be seven per cent. However, tax may be payable on interest received. What matters to us ultimately is not the quoted rate of interest, but what is left after tax. Suppose that would be five per cent. You may like to do the calculation, using a five per cent discount rate, and see if it makes any difference to the ‘advice’ offered by the financial model. <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img38">Table 2.12</a> shows the answer of −CU491. As you will have discovered, the NPV is still negative, but it is a much smaller negative number. It is a fact, although hardly a surprising one, that the lower the discount rate, the smaller will be the discount. The smaller the discount, then the smaller the difference between the cash numbers and their present values. The subject of tax, in the context of IT investment, is dealt with in <a href="19_FinanceforIT_chapter07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>.</p>

<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch02-10">‘FINANCIAL CASH FLOWS’</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Assuming that you did not do so earlier, it would be reasonable to ask why we have not included in the car project the ‘cash inflow’ from the bank of CU8,000, representing the increased overdraft if we were to buy the new car, and the ‘cash outflows’ represented by the finance costs and the eventual repayment of the loan. It could be argued that these are indeed cash flows attributable to the project. The answer is that they could be included, but that it would be pointless to do so because, as <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img39">Table 2.13</a> illustrates, they would be cancelled out by the discounting process. Please look at the table and make sure that you agree.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch02-11"><span class="no-style-override">INFLATION</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">So far we have not considered inflation. What is inflation? A working definition is that inflation is the erosion over time of the purchasing power of money. Suppose that you lend CU1 for a year at an interest rate of eight per cent, how much money will you have at the end of the year when the loan is repaid? The answer is, of course, CU1.08. If, during the year of the loan, inflation was five per cent per annum, then how much have you gained in terms of the purchasing power of your money? It is tempting to say three cents (eight cents less five cents) and that is very nearly right. In fact, the answer is about 2.85 cents, because the calculation is not 1.08 minus 1.05, but 1.08 divided by 1.05. The reason is that percentage rates of things such as interest and inflation are always applied multiplicatively, not additively.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img39" src="images/img39.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="875"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Consider the following example. Suppose that you are thinking of taking out an IT maintenance contract for three years. The first year costs CU4,000, payable today. It is not a fixed price contract, but you believe that payments will increase in line with inflation, which you assume will average five per cent over the period. You could produce your cash flow estimate in either of two ways, as follows:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>You could, using your estimate of five per cent inflation, work out what the actual future cash outflows would be, and it is this that you would then put into your financial case. If your cost of money is, say, 12 per cent, then you would use 12 per cent as the discount factor in discounting the cash flows. That is exactly what we did in the car example, and it is usually the simplest method to adopt, especially, as we shall see in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, when we consider financial aspects of outsourcing. Or,</li>
<li class="bullet-last">You could ignore inflation and use current, uninflated, numbers in your cash flow estimate. In this case, since the cash flows exclude inflation, then the discount rate should also exclude inflation, otherwise you would not be comparing like with like. If your cost of money is 12 per cent and inflation is five per cent, then what is your ‘real’ cost of money? 1.12 divided by 1.05 comes to 1.0667, so the answer is that your real cost of money is 6.67 per cent. This is not a nice number to work with, but it is nevertheless the one that you should use in this case to discount the uninflated cash flows.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml#img40">Table 2.14</a> demonstrates both of these approaches and shows, as you would expect, that both give the same present value (PV) for the cash flows. This means that you could use either method, and provided you use each correctly you would get the same answer.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img40" src="images/img40.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1454" height="943"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The importance of consistency</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">The important thing is consistency. You can use quoted or ‘nominal’ cost of money rates to discount ‘actual money’ cash flows, as we did in evaluating the car project; or you can use ‘real’ cost of money rates to discount uninflated cash flows, that is cash flows at today’s prices. Whichever method is used there will, of course, be inconsistencies, because in any real situation not all prices will increase at the general inflation rate, even if we could estimate accurately what that would be. Bearing in mind that every figure in a financial case is itself an estimate, such inconsistencies are unlikely to destroy its validity.</span></p>

<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="box-text">The main points covered in this chapter, linked to its objectives, have been the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">‘Cash flow’ means the movement of cash to or from an individual, or into or out of an organisation.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">There are three possible approaches to setting out estimates of investment cash flows. They are:</span>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>the whole project approach, suitable in complex situations or where more than two alternatives are to be considered;</li>
<li>the combined approach;</li>
<li>the incremental approach.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="ul">
<p class="boxText"><span class="no-style-override-1">Of these, the incremental approach is usually the shortest, and the most informative, but it may be unsuitable for complex situations.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">The two main characteristics of cash flows that are relevant to the decision process are that they will occur in the future and that they differ among the alternatives being considered.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">The ‘real’ value of a cash flow depends on when it occurs. The further into the future, the less the cash flow’s real value in today’s terms. The way to determine this real value is to discount the cash flows, using a discount rate based on the individual’s or organisation’s cost of money.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">All money has a cost. This is true of both borrowed and ‘owned’ money. The cost of using owned money is the ‘opportunity cost’ – the benefit forgone by not investing it in the best available alternative.</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">Either discount ‘actual money’ cash flows using a quoted or ‘nominal’ discount rate, or discount uninflated cash flows using the equivalent ‘real’ discount rate. Compare like with like.</span></li>
