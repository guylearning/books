<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">Outsourcing is a complex subject with strategic, operational, legal and financial implications. The main purpose of this chapter is to shed some light on one aspect of it: the mechanics of its cost-justification and accounting at the level likely to be encountered by an IT decision maker who may not happen to be financially expert. It may also be of use to financial people for whom decisions about outsourcing are not an everyday occurrence. Wider aspects of the subject are treated in the books listed in ‘Further reading’.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-2">WHAT IS OUTSOURCING?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Outsourcing means different things to different people. A working definition of IT outsourcing is as follows: a contractual relationship for the provision and management of IT services by an external supplier, under which:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>the services are customised to the customer’s requirements, such that payment by the customer will be related to the achievement of agreed service levels and specified results;</li>
<li>the services may be carried out at the customer’s premises or at those of the supplier;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">the outsourcing may, and typically does, include the transfer of non-current assets and/or people from the customer to the supplier.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Whatever is being considered as a candidate for outsourcing, the fundamental questions are much the same:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Do we have the expertise and resources to do this effectively ourselves?</li>
<li>Even if we do, would having it done by an outside specialist organisation result in better service or be more economical by, for example, liberating resources for more productive work?</li>
<li class="bullet-last">If so, should we outsource the whole function or just parts of it, and if so, which parts?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Early examples of outsourcing</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Some examples of what could be called outsourcing, although it was not called that at the time, were to be found in the very early days of commercial computing, as far back as the 1960s. ‘Service bureaux’ offered either specific services, such as data entry, or specific applications, such as payroll, accounting and inventory control. These bureau services were offered both by IT manufacturers and by large IT user organisations as a way of earning revenue from spare capacity on the (then) very expensive IT equipment in which they had invested and from the expertise that they had acquired. Later, specialist companies were founded, often as subsidiaries of large commercial organisations, which offered specific services, IT maintenance chief among them.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">More recent developments in service provision</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Today, once again, IT manufacturers are among those offering outsourcing services, together with IT consultancies and other specialist companies. The services on offer cover the full spectrum, from individual applications to the provision and management of a customer’s total IT requirements.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Recent developments include innovations such as the computing grid and on-demand computing. The latest innovation is ‘cloud computing’, which has enabled the provision of computing services on a similar basis to a utility.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Cloud computing consists of the delivery of services, software and processing capacity over a network: either a public network (typically the internet) or a community or private network. The advent of cloud computing has in effect facilitated the process of IT outsourcing. Although the label ‘outsourcing’ is not always used, the provision of cloud computing services for an enterprise by an external provider is a perfect example of IT outsourcing. Services and resources are provided by a third party and a charge is levied on the basis of usage.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">The concept involves separation of the delivery of computing services to the end-user from the underlying technological infrastructure. Hence it offers all the classic advantages of outsourcing, such as allowing the enterprise to focus on its core business whilst relying on the expertise of an IT service provider for its computing needs. In addition, cloud computing offers significant additional benefits, notably increased efficiency with improved scalability and flexibility; these aspects allow greater responsiveness to the needs of the business, without the step-change increase in capital expenditure that purchase of the underlying assets would require.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-3">OUTSOURCING IN PERSONAL LIFE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">As with much of business life, an analogy with personal life will be useful, especially to those for whom outsourcing is an unfamiliar concept. We as individuals all use outsourcing. For example, while it is perfectly possible to do so, few people generate their own electricity. The means of doing so are not well understood by most people and to do so would in any case probably not be economical. Electricity generation comes outside our core ‘business’ of living, and we normally wish our limited time and resources to be spent on more productive things. So, most of us are content to let the power company do the job for us. They have the expertise and the money to invest in expensive equipment and keep it up to date, and they can achieve economies of scale that allow them to charge their customers affordable rates while still making a reasonable profit.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Some capital equipment (generating plant) is installed on supplier premises. Other equipment (a meter) is installed on customer premises. Both pieces of equipment are owned by the supplier and are therefore shown as assets on their statement of financial position. The depreciation of these assets is among the costs taken into account by the supplier when fixing its prices. These, and its other fixed costs, are usually recouped by means of a fixed quarterly charge to the customer, while the variable costs of actually generating electricity are recouped on a usage basis. Alternatively, all costs may be recouped by making a higher usage charge, with no standing charge.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The relationship between supplier and customer is governed by a contract, which contains penalty clauses for non-provision of service by the supplier or non-payment by the customer. Subject to the adjustments below, payments made by the customer are regarded as revenue in the hands of the supplier and as ‘revenue expense’ by the customer. In the books of the supplier at its accounting date, amounts due but not yet paid for electricity supplied are treated as receivables; any standing charges received in advance are treated as deferred revenue. In the ‘books’ of the customer the reverse is the case. The cost of electricity used but not yet paid for is a payable; any standing charges paid in advance are treated as prepayments.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Provided that we are prepared to accept certain reasonable constraints imposed by the supplier (for example, a particular voltage, standard interfaces for ‘plugging in’ and so on), then electricity can be regarded as a utility, which we use when we need it and for which we pay mainly for the amount used. Water and other utilities could provide similar analogies.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In summary, the reasons why we as individuals typically outsource our requirement for electricity and other utilities, are the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>They are necessary things, but they are peripheral to our core ‘business’ of living.</li>
<li>We have better things to do with our limited time and resources.</li>
<li>We may not have the expertise to provide them ourselves.</li>
<li>Because it is the core business of the supplier, for which they have both the infrastructure and the expertise, they can almost certainly provide it more cost-effectively and efficiently than we could.</li>
<li>We can benefit from improving technology without having to learn about, acquire and finance it ourselves.</li>
<li>We can ‘smooth’ our cash outflow because we do not have to bear the heavy upfront cost of the necessary equipment ourselves. By outsourcing, we are converting capital cost into revenue expense. ‘Smoothing’ simply means spreading the payment for goods or services over time.</li>
<li>We can reasonably expect higher availability.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Outsourcing helps us manage risk. If the supply fails, then because of contractual obligations the supplier is motivated to restore it quickly. If our own personal generator should fail, then what? Doing it ourselves is not a risk-free option.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-4">OUTSOURCING IN BUSINESS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Businesses also outsource their electricity requirements, although they sometimes provide their own in-house back-up generators to cover critical situations, as do some individuals. The numbers are bigger, but the same principles apply. For most, outsourcing is the obvious thing to do for a function such as power supply, which is not part of their core business. However, for some years now many other business activities have also come under that heading: for example, office cleaning, payroll, accounting, secretarial services, transport, equipment maintenance&amp; and IT.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The reasons, given above, why we as individuals outsource are the same reasons why businesses often do so, with one important addition. Most individuals do not draw up a personal statement of financial position and income statement, although we could and would find it a useful thing to do in pursuit of that most elusive of personal skills – keeping our financial affairs in order. Businesses, by contrast, are required to do so, both by commercial law and tax law.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">However, as will be discussed in <a href="24_FinanceforIT_chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, many businesses like to show a lean and mean statement of financial position with as few assets as possible. The fewer the assets, the less the ‘capital employed’ (money, to you and me) needed to finance them. The less the capital employed, the more impressive will be the return on capital employed: that key ratio that compares the profit earned with the money used to earn it. In <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> we saw how leasing can be one way of getting assets ‘off the books’, by paying to use assets that belong to someone else. Outsourcing can have a similar effect.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-5">FINANCIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF OUTSOURCING</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Whether or not to outsource is a big decision for an organisation and large amounts of money are usually involved. From a financial point of view, most of the big decisions that organisations make are usually regarded as ‘investment decisions’. They involve the investment of often large amounts of money and the expectation of an eventual ‘return’, sufficient in percentage terms to justify the investment. Whether to keep the old car or buy a less old one (see <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>) was an investment decision, albeit a rather small one. Whether to undertake the proposed new IT applications in Example 4.1 of <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> was another.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Service contracts are not like that, however, and outsourcing contracts are essentially service contracts. Think of one of the simpler kinds of IT service contract: maintenance. Suppose that under your current IT maintenance contract you would be spending CU100k per year for the next five years. Now suppose that an alternative supplier has offered to do the same job for CU80k per year for an equivalent level of service. Here, there is no upfront ‘investment’; indeed, the first payment in this example would be less (by CU20k) than it would otherwise have been, as would the remaining payments. Words such as ‘investment’ and ‘return’ have no applicability. The decision to be made here is not an ‘investment decision’ but a ‘cost reduction’ decision. The same is true of an outsourcing decision, regardless of which reasons were foremost for considering outsourcing in the first place and regardless of the fact that there may be substantial initial transition costs.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-6">RISK AND SERVICE LEVELS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">If outsourcing is indeed primarily a cost reduction decision, then it follows that the methods to be adopted for evaluating both the risk and the financial case will be those appropriate to cost reduction decisions. For a straight ‘cost reduction’ proposal like the one for cheaper maintenance outlined above, I suggest that the basis for decision would, in plain English, be:</span></p>
<div class="box">
<p class="boxText">Is the expected total saving over the duration of the contract big enough in proportion to the total ‘status quo’ expenditure to more than cover the risk of changing from the devil we know to one that we don’t know?</p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Continuing the maintenance contract example, provided only that the level of service from the new provider would indeed be at least equivalent to that provided by the old one, then would the expected total cost savings of CU100k (CU20k per year for five years) on current total costs of CU500k, a reduction of 20 per cent, be regarded as worthwhile? The answer would almost certainly be yes. The risk would be managed by ensuring that agreed service levels were specified in the contract or in a separate service level agreement, together with penalties for failure to meet them. It may be considerably easier to manage risk when someone else is doing the work and is contractually liable for it than when you are doing it yourself.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Now suppose that the total cost savings over the five-year period were expected to be not CU100k but CU5k (CU1k per year) on current total costs of CU500k, a reduction of only one per cent in total costs rather than the 20 per cent just considered. Would it be worthwhile to change suppliers for such a saving? The answer would almost certainly be no. In either case the decision would be based on the commercial judgement of the decision maker.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-7">FINANCIAL EVALUATION METHODS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Where there is no ‘investment’ and therefore no ‘return’ on investment it would be inappropriate to apply investment evaluation methods such as return on investment (ROI), internal rate of return (IRR) or payback, whose very names suggest their inapplicability. This applies to simple maintenance contracts; it applies equally to outsourcing proposals, however much bigger and more complex they may be.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Service suppliers such as maintenance contractors usually offer a discounted one-time payment as an alternative to monthly or other periodic payments. These offers are usually made attractive to customers because suppliers want both to get cash upfront and lessen the risk of customers walking away in mid-contract. So the discount is usually substantial and the option usually gives customers price protection for the duration of the contract. However, just because such offers involve a large upfront payment, that payment does not of itself convert a cost reduction decision into an investment decision. What it does is oblige the customer to make an additional financing decision, which would involve the use of net present value (NPV) to determine the real value of the discount being offered compared with making regular periodic payments.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Conversely, leasing is a way of smoothing the large initial investments necessary in many IT and other projects. However, leasing does not of itself convert an investment decision into a cost reduction decision just because it has the effect of removing the large upfront payment. What it also does is oblige the customer to make an additional financing decision to determine the real value of leasing compared with paying the lump sum.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">I repeat that whatever may have been the main reasons for considering outsourcing in the first place, however big and complex the proposal may be, and regardless of whether the outsourcing charges are smoothed or unsmoothed, the financial decision to be made is essentially a cost reduction decision and not an investment decision. It follows that the method used to evaluate outsourcing proposals will nearly always be the rather simple one illustrated above in the context of the maintenance contract and that the methods developed for evaluating investment decisions (ROI, IRR, NPV, payback) will usually not be applied.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">To the extent that a substantial upfront payment may be required by an outsourcing supplier, a financial case for outsourcing may well look like a case for an ‘investment decision’, and if being processed by spreadsheet or other computer model, then the arithmetic of all the above-named evaluation methods may well be done anyway, because such spreadsheets are usually designed with payback, NPV, IRR and ROI calculations built in. Needless to say, spreadsheets do not understand the significance or otherwise of the numbers that they produce. However, people evaluating outsourcing proposals will usually pay them scant regard or ignore them altogether, concentrating, as illustrated above, on the proportion of total estimated saving to total estimated status quo cost.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In the past, outsourcing suppliers have sometimes presented their proposals already smoothed. Although financing would almost always have been used to achieve this, the financing may not always have been obvious to the customer. However, it is now most likely that the ‘natural’ and the ‘smoothed’ cash flows would be shown separately. In the wake of several high-profile financial scandals in recent years, the financial regulatory environment is undergoing a process of radical change. Legislation designed to prevent fraudulent accounting and to make corporate executives more accountable for the accuracy of accounts and other information produced by their companies and corporations has been passed in some countries. An example was the <span class="italic">Sarbanes-Oxley Act</span> of 2002 in the USA. In the light of even more recent events in some countries further legislation can no doubt be expected.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-8">SERVICE ENHANCEMENTS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Another way in which an outsourcing decision may differ financially from many other big IT decisions is that, inherent in the nature of outsourcing (the partial or complete taking over of IT operations and management by an outside specialist organisation) is the likelihood that it might per se result in service enhancements. Examples might include higher availability or faster response times, and a resulting increase in productivity. Once a customer becomes convinced of the likelihood of such enhancements, the enhancements themselves might then become a further factor in favour of outsourcing. This might be thought to be a wholly benign cycle. However, an attendant difficulty is in deciding how to take the inherent enhancements into account in the financial case and the decision process.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">A reasonable approach might be to recognise that two quite different things are happening when considering a typical outsourcing proposal – a like-for-like transfer of function and an enhancement of function – and treat them as the subjects of two different decisions. However, in practice it can be difficult to differentiate the two things for reasons that will become apparent shortly. In this respect, relevant considerations for the customer include the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>If the enhancements inherent in the outsourcing proposal will bring quantifiable benefits, then the amount of the benefits should be included in the financial case for outsourcing.</li>
<li>If not, then they should be ignored. However, a supplier would no doubt resist strongly any suggestion by the customer that they (the supplier) should somehow remove the enhancements and reduce the price correspondingly.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">If the enhancements are sufficiently desirable to be contemplated even if the status quo were to continue, and if it would be both technically and economically feasible to provide them in-house, then both the benefits and the additional costs of providing them should be estimated and built into the in-house financial case, so that like is being compared with like.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The second bullet point above illustrates the main difficulty that inherent enhancements can cause the decision maker in practice. The point is that the enhancements usually come with the deal, regardless of whether customers want them or not. That said, customers are usually happy to accept them.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">As an analogy, imagine that you have bought and paid for a new washing machine. Subsequently, the salesperson discovers that the model that you have bought is no longer available from the manufacturer and offers you at no extra cost a new, enhanced model. You would almost certainly accept the offer, even if you didn’t particularly want or need the enhancements. What would almost certainly be futile would be to ask for them to be removed and for a corresponding reduction in price. If the new model was only available at a higher price, then you would evaluate the benefits to determine whether the higher price was worth paying.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The course most often adopted is to attempt to identify and quantify the benefits, if any, expected to result from the enhancements. By summarising them into a single line it becomes a simple matter to evaluate the financial case both with and without the enhancements. In the example that follows, I have included the assumed benefits of enhanced service in the financial case for outsourcing, and have assumed that it would not be economically feasible to provide them in-house.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-9">INFLATION</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> it was pointed out that in producing financial cases people can and do use either inflated or uninflated values. For either approach, the starting point is to determine today’s uninflated values; then, if required, to identify those items that will be subject to inflation, choose an appropriate rate and calculate future amounts accordingly.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The question is this: in a ‘status quo versus outsourcing’ financial case is it equally appropriate to use inflated or uninflated values? The answer is no. Inflated values should be used, for the following reason. For the customer, outsourcing involves the effective taking over by the supplier of a large number of individual in-house cost items and their replacement by a single item, which is the outsourcing charge, usually over a period of between seven and 10 years. It is certain that the supplier, in setting its price, will take into account the expected inflation of its costs over the contract period. Not to do so would practically ensure a loss-making contract. If, therefore, the customer does not also take inflation into account in its financial case, then outsourcing charges, whether ‘smoothed’ or not, that have been arrived at after taking into account inflation will be being compared with uninflated in-house costs. Like will not be being compared with like.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Even at low rates of inflation the differences are not trivial. At the time of writing, 2012, inflation in many countries is quite low. For those future costs that do indeed increase at the rate of inflation, even such a low rate as three per cent will cause them to be 16 per cent higher after five years, and 34 per cent higher after 10. Imagine a higher rate of inflation, say seven per cent. After 10 years, increasing at seven per cent per year, a cost will have almost doubled. During the early 1990s inflation rates in many countries were substantially higher than seven per cent.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1"><span class="no-style-override-7">Remember that a typical outsourcing contract may run for 10 years, during which time there might be many changes in the economic environment. With that in mind, there are two ways in which suppliers typically take inflation into account in setting their charges. The first, and the most risky for the supplier but the most certain for the customer, is to make an estimate of average inflation over the whole contract period and inflate their expected costs accordingly in the process of calculating their charges. The second is to state, in the contract, charges for an initial period, together with a formula for applying some level of indexation thereafter that will compensate for inflation in accordance with a recognised index, such as an index of wages and salaries. Whatever the method employed it is of course ultimately a matter for agreement between supplier and customer. In the example that follows later in this chapter I shall, for simplicity, be assuming the first of these two methods.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-10">HOW TO BUILD AN OUTSOURCING FINANCIAL CASE</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">The main headings to which consideration would nearly always have to be given in an IT outsourcing decision are the following, although in practice there may of course be others. Under each heading is a brief checklist of the main points that will usually have to be considered in that context. All of these main points feature in the worked example that follows shortly and are explained in detail in the narrative commentary thereon.</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Hardware</span> – Trade-in or transfer values of existing hardware; purchase prices or lease payments for new; lease termination, extension or assignment charges; maintenance, power and insurance; (in profit and loss financial cases only) depreciation; and losses or profits on disposal.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Software</span> – Licence fees: lump sums or financing payments; annual maintenance charges; licence transfer fees; (in profit and loss cases only) amortisation; and losses on transfer or cessation of use.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Premises </span>– Sale price or rent of existing; purchase price or rent of new; any sub-rent receivable; and running costs.</li>
<li><span class="bold">People</span> – Salaries and overheads; redundancy payments; cost of people retained or hired for liaison with an outsourcing supplier; and outsourcing consultancy fees.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Administrative overheads</span> – If these will change as a result of outsourcing, then they should be included.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Service enhancements</span><span class="no-style-override-7"> – See the similarly titled section earlier in this chapter.</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">Outsourcing charges</span> – See the above explanations of ‘smoothing’ and the section entitled ‘Inflation’.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">To remind you, the golden rule for financial cases designed to assist decision-making is restated as follows:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>In cash flow financial cases, include future cash outflows and inflows that differ among the alternatives. Include cash paid and received in respect of purchase and sale of capital assets, but never their associated depreciation or losses or profits on disposal.</li>
<li>In profit and loss financial cases, include future expenses and revenues that differ among the alternatives. Include depreciation and losses or profits on disposal of capital assets, but never their associated cash flows.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Exclude sunk costs: costs already incurred that cannot be recouped.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="boxTextH">CHECKPOINT</p>
<p class="boxText2">So far in this chapter we have covered the first three of its five objectives. In particular:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have discussed what outsourcing is, with particular reference to IT, and the main reasons for considering it;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have discussed the particular financial characteristics of outsourcing and the financial implications of outsourcing decisions;</span></li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">we have listed the factors that typically have to be taken into account in building a financial case for outsourcing vis-à-vis in-house provision.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-11"><span class="no-style-override">A WORKED EXAMPLE</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">As with most of the topics in the book, this one will be further discussed in the context of a worked example. Especially if outsourcing is your particular interest, then this example is one from which you have much to gain by attempting to work through it yourself. Alternatively, you can simply read it as part of the narrative. The example is designed to illustrate in a simple and logical way as many as possible of the factors that frequently feature in decisions about whether the IT function should be outsourced or remain (or return) in-house. You are once again invited to accept any artificiality in the example as a price to pay for its being as comprehensive as possible and therefore a basis for building your own real and no doubt more complex cases.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The approach adopted will be to illustrate, with numbers, the financial factors (listed above) that need to be considered in a typical outsourcing decision, and in building an appropriate financial case in both cash flow and profit and loss form. In the narrative commentary that follows you will be taken step by step through every line of the solution. Except for anything blindingly obvious, each line will be described in the text and different options discussed where appropriate. I repeat that, even if you prefer to ignore the numbers, just reading the text will contribute significantly towards achieving the learning objectives of the chapter.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-12">EXAMPLE 10.1: DESCRIPTION</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">Assume that an organisation is considering whether to outsource its IT function. Management has considered the various arguments in favour of outsourcing and most of them seem to be applicable. Discussions are in progress with an IT outsourcing company, and some work has been done to collect data on the likely costs and benefits. Some organisations use the services offered by outsourcing consultants (see the section on ‘Managing the process’ at the end of this chapter), in which case it would be the consultants with whom the organisation would be dealing in these early stages. The organisation’s management recognises that seven to 10 years is a reasonable and typical period over which to contract for such a major change to their business. However, to avoid filling pages unnecessarily with numbers, I have chosen a shorter five-year evaluation period. In this example, for the sake of simplicity, just one outsourcing proposal is being compared with the in-house status quo. In practice, several competing proposals might be under consideration.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The input data</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">You will find the input data in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img158">Table 10.1</a>. In that table, items typically likely to be subject to inflation are marked with the letter ‘I’ in the ‘Ref’ column to the right of the numbers. Items that would be transferred to the outsourcing supplier are marked with a ‘T’. I suggest that you glance at <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img158">Table 10.1</a> now. However, should you wish to treat the example as an exercise and attempt it yourself, then before doing so:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(1) <span class="no-style-override-7">Read the following sections first, up to ‘Explanations’.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">(2) <span class="no-style-override-7"> Look ahead at <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img165">Tables 10.2</a>–<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img173">10.8</a> and either draw up rough versions of them or use simple spreadsheets on a computer for your workings.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">How to approach the task</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">There is no textbook way of approaching this task. No doubt for this very reason, each organisation has its own way of doing things. What follows should help you to understand the principles involved sufficiently to be able to relate them to your particular organisation’s way of doing things. To guide you through the almost certain differences, and hopefully to minimise any annoyance at not finding your particular approach faithfully reproduced, here are a few general comments:</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img id="img158" src="images/img158.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="images" width="1452" height="1151"/></p>

<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>I have adopted the same style as for the other major worked example, in <a href="16_FinanceforIT_chapter04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>. In particular, I have tried to ensure that even if you wish to ignore the numbers you can still read the example as narrative.</li>
<li>You will recognise the following tables, although they cover five years rather than the four that you have become used to.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">I have maintained the convention of showing both cash outflows and expenses as negative numbers, while showing cash inflows and revenues as positive unsigned numbers. I have done this for clarity and the avoidance of confusion, although in practice many organisations omit the minus signs in printed output.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Throughout the book I have made the point that, in theory, cash flow is by far the most important way of mathematically evaluating investment opportunities, and have given reasons why this is so. However, we have also discussed the fact that decisions about outsourcing are not investment decisions but cost reduction decisions, and in practice these are often based primarily on their effect on profit or loss, rather than cash flow.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Even where investment decisions are being made, especially in large departmentalised organisations, it is important to know what the profit and loss effect of an investment will be, both for the organisation as a whole and for affected individual departments. This is not least because departmental performance is usually measured in profit and loss terms and because that performance is often the basis for awarding bonus and incentive payments. These practical realities sometimes result in decisions being made primarily with reference to the profit and loss effect and only secondarily or not at all on the basis of cash flow.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Therefore, here also I shall follow the practice in the earlier example of looking at the financial case in both cash flow and profit and loss terms, leaving you, the reader, to take from it whatever is relevant for your particular purpose. One practical reason for analysing both cash flow and profit and loss effects, especially with respect to capital expenditure, is that until you have estimated the cash flows you cannot work out what the impact on profit or loss will be.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">The ‘whole project’ approach</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">For this example, and for large financial cases in general, it will be found that the ‘whole project’ method of setting out financial cases is the most convenient to adopt. This was explained in <a href="14_FinanceforIT_chapter02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, but briefly to recap, it involves:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>listing all the costs and income associated with the status quo;</li>
<li class="bullet-first bullet-first-override-2"><span class="no-style-override-7">listing all the costs and income associated with the proposal for change;</span></li>
<li class="bullet-first bullet-first-override-2"><span class="no-style-override-7">comparing the respective totals to determine the savings.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-13">STEP BY STEP TO THE SOLUTION</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Based on the above, the step-by-step approach followed in this example is as follows, each step following logically from the preceding one:</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">(1) Estimate what the relevant cash outflows and inflows would be in today’s values over the chosen evaluation period if the status quo, in this case in-house operation, were to be maintained throughout the period. This includes estimating the likely timing, costs and financing methods of expected changes to equipment, software, people, premises and overheads likely to be necessary, and any proceeds of disposal.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">(2) Identify those cash flows likely to rise, at least approximately, in line with expected inflation.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">(3) Recalculate the numbers listed in (1), incorporating inflated values where appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">(4) Estimate the relevant cash flows for the ‘inflated’ outsourcing proposal, using inflated values where appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">(5) Compare the respective totals in (3) and (4) to determine the estimated net cash flow savings.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">(6) Repeat steps (3) to (5) above, substituting expenses and revenues for cash outflows and inflows, in order to determine the estimated net expense savings.</span></p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-14">THE TABLES</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Following, in the sequence in which they are first referred to, are seven tables, to which reference will be made in the narrative. The case for using inflated values has been made above. However, the point is also illustrated in the tables listed below. <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img165">Table 10.2</a> includes only uninflated cash flows; in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a> those cash flows likely to increase with inflation (marked with an ‘I’) have been inflated at a rate of three per cent per annum from the year following that in which they first occur. All subsequent tables in the example, whether cash flow or expense, are derived from the inflated numbers in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Tables showing cash outflows and inflows</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="bold"><a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img165">Table 10.2</a></span> – The in-house status quo, in detail and including the currently intended likely developments over the next five years, looked at from a cash flow viewpoint, all at today’s (uninflated) values.</li>
<li><span class="bold"><a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a></span> – As <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img165">Table 10.2</a>, but reworked to include inflation as appropriate.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Tables showing expenses and revenues</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>

</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Supplementary tables</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">The following two additional tables list the differences between the ‘cash flow’ and ‘expense’ tables of the status quo and outsourcing situations respectively. They are included here only as aids to understanding and do not form part of the financial case.</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="bold"><a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img174">Table 10.9</a></span> – Lists the differences between the net cash flows (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a>) and net expenses (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a>) of the ‘status quo’ situation.</li>
<li class="bullet-last"><span class="bold"><a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img175">Table 10.10</a> </span>– Lists the differences between the net cash flows (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img167-2">Table 10.4</a>) and net expenses (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img171">Table 10.7</a>) of the outsourcing proposal.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">A quick tour of the tables</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">I suggest that you now take a quick first look at the tables. They may look a bit daunting because there are so many numbers, but do not be put off by this. We shall be going through the logic of each one a line at a time, step by step. And remember if you prefer to ignore the numbers, then do so and just continue reading the narrative.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Note that even those tables that concern cash flows do not contain a ‘Year 0’ column. The reason why this is so concerns financial evaluation methods (see above), and the fact that outsourcing, whatever the main reasons for considering it, is regarded from a financial viewpoint as a cost reduction decision, not an investment decision. Because of this, methods that are designed to evaluate investment decisions are not appropriate and are therefore generally not used. In fact, net present value (NPV) could be used, because it can be applied to any set of cash flows. However, the practice is usually not to do so. We shall shortly be looking at all the tables in detail. However, for now just look at three of them:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="bold"><a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a></span> – Status quo – cash flows as currently intended, inflated at three per cent where relevant;</li>
<li><span class="bold"><a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a> </span>– Status quo – expenses as currently intended, inflated at three per cent where relevant;</li>
<li class="bullet-last"><span class="bold"><a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img174">Table 10.9</a></span> – Status quo – reconciliation between <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a> (cash flows) and <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a> (expenses).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Note the differences between them. To help you, items that differ between <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Tables 10.3</a> and <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">10.6</a> are shown in italics. You will note that the total net expense in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a> (CU16,514k) is substantially different from the total net cash outflow in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a> (CU13,924k). This is due entirely to the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-7"><a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a> (cash flows) includes the purchase price of capital equipment, software and premises, and any proceeds of sale, trade-in or transfer, while depreciation and losses or profits on disposal are ignored because they are not cash items.</span></li>
<li class="bullet-last">In <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a> (expenses) the reverse is true; cash costs and cash proceeds of disposal of non-current assets are ignored, because they do not directly affect the profit or loss. However, all depreciation, amortisation and losses on disposal are included. <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img174">Table 10.9</a> lists all these differences and reconciles the totals of the two tables.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In a real situation there may be other differences between <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Tables 10.3</a> and <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">10.6</a>. These would mostly be timing differences arising from revenues being earned before cash is received and expenses being incurred on credit before cash is paid. However, in financial cases such differences are often trivial and even if not they tend to be ignored. For all revenue and expense items in this example it will be assumed that there are no timing differences, by which I mean that cash is received at the same time as revenue is earned and that cash is paid at the same time as costs are incurred.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-15">EXAMPLE 10.1: EXPLANATIONS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The following commentary explains individual lines in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img165">Tables 10.2</a>–<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-1">10.5</a>. Not all items call for comment. Where a similar item has already been the subject of comment earlier, either in this or in earlier examples, there may be a brief comment together with a reference back to the original one. However, you will be guided every step of the way.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Status quo – cash flows as currently intended, uninflated (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img165">Table 10.2</a>)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">All the numbers in this table are at today’s values, that is uninflated, as this would usually be the starting point for any financial case. As already discussed, however, to use uninflated values in an outsourcing financial case would not be comparing like with like, as the outsourcing supplier’s charges would have been calculated taking expected inflation into account. <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a> is a repeat of <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img165">Table 10.2</a>, but showing inflated values for all items to which inflation is likely to apply. For clarity, these items have been marked with the letter ‘I’. All subsequent tables are derived from the numbers in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a>. The commentary on <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a> is equally applicable to <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img165">Table 10.2</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Status quo – cash flows as currently intended, inflated at three per cent where relevant (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a>)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In this table, items shown in italics are those that differ between <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Tables 10.3</a> and <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">10.6</a> (and, later, between <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img167-2">Tables 10.4</a> and <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img171">10.7</a>).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Mainframes, midrange and peripherals (owned)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">In this table we are making estimates of the expected future cash flows of the status quo (stay-as-we-are) situation. The pieces of information relevant for this purpose are:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>the cash inflow in Year 2 of CU200k representing the expected proceeds of sale of the existing equipment;</li>
<li>the cash outflow of CU1,600k, also in Year 2, representing the expected purchase price of its replacement;</li>
<li class="bullet-last">the estimated cash outflows on maintenance, power and insurance on both the existing and new equipment.</li>

<p class="paraNoIndent1">Book value, depreciation and any loss or profit on disposal do not represent cash flows and therefore have no place here. They will be important when, in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a>, we come to consider the status quo in profit and loss terms of expenses and revenues. Trade-in is usually done at market value, although there can sometimes be exceptions (see the later comments in the context of <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img171">Table 10.7</a>).</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Maintenance, power, insurance</span> – These are relevant cash flows. They are also expenses and will therefore also appear in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a>. This is the first example of cash flows likely to be subject to inflation-related increases.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Software licences</span> – Although intangible, software licences are usually treated for accounting purposes just like any other non-current asset. They are initially shown on the licensee’s books at cost. Whether the licences are for finite periods or are of indeterminate length for as long as maintenance charges are paid, they are depreciated over their expected useful lives, except that the word ‘amortisation’ is usually applied to the depreciation of intangible assets. These licences had obviously been purchased before the start of our evaluation period. Therefore, neither the purchase price, which is a ‘sunk cost’, nor the amortisation, which is not a cash flow, are relevant for this table of cash flows. The transfer fee is of course ignored in this ‘status quo’ table, but will be included in both <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img167-2">Tables 10.4</a> and <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img171">10.7</a>, which concern the outsourcing cash flows and expenses respectively.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Software annual maintenance</span><span class="no-style-override-7"> – These are payments to cover fixes, new releases and often new versions also, although sometimes an additional charge will be made for a new version. Annual maintenance charges are relevant cash flows and are therefore included. Like hardware maintenance, they are also expenses and will therefore appear in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a> as well. As with equipment maintenance, above, it has been assumed that these payments and all similar ones in this example are not fixed and are therefore subject to inflation-related increases.</span></li>
<li class="bullet-last"><span class="bold">External net revenue</span> – A plausible source of attributable revenue, expected to continue throughout the evaluation period if the status quo is maintained, has been deliberately included as an illustration of ‘opportunity cost’, although it is recognised that it may not feature in many outsourcing decisions. The opportunity cost in this case would be the revenue forgone if the decision is taken to outsource.</li>

<p class="paraNoIndent2">Mainframes, midrange and peripherals (operating leased)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Operating leases can be thought of as being like rental (i.e. paying for the use of assets that belong to someone else). The lease payments, assumed to be fixed, are treated both as cash outflows (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a>) and as expenses (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a>). Operating leases usually, as assumed here, include the option to return leased assets to the lessor at the end of the primary term of the lease (see <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Maintenance, power and insurance</span> – Leases of all kinds usually require the lessee to maintain and insure the leased assets.</li>
<li class="bullet-last"><span class="bold">Software licences</span> – In this example a single lump sum licence payment is assumed. However, especially when a software licence is part of a bigger acquisition including hardware or services, it could be financed, together with the other elements acquired, so that payment for everything could be spread over time. The instrument for financing a software licence would usually be a finance lease, although if it is wrapped up in a larger deal this fact may be transparent to the customer. As with the other software licences, referred to above, book value, amortisation and the loss on cessation of use are irrelevant for this table of cash flows.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">PCs – desktops and laptops</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These PCs were obviously purchased before Year 1. Therefore, the cash outflow representing their purchase price is a ‘sunk cost’ and ignored in the cash flow financial case; their depreciation is ignored because it is not a cash item. The only relevant capital cash flow would be any expected future proceeds of sale or trade in. In this case, that figure is assumed to be nil. The relevant ‘revenue expense’ cash flows for the new PCs are the lease payments and the payments for maintenance etc. Like all the revenue and ‘revenue cost’ cash flows, they will also appear in the profit and loss financial case (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a>).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Premises (owned)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Once again, no capital cash flows are shown because:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>the purchase price was a pre-evaluation sunk cost; and</li>
<li class="bullet-last">depreciation is not a cash item.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The cash flows representing the running costs are included in both the cash flow and profit and loss financial cases.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Premises (rented)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">The future rent and running costs are shown both here as cash outflows and, in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a>, as expenses. The rent is stated to be fixed; the running costs are assumed to be subject to inflation.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent2">People</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">People costs are both cash outflows and, ignoring timing differences, expenses.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Regarding people, brief mention should be made of employment protection regulations. In some countries there are regulations that are designed to protect the rights of people in certain situations. These are situations, including outsourcing, in which employees of one organisation (in this case the customer) are transferred to the employment of another (the outsourcing supplier), or vice versa if a previously outsourced function is being moved back in-house. These rules typically impose obligations to consult with affected staff and protect their terms and conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Administrative overheads</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These are all assumed to be cash outflows subject to inflation and, in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a>, as expenses. In a real situation, these totals might include the depreciation of assets, for example buildings and IT systems used for administrative purposes. If that were so, then the amounts of such depreciation would be excluded from this cash flow table, but would be included in the profit and loss version (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-2">Table 10.6</a>).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Status quo – total net cash flows</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This line shows the total estimated net cash outflows (CU13,924k) expected to result from a decision to continue with the in-house situation, and the years in which they would occur. <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img167-2">Table 10.4</a>, which we shall consider shortly, contains the equivalent for the outsourcing situation. <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-1">Table 10.5</a> will compare the two sets of totals, this comparison being an important part of the eventual decision process.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Outsourcing – cash flows, inflated at three per cent where relevant (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img167-2">Table 10.4</a>)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This table is similar to <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a>, but instead of reflecting the status quo cash flows it shows the expected relevant cash inflows and outflows that would occur if the outsourcing proposal were to be accepted and if cutover were to take place at the beginning of Year 1. For ease of eventual comparison, this table has much the same format as <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img166">Table 10.3</a>. However, many of the lines contain no numbers, because they represent items of cost that would be taken over by the supplier and are consequently now included in the supplier’s outsourcing charges. Empty lines are not referred to in the following commentary.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Outsourcing charges</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Outsourcing contracts always involve substantial initial costs, often called transition costs. This means that, as with many kinds of long-term contract, the supplier’s costs are ‘front-loaded’, and would ideally be recouped from the customer as and when they are incurred. However, from the customer’s point of view, the value of the service received would normally be much the same in the first year of the contract as in the last, so customers would like the payment pattern to reflect that fact.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">The usual solution to these conflicting requirements will be familiar to those who have read <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> on leasing or who already understand its principles. One of the many reasons why organisations use leasing is to spread, or smooth, the initial payment for long-term IT or other assets over the period that will benefit from their use. Outsourcing is a long-term service, and you cannot lease a service. What you can do, however, is to use financing to smooth the payments to be made by the customer, while at the same time ensuring that the supplier gets paid the full amounts on the due dates.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Some outsourcing suppliers have their own subsidiary finance companies and will offer smoothing as a service to their customers. Those that do not will usually suggest a selection of third party finance companies from which the customer can choose a financing partner. In either case, the finance company will offer a payment stream tailored to meet the needs of the customer. This may be a smoothed stream of regular payments or, as with leasing, it may be a series of irregular payments including, for example, holidays or step payments to accommodate the cyclical nature of a particular customer’s business or some other circumstance such as a temporary shortage of cash.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Reverting to the present example, there are in theory two different decisions to be made here. The first is what, in the context of outsourcing, I have called the ‘cost reduction decision’; the second is the financing decision. You may recall from <a href="21_FinanceforIT_chapter09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> that a financing decision is usually based on a net present value (NPV) calculation, using as a discount rate the customer’s current cost of incremental borrowing from their normal source, typically a bank. You may also recall from earlier in this chapter that, nowadays, suppliers would typically quote both smoothed and unsmoothed payment streams. Here, for the sake of simplicity, I have taken a shortcut, ignored both the ‘natural’ payment stream and the financing decision, and used the smoothed payment stream proposed by the supplier.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent2">Mainframes, midrange and peripherals (owned)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Note that the relevant cash flow of CU400k represents the price to be paid by the supplier to acquire the equipment from the customer. In theory, this need not be paid in cash but could be taken into account in working out the outsourcing charges. However, in practice it is nearly always done as a cash transaction, because a large injection of cash at the start of the contract is often a major incentive for customers to undertake outsourcing. The transaction would usually be done at a price equal or close to market value. Reasons why it might possibly be done at a higher price will be mentioned later in the context of <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img171">Table 10.7</a>.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent2">Comparison of inflated ‘status quo’ and ‘outsourcing’ cash flows (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-1">Table 10.5</a>)</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This table represents the summary cash flow financial case. It is a comparison of the estimated net cash flows of both scenarios: outsourcing and the status quo in cash flow terms. Subtracting the outsourcing cash flows from those of the ‘status quo’ situation gives the net reduction in cash outflows that would result from a decision to implement outsourcing from the beginning of Year 1. The total net reduction in cash outflow of CU5,951k represents approximately 43 per cent of the status quo cash flows of CU13,924k. This might typically be thought, at first glance, to be a good margin in favour of outsourcing. However, note that three quarters of that reduction actually comes from Years 1 and 2, with their various distortions due to the disposal and acquisition of assets. When, from Year 3 onwards a more or less steady state is reached in the comparison between the two scenarios, the net reduction in cash outflow drops to an average of approximately 20 per cent of the status quo cash flows. This might still be regarded as attractive by many organisations. It is always desirable to look at the year-by-year numbers, as we have just done, as well as at the totals, because there will always be similar distortions in the early years, although they may be less pronounced than they are in this contrived example.</p>

<li class="bullet-first bullet-first-override"><span class="bold">Existing equipment – loss on transfer –</span><span class="no-style-override-7"> The loss on transfer of the equipment to the supplier in Year 1 of CU1,100k is the difference between the book value (CU1,500k) and the market value (CU400k). As described in <a href="20_FinanceforIT_chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, loss on disposal (or transfer) of assets is a perennial problem for organisations that buy IT and other high technology assets rather than, for example, lease them through operating leases. Human nature is understandably reluctant to admit that a very expensive asset just purchased, which is unlikely to wear out for many years, will nevertheless have a useful life of only, say, three years, even though that life may be prolonged by upgrades. As a result, estimates of useful life are often exaggerated. Consequently, on disposal by whatever means, book values of such assets often exceed their market values by substantial amounts. The resulting loss is a charge against profit, which, if sufficiently large, can cause company or departmental management to cancel or postpone an otherwise cost-effective proposal.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A">A possible way of eliminating the loss in this example might be for the customer to retain ownership of the equipment, at the same time granting a licence to the supplier to operate and maintain it. However, among the implications of doing so would be the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>The book value of CU1,500k would still eventually be a charge against profit, but via the mechanism of depreciation and spread over three years.</li>
<li>The customer would forego the cash inflow of CU400k, which would otherwise have been paid by the supplier. This might be much needed and may have been a significant reason for contemplating outsourcing in the first place.</li>
<li>The situation regarding software licences and transfer charges would have to be examined very carefully. See relevant books listed in <span class="no-style-override-7">‘Further reading’</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">A theoretical alternative might be for the supplier to agree to transfer the equipment at its book value, either directly or through a leasing company, thus eliminating the loss at the time of transfer, or at a lower figure that would at least reduce the loss. However, as already mentioned in <a href="20_FinanceforIT_chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, among the implications of doing this would be the following:</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li><span class="no-style-override-7">To the extent of any significant uplift in transfer price above market value, the transaction becomes an artificial transaction, with accounting, tax and legal implications for the customer, the supplier and any finance company involved. The safest course is not to do it, but if it is contemplated, then professional advice should be sought.</span></li>
<li>Even if it were to be done, then the supplier would need to recoup the excess of the transfer price over the market value in its outsourcing charge to the customer. In doing so, the supplier would apply its normal profit uplift, so that the customer would ultimately pay substantially more than the amount of the loss avoided.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1A"><span class="no-style-override-7">Decline in the value of most assets is a fact of life and cannot be wished away. If inadequate depreciation is written off during an asset’s life, then the inevitable effect will be a corresponding so-called ‘loss on disposal’: the difference between book value and market value. This difference is the resultant of three things:</span></p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>The rapid decline in market value of high technology assets generally.</li>
<li>The period chosen as representing expected useful life.</li>
<li>The method of depreciation chosen.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="no-style-override-7">The economic characteristics of high technology assets are not going to change. Therefore, if it is wished to avoid, or lessen, loss on disposal problems in future, the choice is to adopt either more realistic estimates of useful life or a different method of accounting for depreciation. As discussed in <a href="20_FinanceforIT_chapter08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, the two main accounting methods used to reflect the depreciation of any non-current assets are (a) the ‘straight line’ method, and (b) the ‘reducing balance’ method, a theme that has several variations. In some countries, the straight-line method is the most widely used; in some other countries, the reducing balance methods are favoured, sometimes because they are similar to the tax rules for depreciation in those countries.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">To remind you, the most common ‘reducing balance’ method is to calculate the depreciation for each year as a percentage (for example, 50 per cent) of the asset’s book value at the beginning of that year. The effect of this is that the book value declines more rapidly in the first couple of years, thus reflecting more closely the typical decline in market value. The obvious advantage of this method, provided a sufficiently high percentage is applied, is the likelihood of a lower eventual loss on disposal, thus lessening the problem that gave rise to this discussion. Its main disadvantage, however, is precisely the resulting high charge for depreciation in Year 1, which may cause what could be an unacceptable reduction in both company and departmental profit in that year.</p>

They, or more accurately the rights that they confer, are shown as assets on the customer’s books and are then amortised over their expected useful lives. If a licence has been taken out for a finite period, then that may, but not necessarily, suggest its expected useful life. If the licence is not for a finite period, but is to run for as long as annual maintenance payments are made, then the useful life must be estimated and amortisation applied accordingly. On transfer, or otherwise on cessation of use, any remaining book value (CU250k in this case) represents a loss, an expense to be charged against both the company and, if appropriate, departmental profit, just like a loss on disposal or transfer of hardware assets.</span></li>

The total reduction in net expenses of CU4,951k represents 30 per cent of the status quo net expenses of CU16,514k. As with the cash flow financial case considered earlier, this might be thought a reasonable margin in favour of outsourcing.

<p class="paraNoIndent">Remember that this has been a contrived and artificial example. Nevertheless, it includes most of those financial and accounting factors that generally feature in outsourcing decisions. It has already been said that, subject to the need to look carefully at the year-by-year ‘steady state’ numbers and not just the totals, this particular outsourcing proposal as a whole might be regarded as reasonably attractive from a purely financial viewpoint. However, there are some aspects of it that could be show-stoppers in particular situations, especially bearing in mind that enhancement benefits of CU300k per annum have been attributed to the outsourcing case. It will be worth considering these potential show-stoppers and what, if anything, might be done to mitigate them. For the following discussion it will only be necessary to look at <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-1">Tables 10.5</a> and <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img173">10.8</a>.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Starting, literally, with a positive in <a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img169-1">Table 10.5</a>, the total of the reduction in net cash outflow of CU4,462k in Years 1 and 2 of course looks extremely attractive. However, for some organisations the steady state cash position, showing an average reduction in net cash outflows over Years 3, 4 and 5 of about 20 per cent, might be barely acceptable. In those circumstances, the organisation might look carefully at the enhancement benefits and rework the case excluding them. If this is done (table not shown), then the total percentage cost reduction in net cash outflow falls to 31 per cent, and in the steady state years (3, 4 and 5) it falls on average to six per cent. In these circumstances there would probably be pressure to be more cautious about the attributed value of the enhancements.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Turning to the profit and loss effect (<a href="22_FinanceforIT_chapter10.xhtml#img173">Table 10.8</a>) the situation is reversed. The steady state of Years 3, 4 and 5 shows an average reduction in net expenses of about 34 per cent, which might be regarded as satisfactory. However, the Year 1 increase of CU225k in net expense, and consequent reduction in profit, may be unacceptable, both from a company and departmental viewpoint. The major contributor to this increase is the loss on transfer, CU1,100k, relating to the existing mainframe and midrange equipment. In these circumstances the temptation to eliminate that increase by, for example, trying to negotiate a transfer price that is at least CU225k above market value might be considerable. I repeat my earlier comment that if this is contemplated, then professional advice should be sought.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">It might be thought that another way round the problem of an increase in net expense in Year 1 might be to negotiate an outsourcing payment that is CU225k lower in Year 1, compensated for by higher payments in Years 2 to 5. Unfortunately, the accounting rules state that in those circumstances, regardless of the payment pattern, if the annual value from the contract is to be more or less equal year by year, then the total outsourcing payments would in effect have to be ‘re-smoothed’ for the purpose of charging them as expenses to the income statement. The effect of this would of course be to nullify what it had been intended to achieve.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">That concludes the example. Its purpose has been to illustrate as many as possible of the factors that usually need to be considered in financial cases for outsourcing versus in-house IT operations, and to provide a basis for building such financial cases in real life.</p>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-17">OUTSOURCING DECISION CRITERIA</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This chapter has concentrated on one particular aspect of outsourcing: the mechanics of its cost-justification and accounting at the level likely to be encountered by an IT decision maker who may not happen to be financially expert. It may also have been of use to financial people for whom decisions about outsourcing are not an everyday occurrence.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In the early days of IT outsourcing, a challenge for suppliers was to convince prospective customers that the benefits of a contractual outsourcing relationship would outweigh the risks perceived to be inherent in losing direct control over the people providing IT services. Today, IT outsourcing is well-established and is adopted by organisations large and less large across all sectors of industry and commerce, and the public sector, and includes organisations for which IT is, as the jargon has it, ‘mission-critical’.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">As an example of benefit to the ‘less large’ organisation, cloud computing is particularly advantageous for small to medium enterprises that cannot justify the investment necessary to provide all their computing needs in-house, especially at times of peak usage. Larger companies may choose to use a combination of cloud computing (for standardised applications) with in-house IT services, the latter particularly for older ‘legacy’ applications essential to their business operations.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">For all its benefits, however, outsourcing is not compulsory, and indeed sometimes organisations decide to revert from outsourced to in-house provision. So let us conclude by revisiting the decision criteria. We first looked at them in the context of the analogy with outsourcing in personal life. Translated to the business world, and IT specifically, factors to consider when contemplating IT outsourcing include the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>For most organisations, IT, although vital, is peripheral to their core business.</li>
<li>Do we have better things to do with our limited time and resources?</li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-7">Do we have the expertise to do for ourselves all the IT things that we need to do?</span></li>
<li>Could a specialist supplier, which can be presumed to have the necessary infrastructure, expertise and experience, provide our IT more cost-effectively than we could?</li>
<li>Would we benefit from having access to continually improving technology without having to learn about, acquire and finance it ourselves?</li>
<li>Both outsourcing and operating leasing are ways of converting capital cost into revenue expense, of smoothing cash flows and taking assets off the books. If these are among our requirements, then what are the pros and cons of each approach for us?</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Availability is critical to us. Doing it ourselves is not a risk-free option. Equally, to what extent is an outside supplier able to ensure the service levels that we require?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="sectionTitle" id="ch10-18">MANAGING THE PROCESS</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Although the following points are not primarily financial, for the sake of completeness it may be helpful to summarise the things that have to be done during the process of evaluating and implementing outsourcing. They include the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Assessing the current IT situation and business environment.</li>
<li>Determining what is to be outsourced.</li>
<li>Setting objectives for the required outcomes, including service levels, availability and cost reduction criteria.</li>
<li>Issuing an Invitation To Tender to a number of chosen suppliers.</li>
<li>Managing the bid process.</li>
<li>Building and evaluating the financial cases.</li>
<li>Selecting a supplier.</li>
<li>Negotiating the outsourcing contract and, if separate, the service level contract.</li>
<li>Making a final decision on whether to proceed.</li>
<li>Managing the transition.</li>
<li>Monitoring implementation of the outsourced service.</li>
<li class="bullet-last">Managing the ongoing contractual relationship.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">Such a list of tasks can be a daunting prospect even for a large organisation. Although many organisations will typically have significant experience of procurement, some of it on a large scale, outsourcing can be much more complex and multifaceted than some other procurements. The long-term relationships involved in outsourcing contracts make it critical to get it right.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent1">In this context, mention should be made of IT outsourcing consultants, or IT sourcing consultants as they are sometimes known. These are specialist organisations that advise customers on outsourcing matters, put them in touch with potential suppliers and, typically, manage the process of supplier selection. They generally provide an objective comparison between suppliers on a like-for-like basis in order to assist the customer in the selection process and bring the benefits of experience gained in similar situations. They may also act in a liaison role between customer and supplier during the currency of the contract.</p>
<div class="box" id="ch10-19">
<p class="boxTextH">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="boxText2">The main points covered in this chapter, linked to its objectives, have been the following:</p>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>IT outsourcing is a contractual relationship for the provision and management of IT services by an external supplier, under which the services are customised to the customer’s requirements, such that payment by the customer will be related to the achievement of agreed service levels and specified results.</li>
<li>Among the characteristics of outsourcing that raise particular financial issues are (a) the fact that it involves cost reduction rather than investment, (b) the transfer of assets and people, and (c) service enhancements.</li>
<li>In the context of a structured example, we have encountered the factors that typically have to be taken into account in building a financial case for outsourcing vis-à-vis in-house provision.</li>
<li>We have constructed a financial case for outsourcing vis-à-vis in-house provision from given data.</li>
<li>We have discussed how financial cases for outsourcing are typically evaluated, and why investment evaluation methods such as internal rate of return (IRR) and return on investment (ROI) are usually inappropriate.</li>
