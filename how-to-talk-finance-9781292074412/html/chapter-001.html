  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H11"><span class="bold">Is it plus or minus?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT4">One of the most common questions when looking at financial figures is: ‘is it a plus or a minus?’. A key skill in being able to ‘read’ financial information is to be able to change the question to ‘is it an asset or liability?’ (if you are looking at the balance sheet) or ‘is it an income or expense?’ (if you are looking at the P&amp;L).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT5">Let’s look at an example. In the profit and loss account of a business, you will find income and expenses. These may be presented like this:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX21">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image11"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/t0002_01.png" height="68" width="146"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT6">Sometimes brackets are used instead of the minus sign (they are easier to spot):</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX22">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image12"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/t0002_02.png" height="68" width="151"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT7">However, a company may ignore the use of a minus sign or brackets, assuming that costs are obviously costs and do not need a minus sign at all:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX23">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image13"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/t0002_03.png" height="70" width="151"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT8">All of the above are ‘correct’ if (cosmetically) presented differently. Now look at the following figures:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX24">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image14"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/t0002_04.png" height="147" width="205"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT9"><a id="page3"></a>In this example, ‘other income’ has brackets around it – presenting the number as a negative. The £20 on the line above is a cost, so ‘other income’ is presented as a ‘negative cost’ – in effect, an income. Your ability to spot these concepts will improve with practice.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT10">When looking at the balance sheet, the same concept applies. Sometimes in the ‘assets’ section of a balance sheet, you will be presented with a ‘negative asset’ – which is, in fact, a liability. Similarly, a negative liability must be an asset.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT11">The first chapter of this book will introduce the concepts of income, costs, assets and liabilities, so if the above does not make total sense at this point, don’t worry too much. But you might like to revisit this section as you read through the book. The key is to try to start thinking in terms of income and costs or assets and liabilities, not in terms of plus and minus.</p>
</div>
<div id="div8">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H12"><span class="bold">What is a sole trader?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT12">Let us first consider an individual who works for himself and who we shall call Arthur. Irrespective of what he actually does, whether it is manufacturing goods, buying and selling or providing a service, he is known as a sole trader.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image15"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0003_01.png" height="361" width="288"/>
</div>
  <ul id="ul4">
<li id="li12">What sort of businesses do you think are sole traders?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div9">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H13"><span class="bold"><a id="page4"></a>What is a partnership?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT13">Now let us assume that Arthur decides to go into business with Becky. Becky also works for herself as a sole trader. They agree to pool the income that they receive, deduct any costs incurred, and share anything left over on an equitable or pre-agreed basis. They have formed what is known as a partnership.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image16"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0004_01.png" height="352" width="288"/>
</div>
  <ul id="ul5">
<li id="li13">Accountancy and law firms are often partnerships. Why do you think this is?</li>
<li id="li14">What other businesses can you think of that are partnerships?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div10">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H14"><span class="bold">What is a limited company?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT14">Rather than forming a partnership with Becky, Arthur might choose to set up a separate company with Ben, which they will decide to call A&amp;B Ltd. The main difference between Arthur and Becky working together in a partnership and Arthur and Ben working together for the company is that the company is a separate legal entity. What is the effect of separating the owners from the business? There is a ‘veil of incorporation’ that separates Arthur and Ben, as the owners, from the company itself. Ltd means ‘Limited’ – as in ‘limited liability’. This refers to the limited liability of Arthur and Ben as the shareholders.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image17"><a id="page5"></a><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0005_01.png" height="301" width="563"/>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT15">For example, if A&amp;B Ltd was to borrow £10,000 and not be able to repay the loan, then Arthur and Ben – as the shareholders – would not be personally liable for that debt. Their liability would be limited to the amount of their original investment, perhaps as little as £100 each.</p>
  <ul id="ul6">
<li id="li15">What other advantages can you think of for creating a limited company?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div11">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H15"><span class="bold">What is the role of the directors?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT16">So, Arthur and Ben have set up A&amp;B Ltd. They need someone to run the company, so they appoint a board of directors. Initially, they appoint themselves as directors, and thus A&amp;B Ltd becomes an owner-managed business. In effect, Arthur and Ben, as the <span class="bold">directors</span>, are now running the business on behalf of Arthur and Ben as the <span class="bold">owners</span>.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="pc5"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0005_02.png" height="264" width="657"/>
</div>
  <ul id="ul7">
<li id="li16">Every company must have at least one director as a minimum. What limits the maximum, do you think?</li>
  </ul>
<div id="div12">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H21"><span class="bold"><a id="page6"></a>Are the directors always the owners of a company?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT17">As the company grows, Arthur and Ben may need additional help in running the business. In this case they might ask Charlie and Diana to join them on the board.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image18"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0006_01.png" height="264" width="684"/>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT18">The company continues to grow, and becomes so successful that Arthur and Ben decide to retire from the day-to-day running of the business. They remain as the shareholders but are no longer directors. We now have a situation where the owners of the business (Arthur and Ben) are different from the managers of the business (Charlie and Diana).</p>
<ul id="ul8">
   <li id="li17">What sort of companies do you think will have the shareholders and the directors as the same people?</li>
   <li id="li18">For what sort of companies will the directors and the shareholders be different people?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="div13">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H16"><span class="bold">What are the statutory accounts?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT19">How do Arthur and Ben know how Charlie and Diana are performing in running A&amp;B Ltd? Each year Charlie and Diana are legally required to prepare the annual report and accounts and send the report to the shareholders – Arthur and Ben. It is the directors who prepare the annual report and accounts (also known as the statutory accounts, because they are a legal requirement) every year for the shareholders. In the UK, every single company must, by law, produce a set of statutory accounts – and they are available to the public at Companies House (see <span class="bold"><a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/">www.companieshouse.gov.uk</a></span>).</p>
  <ul id="ul9">
<li id="li19">What would be the implication of not having to prepare financial statements?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div14">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H17"><span class="bold"><a id="page7"></a>What is the role of the auditors?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT20">Each year Arthur and Ben receive the annual report and accounts from Charlie and Diana, detailing how A&amp;B Ltd has performed financially over the previous 12 months. How do Arthur and Ben rely on the figures contained in the report and ensure that Charlie and Diana are telling the truth? The answer is that the shareholders (Arthur and Ben) will appoint an independent auditor to check the figures on their behalf. The auditor is appointed by the shareholders to check the figures that are prepared by the directors. Note – the auditors are not responsible for preparing the accounts, only checking them!</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image19"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0007_01.png" height="443" width="662"/>
</div>
  <ul id="ul10">
<li id="li20">What might be the impact if it was the directors who appointed the auditors?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div15">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H18"><span class="bold">What is the difference between the executive and the non-executive directors?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT21">Ella and Fiona have joined Charlie and Diana on the board of A&amp;B Ltd. Charlie and Diana are executive directors, whereas Ella and Fiona are non-executive directors. So, what is the difference between the two roles?</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT22"><a id="page8"></a>As the board of directors, together they determine the overall strategic direction of the company. Charlie and Diana, as executive directors, are responsible for executing that strategy. They have day-to-day responsibility for the running of the business. Ella and Fiona, as the non-executive directors, are responsible for holding Charlie and Diana to account. Non-executive directors usually are individuals who have a wealth of business experience, work for a number of different companies on a part-time basis, and can act as a mentor for the full-time directors. But they are also there to ensure that the executives, Charlie and Diana, are running the business in the best interests of the shareholders, Arthur and Ben (who by now have retired to a private island). Corporate governance states that companies must also be run in the interests of the employees and suppliers, but the primary interests are those of the shareholders.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image110"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0008_01.png" height="348" width="679"/>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT23">As shareholders, Arthur and Ben do not have right of access to the boardroom (if you buy a share in BP then you cannot attend board meetings!). So, the non-executive directors are appointed by the shareholders to hold the executive directors to account and to ensure that the business is being run in the best interests of the shareholders. This is a little bit like your local school – the head teacher and his or her senior leadership team (head of English, head of Maths, etc.) are the executive and have day-to-day responsibility for running the school and they sit on the governing body. The representatives from the local community – perhaps the local church, representatives from the parent teachers association and others with an interest – are also on the governing body; <a id="page9"></a>they do not run the school, but act as friendly advisors to the executive, providing feedback and guidance, but, ultimately, ensuring that the school is run in the best interests of the children (and no one else, including pushy parents!).</p>

  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div16">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H19"><span class="bold">What are assets?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT24">A&amp;B Ltd has assets. These are things that are owned by the company, such as tables, chairs, computer equipment, cash and stock in the warehouse. Despite what you might have been told, members of staff are not assets. This is because members of staff are not owned by the business; they are, in fact, contracted to undertake work and are therefore treated as an expense.</p>

  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div17">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H110"><span class="bold">What are liabilities?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT25">A&amp;B Ltd also has liabilities. These are amounts owed by the company to third parties. Typically, the largest liabilities of a company will be any debts that it has and any amounts owed to suppliers that have not yet been paid.</p>
  <ul id="ul13">
<li class="LIST_LAST_PARA" id="li24">What sort of liabilities does your business have?</li>
  </ul>

<div id="div18">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H111"><span class="bold">What is liquidation?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT26">If A&amp;B Ltd was put into liquidation, the assets would be sold off and turned into cash. The first thing that the directors must do with that cash is pay off their liabilities – the debts, suppliers, staff and any other amounts owing. Any money left over is known as the net assets. That is, the assets, net of (or less) the liabilities of the business. What would the directors do with this money that is left over?</p>
  <ul id="ul14">
<li id="li25">When a company is put into receivership, it continues to trade. When a company is put into liquidation, it ceases to trade. Why do you think this distinction exists?</li>
<li id="li26">Can you think of a company that has been put into administration, but not into liquidation (often referred to as pre-pack in the UK or Chapter 11 in the USA)?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div19">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H112"><span class="bold"><a id="page12"></a>What are shareholders’ funds?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT27">The answer is that Charles and Diana would have to give the money left over back to Arthur and Ben, i.e. return the money to the shareholders. Thus the net assets of a business are also referred to as the shareholders’ funds – that is, the amount owed by the company to the shareholders. As it is an amount owed by the company, it is accounted for as a liability; it is not referred to as a liability because the company does not have to pay the amount back unless it goes into liquidation. However, it is treated as a liability in the accounts.</p>
<div id="div20">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H22"><span class="bold">What is the accounting equation?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT28">We are now introduced to the accounting equation:</p>
<p class="CHAP_CENTER" id="CHAP_CENTER1"><span class="bold">assets less liabilities = shareholders’ funds</span></p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT29">We can rearrange the above equation to show:</p>
<p class="CHAP_CENTER" id="CHAP_CENTER2"><span class="bold">assets = shareholders’ funds plus liabilities</span></p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT30">or</p>
<p class="CHAP_CENTER" id="CHAP_CENTER3"><span class="bold">assets less shareholders’ funds less liabilities = zero</span></p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT31">It is a zero-sum game. The assets of a business are always equal to the liabilities of the business. Thus, we are introduced to the balance sheet. The balance sheet is so known because it always balances. One side is always equal to the other.</p>
<ul id="ul15">
   <li id="li27">What do you think the accounting equation will look like for your business?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="div21">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H23"><span class="bold">What will we find in shareholders’ funds?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT32">We have shown that the shareholders’ funds is the amount that is left over after deducting liabilities owed to third parties from the assets of a business. However, it is not just the balancing figure, all transactions are specifically accounted for. So what are the two main things that make up<a id="page13"></a> the shareholders’ funds? What are the two main things that a company owes back to its shareholders?</p>
</div>
<div id="div22">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H24"><span class="bold">How is investment accounted for in shareholders’ funds?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT33">The first element of the shareholders’ funds of a business is the investment made by the shareholders. Because, if Arthur and Ben were to invest £50 each into A&amp;B Ltd, the business would show assets of £100 (i.e. the cash) and shareholders’ funds of £100 (i.e. the amount owed back to Arthur and Ben) and thus the balance sheet would continue to balance.</p>
</div>
<div id="div23">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H25"><span class="bold">How is retained profit accounted for in shareholders’ funds?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT34">The second element of the shareholders’ funds (of a business) is any profit that it has made and that has been reinvested back into the business on behalf of the shareholders. So, if A&amp;B Ltd took the £100 that was originally invested by Arthur and Ben, started trading and generated a profit of £50, it could do one of two things with that profit. The directors could decide to pay a dividend (which is a distribution of profit) to Arthur and Ben, or they could decide to reinvest it back into the business, or a combination of both.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT35">So, if A&amp;B Ltd generated a profit of £50 and paid £20 back to Arthur and Ben in the form of a dividend, then it would still owe the shareholders (Arthur and Ben) the £30 that was not paid back to them – this is in effect the retained profits (sometimes referred to as retained earnings) and would, therefore, appear as part of the shareholders’ funds on the balance sheet.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image114"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0013_01.png" height="176" width="451"/>
</div>
<ul id="ul16">
   <li id="li28">What do you think is the mix between these two elements of shareholders’ funds for your business?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="div24">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H113"><span class="bold"><a id="page14"></a>How do the profit &amp; loss account and balance sheet interact?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT36">Now that Arthur and Ben have set up A&amp;B Ltd, let us see how the company actually trades.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT37">Imagine that Arthur and Ben each invest £50 into A&amp;B Ltd. The assets of the business would be £100 in cash. At this point the company does not have any liabilities (amount that it owes to third parties) so the net assets of the company are £100. This £100 of net assets is represented by the shareholders’ funds, that is, the original investment of £100, plus any retained profits. As the company has not undertaken any trading activities as yet, there are no retained profits to reinvest back into the business.</p>

<div id="div25">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H26"><span class="bold">What is the balance sheet?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT38">The balance sheet is a snapshot in time. It is an ‘as at’ position. It shows the assets and the liabilities of the company at a particular point in time. The only two things that you will find on the balance sheet are the assets and the liabilities of the company.</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX216">

</div>
<div id="div26">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H27"><span class="bold"><a id="page15"></a>What is the profit &amp; loss account?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT39">The income statement, also known as the profit &amp; loss account (P&amp;L), is the company’s trading account. This is where a company will show its sales (also known as turnover, revenue, or income) and its costs or outgoings (including such things as wages and salaries). While the balance sheet is a snapshot in time, the profit &amp; loss account is a journey between two points in time (each point being represented by the balance sheet); the profit &amp; loss account shows the trading for a particular period of time, such as a day, a week, a month, or a year.</p>
</div>
<div id="div27">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H28"><span class="bold">How do we account for trade in cash?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT40">Arthur and Ben take the £100 cash and head off down to the local market where they meet George, who is selling apples for £1 each. Arthur and Ben agree to buy 100 apples from George. They hand over the £100 cash and George hands over the apples.</p>
</div>
<div id="div28">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H29"><span class="bold">Who owns the apples?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT41">Obviously it is Arthur and Ben (or, to be exact, A&amp;B Ltd). And, if they own the apples, they can do whatever they want with them. And they want to sell. So they meet Harry who agrees to buy the 100 apples for £500 (they are either very high-quality apples or Arthur and Ben are very persuasive). Harry hands over the £500 cash and Arthur and Ben hand over the 100 apples. Now who owns the apples? Again it is pretty obvious that Harry owns the apples and, if Harry owns the apples, then Arthur and Ben can record the trade in the books of A&amp;B Ltd.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT42">They have made sales of £500, their costs were £100, leaving a profit of £400.</p>
</div>
<div id="div29">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H210"><span class="bold">What does the balance sheet now look like?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT43">Now they can update the balance sheet. Having started the day with £100 in cash, turned that cash into apples and sold the apples for £500 cash, Arthur and Ben now have £500 in cash. They don’t have any other assets <a id="page16"></a>(remember, they have sold the apples). For the sake of this example, we will ignore tax, and so A&amp;B Ltd has no liabilities (remember they paid cash when they bought the apples from George). The net assets of A&amp;B are, therefore, £500.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT44">The net assets of £500 are represented by the shareholders’ funds of A&amp;B Ltd. That is, the original investment of £100 and the £400, which is the total profit the company has made ever since it started trading and is not yet given back to the shareholders; it has been reinvested back into the business by the directors on behalf of the shareholders.</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX217">

</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT45">Arthur and Ben could now choose to put A&amp;B Ltd into liquidation. In this case, the £500 cash would be divided between Arthur and Ben. The £250 that each receives would be their £50 original investment plus half (because each owns half of the company) of the retained profit of £400. But they don’t want to put the company into liquidation, they want to continue trading.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="div30">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H114"><span class="bold">How do we account for trading on credit?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT46">Arthur and Ben head back out to meet up with George, who is still selling apples for £1 each. Once again, George agrees to sell 100 apples for £100 <a id="page17"></a>to Arthur and Ben. Unfortunately, Arthur and Ben forgot to bring the cash with them.</p>
<div id="div31">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H211"><span class="bold">What is a creditor?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT47">So George agrees to sell the apples on credit; Arthur and Ben take ownership of the apples and agree to pay George the £100 the following day. George is a ‘creditor’ (sometimes referred to as a ‘payable’) to the business – someone to whom the business owes money.</p>
</div>
<div id="div32">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H212"><span class="bold">Who owns the apples?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT48">Now who owns the apples? The answer is Arthur and Ben because, even though they may not have paid for the apples, they have taken legal ownership – the title of the goods has changed hands. So, if Arthur and Ben own the apples, they can do with them whatever they want. And they want to sell them. So they go and meet Harry who again agrees to buy all of the apples for £5 each.</p>
</div>
<div id="div33">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H213"><span class="bold">What is a debtor?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT49">Unfortunately, Harry has also forgotten to bring any cash with him. So Arthur and Ben agree to sell the apples to Harry on condition that Harry agrees to pay for them the following day. So who owns the apples now? Harry, because even though he has not yet paid for them, the legal title has been transferred. Harry is a “debtor” (sometimes referred to as a “receivable”) to the business – someone who owes the business money. And so if Harry owns the apples Arthur and Ben can record the transaction in the books of A&amp;B Ltd.</p>
</div>
<div id="div34">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H214"><span class="bold">What does the P&amp;L look like?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT50">Sales were £500 and the costs were £100, leaving a profit for day two of £400. At the end of day two, Arthur and Ben can prepare the balance sheet of A&amp;B Ltd.</p>
</div>
<div id="div35">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H215"><span class="bold"><a id="page18"></a>What does the balance sheet look like?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT51">They started the day with £500 cash and, because none of the transactions involved cash, they finished the day with £500 cash. Do they have any other assets? Yes, the £500 that they are owed by Harry is treated as an asset. Harry is known as a debtor. Do they have any liabilities? Yes, the amount that they owe George for the purchase of the apples is a liability, in this case £100. George is known as a creditor. Thus, £500 of cash plus £500 owed by Harry less £100 owed to George results in net assets of £900.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT52">This is represented by the shareholders’ funds. The investment remains at £100. A&amp;B Ltd started the day with £400 of retained profits, generated an additional £400 profit during day two and so now finishes with £800 of retained profit. £800 of retained profit plus the £100 of investments equals £900 in total, equal to the net assets of the business; the balance sheet continues to balance.</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX218">

</div>
<div id="div36">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H115"><span class="bold"><a id="page19"></a>What if there is no trading?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT53">Day three and all this trading is very tiring for Arthur and Ben. So all they do is go and visit Harry, who pays them the £500 cash that he owes them and then they visit George and pay him the £100 that they owe. The balance of £400 cash they take home and add to the original £500 of cash. And, at the end of day three, they prepare their accounts.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT54">Total cash is now £900. They are not owed any money because Harry has paid them. They do not owe any money because George has been paid. And so net assets are still £900. The shareholders’ funds are also £900 – made up of the original £100 investment plus the £800 of retained profit, that is the total profit made ever since A&amp;B Ltd started trading, but not yet given back to shareholders.</p>

  <p class="text" id="text1">We have now learnt how a company is financially structured and how a company trades. But there is something else that is also very important to notice here.</p>
</div>
<div id="div37">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H116"><span class="bold">Are profit and cash the same thing?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT55">Look closely at the above accounts. The company started day one with £100 cash and finished day one with £500 cash – an increase of £400. It made <a id="page20"></a>a profit during day one of £400. During day one cash generated and profit were the same.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT56">In day two the company also made a £400 profit; but what about the amount of cash in the business? The company started with £500 cash and finished the day with £500 cash, in effect there was no increase in cash.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT57">During day three the company did not make a profit, as it was not trading. However, it started the day with £500 cash and finished the day with £900 cash, a total increase of £400 cash.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT58">And thus we see that profit and cash generated are not the same thing. You can make a profit without generating cash (as in day two) and you can also generate cash without making a profit (as in day three).</p>
  <ul id="ul17">
<li id="li29">Does your business make a profit?</li>
<li id="li30">Does your business generate cash?</li>
<li id="li31">Are the two figures (profit and cash) similar or very different?</li>
<li id="li32">Why do you think this is?</li>
  </ul>
<div id="div38">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H216"><span class="bold">What is accrual accounting?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT59">The profit made by a company is different from the cash generated due to <span class="bold">accrual accounting</span> or the <span class="bold">matching concept</span>. Under the accrual accounting concept we recognise income when we earn it, not when we physically receive the cash. We recognise costs when we incur them, not when we physically pay for them. And that is why profit and cash generated are not the same thing.</p>
<ul id="ul18">
   <li id="li33">Small companies are allowed to account on a cash basis. Why do you think this is?</li>

   <p class="CHAP_BX2_TXT" id="CHAP_BX2_TXT1">In this chapter we have looked at how a company is structured financially and how the accounting equation describes the balance sheet of a company. We also looked at how a company trades through the profit &amp; loss account – using the accrual or matching concept – to recognise income when it is earned and costs when they are incurred. The profit &amp; loss account reflects the trading during a period, whereas the balance sheet reflects the position of the company at a snapshot in time. Sales and costs are found in the profit &amp; loss account, whilst assets and liabilities are found in the balance sheet.</p>

 <li class="CHAP_BX1_LI" id="CHAP_BX1_LI1">Think about your business:

  <li class="CHAP_BX1_LI" id="CHAP_BX1_LI2">How much income do you think it generates?</li>

  <li class="CHAP_BX1_LI" id="CHAP_BX1_LI9">If you work for a retailer (such as Marks &amp; Spencer Plc) then this should be a pretty easy question – it will be at the point of sale (i.e. the checkout).</li>
  <li class="CHAP_BX1_LI" id="CHAP_BX1_LI10"><a id="page22"></a>But what if you are building an aircraft carrier? Do you show the sale in your accounts on the day that it is sold? Or is it the day that the contract is signed?</li>
