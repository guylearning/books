  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H192"><a id="page252"></a><span class="bold">What is a budget?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT704">Benjamin Franklin is credited with having said: ‘If you fail to plan, plan to fail.’ A company that fails to prepare budgets and then to use those budgets to control the business runs a high risk of failing.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT705">Importers-R-Us, which was used as a case study in <a href="chapter-005.html#Chapter5">Chapter 5</a>, is based on a real business (which, incidentally, is continuing to trade!). This case study is a good example of a company that is well run operationally, but is not so well run financially. As a company grows, the importance of good financial management, alongside operational management, cannot be over-estimated. Companies use budgets and other similar tools to financially manage their business.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT706">So what, exactly, is a budget?</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT707">Some people might tell you that a budget is a financial picture of the future (perhaps on a short-, medium- or long-term basis); others may see a budget as more of a forecast or plan to which you add (or take away) money; it could be just a future P&amp;L account; a benchmark or baseline. Either way, a budget is crucial to managing the business.</p>
  <ul id="ul112">
<li id="li220">Are budgets used in the financial running of your business?</li>
<li id="li221">Who is responsible for preparing them? The finance team or line managers?</li>
<li id="li222">Are they prepared and signed off before the beginning of the year (ideal) or is there a delay?</li>
<li id="li223">What is the process for preparing, submitting and authorising the budgets in your business?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div162">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H193"><span class="bold">How is a budget prepared?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT708">The business plan usually will start with an off-site meeting. The board of directors may head to the Maldives for a two-week session of blue-sky thinking, or the reality may be more along the lines of an afternoon in a hotel on the outskirts of Croydon.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT709">Either way, their aim is to establish the overall strategy of the business.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT710"><a id="page253"></a>This strategy is then translated into the operating plan – in effect who is going to do what in order to achieve the overall business strategy.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT711">The budget then becomes the financial implications of what you intend to do. Your business might want to gain a high-level overview of the next 10 years – a long-term forecast; or a more detailed view of the next 3 years – perhaps on a rolling basis.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT712">A budget is the financial plan for the next financial year. Once a budget has been set, it cannot (or should not) be altered; any updates are known as forecasts.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT713">So, if that is the theory, what is the reality? The board of directors work out what they are trying to achieve and produce their key performance indicators (KPIs) and key financial indicators (KFIs) that will be used to manage the business. The front line managers compile their budgets based on what they think that they can achieve in the way of resources (i.e. sales targets and cost implications); once compiled, these are sent upstairs to the senior management. The senior management start tearing their hair out and demanding higher sales and lower costs – and the front line managers feel squeezed between the demands of their bosses and what can actually be achieved within the given resources. It is the same the world over!</p>

<div id="div163">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H194"><span class="bold">What are the good reasons for budgeting?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT714">There are many good reasons for budgeting; here are some of them:</p>
<div id="div164">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H247"><a id="page254"></a>Planning</h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT715">Budgets help businesses plan in line with a long-term strategy. They ensure that the operational plans are consistent with the overall direction of the business and that those plans will deliver the expected value through total shareholder return (TSR) – that is, the dividends to be paid and the increase in the value of the shares.</p>
</div>
<div id="div165">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H248">Coordination</h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT716">Budgets increase the need for various departments or business units in an organisation to coordinate their activities. The sales team must speak to the purchasing team (the purchasing team need to buy what the sales team can sell); the human resources team must ensure that any costs of recruitment sit in the correct budget (do HR pay for recruitment or the business unit?); IT need to understand the planned initiatives for the following year – what are the implications? Are expansion plans going to need additional hardware or software? If so, in whose budget will these costs appear? Will they be capitalised?</p>
</div>
<div id="div166">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H249">Communication</h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT717">In a similar way to coordination, budgets help with the communication within the business. Not only must various business units communicate with each other, across the organisation, budgets also assist with the communication up and down an organisation. The senior management of the business communicate the strategy down to the business units, and the business units indicate back up the chain of command as to how they will implement that strategy through the compilation of the budgets.</p>
</div>
<div id="div167">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H250">Motivation</h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT718">Budgets can be used as a way of motivating employees. They give budget managers something to aim for personally and also create targets for the organisation as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div id="div168">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H251"><a id="page255"></a>Control</h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT719">By monitoring the actual costs and income against the original budget, managers can exercise a degree of control over the business units. This allows them to examine how the costs are changing compared with what was originally expected, and to adjust the forecast as necessary.</p>
</div>
<div id="div169">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H252">Evaluation</h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT720">A manager’s performance can be assessed against the original budget, as a budget can also be used as a target against which to benchmark the performance of individuals and teams within the business, as well as the business as a whole.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="div170">
<div id="div171">
<h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H195">What are the different types of budgets?</h3>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT721">Budgets can be prepared on an incremental or zero-based basis. Let us look at the difference between these two methods.</p>
<div id="div172">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H253">Incremental budgeting</h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT722">Imagine that James is planning his holiday. One way of looking at how much the holiday will cost is to look at how much it cost James to go on holiday last year and use that as a benchmark. This is an incremental approach to budgeting. Incremental budgeting involves examining the actual spend in a previous period and then adjusting up or down to budget for the spend in a future period.</p>
</div>
<div id="div173">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H254">Zero-based budgeting</h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT723">An alternative way for James to budget for his holiday is on a zero-based basis, which is similar to starting with a blank sheet of paper. This involves James working out exactly what he intends to do on holiday and then working out the cost implications of each of those activities. So James works out the cost of getting to the airport; the cost of the flights to Dubai; the cost of the transfers; the cost of the hotel; the cost of eating out for three nights; the cost of renting a boat for a day; the cost of lunch; and so on. He is then <a id="page256"></a>able to provide a fairly accurate picture of how much the holiday is going to cost him (and may decide that a week’s camping in the West Country is a cheaper alternative).</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT724">So, what are the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods?</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT725">Incremental budgeting is a much quicker and easier way of compiling a budget. If James’ holiday this year is going to be almost exactly the same as a previous year, then there is no point in his reinventing the wheel each time he goes on holiday; last year’s actual expenditure will give a fairly accurate indication of this year’s expected expenditure or budget. However, if James needs to save some money or incurs an unexpected item of expenditure, then there is no indication of where that money can be saved.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT726">Zero-based budgeting will take a lot longer to compile. James will have to have an accurate idea of what he is going to do on holiday when compiling his budget, and he may not know exactly how much each of the activities will cost – therefore, he will have to make assumptions. The advantage of zero-based budgeting is that, if James incurs an item of unexpected expenditure during the holiday, for example he eats out for four nights rather than three, then he can quickly identify where he might be able to make the savings, for example by not renting the boat for a day.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT727">In reality, budgets usually are a combination of the two approaches. New business plans and projects usually follow a more zero-based approach while business-as-usual activities are usually more incremental.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT728">If James is compiling the budget for the training department for next year, he may use both incremental and zero-based budgeting. Probably, he will use incremental budgeting for the business-as-usual activities, such as salaries; and he could use incremental budgeting for the actual costs of training – for example, he spent £100,000 last year and so he intends to spend a similar amount this year. But he could use zero-based budgeting for the actual costs of training. After analysing the training needs of the business, he has established that he needs to run a graduate training programme; negotiation skills programme for the procurement team; and financial training for the senior management team. He is able to put together a training programme for the forthcoming year and look at the costs associated with each of those workshops. This will give him a clear and accurate picture of the training <a id="page257"></a>costs for the next year, when those costs will be incurred, and this effectively becomes his budget.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT729">If he needs to reduce his budget for whatever reason, James is now in a position to identify where he can reduce the budget and the implications for the business. He could cut the graduate training programme and end up with a bunch of graduates who have no idea about the business in which they are working. He could cut the negotiation skills programme, which may cause costs to increase (as the procurement team are unable to negotiate better prices). Clearly he does not want to cut the financial training programme!</p>
<ul id="ul113">
   <li id="li224">Does your department prepare zero-based or incremental budgets?</li>
   <li id="li225">Is there a culture of ‘use it or lose it’ with regard to budgets in your business?</li>
   <li id="li226">Why do you think this is?</li>
   <li id="li227">What might you do to change this culture (should you wish to)?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="div174">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H196"><span class="bold">How should budgets be phased?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT730">When compiling his budget, James must consider the phasing or profile of the budget. It would be rational to take the total salary bill for his department and divide by 12 when allocating on a monthly basis. But, if he is intending to attend an HR conference, then this cost should be allocated to the month in which it was incurred (remember – incurred, not paid or booked!) and not spread over 12 months. Thus, some costs will be allocated across the months and some costs will be allocated to specific months.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT731">When compiling his budget, James will focus on his P&amp;L account. If he is running a cost centre, this will involve the costs of running his business unit. If he is running a profit centre, then it will also include sales and other income.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT732">James also needs to consider the capex budget for his department. Perhaps he is planning to recruit a new member of his team; the costs associated with this recruitment will appear in his P&amp;L account, but what about the new laptop for the new employee? This is an item of capital expenditure and must also be budgeted for.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT733"><a id="page258"></a>As James is able to produce his sales budget, so the finance team, working on how long it will take to collect the money from the customer, will be able to budget the trade debtors. And, as James is able to produce this costs budget, so the finance team, working on how long it will take to pay suppliers, will be able to budget trade creditors. The finance team are also able to model the stock turnover – that is how long it takes from the purchase of a raw material to the sale of a finished good.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT734">By ensuring that costs for specific items – such as the HR conference – are allocated to the correct period (and not just allocated as 1/12th into each month), James is now allowing the finance team to build up a picture of the cash flow implications of his budget.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT735">With the capex budget and working capital budget, the finance team are able to produce a cash flow forecast – a crucial forecast for any business. This will enable the finance team to identify any future periods when funds may be tight and take the necessary action sufficiently in advance. This may involve cutting costs or it may involve going to the banks or shareholders to raise additional finance.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT736">The finance team will also consolidate the budget produced by James and his business unit, with the budgets produced by James’s colleagues and all of their respective business units, in order to provide an overall picture of the business. This budget is then used to monitor the business on an ongoing basis by the board of directors.</p>
  <ul id="ul114">
<li id="li228">What costs and incomes are seasonal in your business?</li>
<li id="li229">How do you think that this affects cash flow?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div175">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H197"><span class="bold">How are budgets prepared?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT737">To summarise, in order to prepare his budget, James first must define the objectives of his business unit. He must then work out who is responsible for which area of the budget – for example, does the new laptop sit in his budget or in the budget of the IT department? He must then gather all of the facts and information available and make assumptions, where necessary. Once he has gathered all of the information, he must decide what to submit, <a id="page259"></a>test and check this with his manager, and then agree to the final budget. This is then used to monitor and control the business on an ongoing basis.</p>
</div>
<div id="div176">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H198"><span class="bold">Why should we monitor actual figures against the budget?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT738">By regular monitoring of the actual figures against the original budget, James is able to understand what is happening within his business unit. How are costs changing? Why are they changing? How is the year likely to turn out? Has he accounted for the likelihood of unforeseen financial outcomes? What does it mean when he is re-forecasting? What has he learned?</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT739">Monitoring actual expenditure against the original budget is an ongoing learning process. The budget will never be 100 per cent accurate; James is aiming to create as accurate a picture of the future as possible in order to enable him to manage his business unit both financially as well as operationally.</p>
</div>
<div id="div177">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H199"><span class="bold">What happens at month end?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT740">At the end of each month, the finance team close the books – which means that no new invoices can be posted into the month that has just been closed. The timetable for this exercise will differ from business to business, but below is a typical month-end timetable:</p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD60"><span class="bold">Days 1–4</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD61">The first step is for the finance team to extract the raw financial information from the management information systems, and send this information to the business unit managers.</p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD62"><span class="bold">Days 5–6</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD63">The business unit managers will review this information and identify costs that have not been included and must be accrued for, and costs that have been included and should be removed through prepayment. They should also identify any items of expenditure that have been posted incorrectly to their cost code.</p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD64"><a id="page260"></a><span class="bold">Day 7</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD65">The finance team post these adjustments and then produce the final management figures. The business unit managers write their commentary, based on the actual figures, in comparison with the budget and justify areas of over-expenditure or under-expenditure.</p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD66"><span class="bold">Days 8–9</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD67">The finance team collate the submissions from the various business units and produce a draft board pack, which is then reviewed.</p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD68"><span class="bold">Days 10–12</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD69">The final board pack is then submitted to the board of directors, who use the information to run the business.</p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD70"><span class="bold">Days 13–14</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD71">Usually, there is then some form of review and feedback loop, for the business to learn how to improve process. At the end of the month, the finance team get ready to close the books again for that month. In fact, life in the finance team is a little bit like life in the movie <span class="Italic">Groundhog Day</span>.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image1226"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0260_01.png" width="509" height="194"/>

  <ul id="ul115">
<li id="li230">What is the month end process in your business?</li>
<li id="li231">How does this affect your department?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div178">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H1100"><span class="bold">What is involved in the management information review?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT741">When undertaking his management information review, James will compare his actual expenditure against his budgeted expenditure. He will do this for the months under review and may also do it on a year-to-date basis. He may also compare this month’s actual expenditure with the actual expenditure from the same month in the previous year; and perhaps on a <a id="page261"></a>year-to-date basis – how much he has spent so far this year compared with how much had been spent this far in the previous year. He may review the original budget for the full year, and may feel the need to update the forecast for the full year. He may also compare the full-year forecast and the original budget with the total actual expenditure from the previous year.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT742">So, James has a large amount of data to analyse. He needs to consider the level of detail into which he will go when comparing the numbers – if the figures are too high level he will not have sufficient information to allow him to manage his business unit; however, too much detail and he will drown in information overload.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT743">James needs to consider how costs have been allocated. What degree of control does James have over the costs, which are allocated centrally to his business unit? If James has no control over costs (such as centrally allocated rent, or depreciation charges), he should not worry about them when compiling his management report.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT744">Finally, James should undertake some variance analysis. Is the variance an underspend or an overspend? Is it due to budgeting error or to an unexpected event? Is it a controllable cost that James can influence? Why is he looking at this variance? Is it likely to reoccur? How much will it cost to investigate? Does James need to adjust the forecast? Does the variance impact another department? All of these questions should be answered in his management report and submitted as part of the board pack.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT745">One way for James to gain a good understanding of the underlying causes of a variance is to undertake a flexed budget analysis.</p>
  <ul id="ul116">
<li id="li232">Do you receive monthly management information (MI)?</li>

  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT751">But, in actual fact, on closer examination, Oscar identifies two drivers of the sales variance – the number of units that have been sold and the price at which they were sold. In order to examine this variance in more detail, Oscar decides to flex the budget. The original budget was based on <a id="page264"></a>producing and selling 88,000 units. Oscar managed to produce and sell only 78,800; so what would the original budget have looked like, if he had known that he was going to make and sell 78,800? This is called flexing the budget, and produces the following analysis:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2167">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1231"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/t0264_01.png" width="641" height="393"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT752">The total variance on the sales is £26,024 (right-hand column – column 4 – above). The original budgeted sales were £264,000 (column 1), but, if Oscar had prepared the budget based on sales of 78,800 units, then the budgeted sales figure would have been £236,400 (column 3).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT753">So, Oscar concludes that sales were down by £27,600 because he made and sold fewer units. However, the total variance is £26,024 (column 4), which suggests that those units that were sold were sold at a higher price. While the budgeted price was £3.00 per tin, the actual average price was £3.02 (that is, £237,976 of actual sales divided by 78,800 of actual units sold)</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT754"><a id="page265"></a>So, while sales were down due to the volume produced and sold, there was a small positive compensation, as the price was slightly higher than anticipated. Why were sales down? Is it because not so many units were produced? Or perhaps Oscar increased the price and found that his customers were very price sensitive (Company A – see ‘operational gearing’ in <a href="chapter-004.html#Chapter4">Chapter 4</a>). Either way, Oscar is now armed with much more of an insight into his business and can use this information when putting together his forecast (should he forecast lower sales volume going forward? Higher price? Or both?).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT755">What about the costs of the business? We are now supplied with additional data – the actual amount of raw materials (inputs) used and the actual number of hours worked:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2169">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1233"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/t0265_01.png" width="560" height="297"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT756">What about the costs of the raw materials? There is a £11,845 (circled above) positive variance; Oscar expects this, as fewer units were sold. But can Oscar undertake more detailed analysis, especially if he is told that the actual number of units used was 79,500?</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT757">He now has three different factors, which contribute to the £11,845 positive variance: the number of units sold; the efficiency in using the units of input to make the units of output; and the price per unit of output. Follow through the thinking process carefully using the table below:</p>

<li id="li240"><span class="bold">Second line – Flexed budget</span> <span class="bold">(based on lower expected volume): </span>the flexed budget (based on actual number of units sold) would have been to use 78,800 units of input, which at a cost of £1.30 would have cost a total of £102,440. Thus, there was a saving of £11,960 due to lower sales volume.</li>
<li id="li241"><span class="bold">Third line – Flexed budget (based on actual units of raw material used): </span>the actual number of units of input used was 79,500 – so the production line was less efficient than expected (perhaps some tins were damaged); at a cost of £1.30 per tin, this results in an adverse variance of £910.</li>
<li class="LIST_LAST_PARA" id="LIST_LAST_PARA29"><span class="bold">Fourth line – Actual cost incurred: </span>the actual cost was £102,555 – so each tin must have cost £1.29 rather than £1.30; this gives a positive variance of £795.</li>

</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT759">Now Oscar can undertake some detailed analysis. Was it a good idea to pay a lower price? Did this result in lower quality? Did this mean that some tins were easily damaged and had to be thrown away? Or were some tins stolen? Or lost? Undertaking a flexed budget analysis gives Oscar much more <a id="page267"></a>information on how the costs are changing – and much more information that he can use in the forecasting to produce an accurate picture of how the year is expected to turn out.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT760">Now let us turn to the labour.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT761">Oscar is told that the actual hours worked during the month were 2,650. See if you can perform the same analysis as for the raw material input above. Use the thought process that Oscar went through and then compare your answer to Oscar’s analysis.</p>

  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H1102"><span class="bold">What is forecasting?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT766">Having prepared the budget and undertaken detailed analysis of the actual figures and how they compare to the original budget, managers can then prepare or update their forecasts.</p>
  <ul id="ul121">
<li id="li248">How often are forecasts prepared in your business?</li>

  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div181">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H1103"><span class="bold">Why forecast?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT767">Forecasting is a crucial element in the financial management of the business. The budget for the last month of the year may have been prepared and submitted up to 18 months previously – the figures will, therefore, be based on assumptions.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT768">The forecast aims to update these figures with more accurate information – providing a clearer and more accurate picture of how the year is expected to turn out for the business.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT769">Just as the finance team were able to prepare the balance sheet and the cash flow forecast from the consolidated (P&amp;L account and capex) budgets from the various business units, so they can prepare these statements from the forecasts provided by the business units. While a small increase in costs in one part of the business may not appear to be an issue, when consolidated and fed into the forecasts, they may have a very material (i.e. significant) impact.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT770">As Oscar undertook his flexed budget analysis, he was able to gain greater insight into how his costs were changing and why. By feeding this information into his forecast, he can create a more accurate picture of how the year will turn out for his business unit. If this is being done for all of the business units, then the board of directors will not only see how the business is performing compared with the budget, but also they will be <a id="page270"></a>provided with an increasingly accurate picture of how the business will develop in the future – and in particular the cash implications.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT771">In <a href="chapter-005.html#Chapter5">Chapter 5</a> we examined the accounts of IRU. If the business had been running a detailed budgeting and forecasting process, then it is unlikely that the business would have run into such difficulties. Sometimes the answer to cash flow issues is not to sell more!</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD1" id="CHAP_BX2_AD18">
<h3 class="CHAP_BX2_TTL_AD" id="CHAP_BX2_TTL_AD1"><span class="bold">Chapter summary</span></h3>
<p class="CHAP_BX2_TXT" id="CHAP_BX2_TXT22">In this chapter, we have pulled together all of the topics covered so far to demonstrate how they are all important to the modern-day manager. An understanding of how a company is structured and how it trades – in particular the balance sheet and cash flow statement – that sit behind the P&amp;L account for which a manager is responsible, will provide a greater appreciation of the implications of financial decisions.</p>
<p class="CHAP_BX2_TXT" id="CHAP_BX2_TXT23">The ability to determine the KFIs and KPIs to measure and monitor on an ongoing basis; the understanding of how to create (shareholder) value in the business; and the ability to grasp the concepts of how business plans are created are all crucial skills to assist the business in achieving its financial, as well as strategic, objectives.</p>
<p class="CHAP_BX2_TXT" id="CHAP_BX2_TXT24">An appreciation of the finances of a business will allow today’s manager to add value to the budgeting and forecasting process. These are not designed merely to keep the finance team busy (despite what you might think) but are crucial in allowing the board of directors to effectively manage the business.</p>
