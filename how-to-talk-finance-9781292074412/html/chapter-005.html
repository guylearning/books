  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT416">It is 2010. You have just arrived at the office one morning when your bosses call you into their office. They explain that they are meeting a new (fictional) supplier (Importers-R-Us – hereafter called IRU) in a few hours’ time and they need your assistance. The supplier is an import/distribution company (i.e. they don’t actually make anything) and, potentially, is going to supply a key product to your company – so your boss wants to be confident that IRU is financially, as well as operationally, stable. He has managed to obtain the latest set of their accounts* and would like you to analyse these accounts prior to the meeting.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT417">*Not all of the pages have been included, but you have all of the relevant information to undertake your analysis.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT418">Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to analyse the accounts of the supplier, conclude as to whether you would be happy to use them as a supplier and also identify any areas of concern (and suggestions that you might like to make to IRU).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT419">In order to assist you, below is a checklist of questions that you should answer. When answering the questions and performing the calculations, try to interpret your answers and think about what this is telling you about the business. Try to resist the temptation to refer to the answer until you have completed the exercise! Good luck!</p>

<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H244"><span class="bold">Importers-R-Us case study – the answer</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT420">In order to answer the case study, we will go through each question step by step:</p>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING1"><span class="bold">1</span> Is it profitable? Can you follow the profit from the P&amp;L through to the movement in retained profits in the balance sheet?</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD5">Do you want to enter into business with a profitable company? The answer must be yes – especially if they are going to be a long-term supplier on whom you are going to depend. We do not want them to be making enormous profits (suggesting that we are paying too much) but we want them to be profitable.</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD31">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image31"><a id="page160"></a><img alt="Profit and loss account" src="../images/t0160_01.png" width="587" height="361"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD6">The answer is that yes, it is profitable. IRU made a profit of £670,000 during the year, which is good, and we can award the company a tick <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/>.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD7">If you look at the balance sheet, you will see the retained profit (called ‘Profit and loss account’) under the ‘Capital and reserves’ heading (another word for shareholders’ funds or equity). The company started the year with £2,291,660 and finished the year with £2,788,738.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD8">So, IRU started the year with £2.3 million in retained profit or retained earnings (that is, the total amount of profit that the company has made, ever since it started trading, and has not yet given back to shareholders), it made an additional £0.7 million in profit but ended the year with £2.8 million in retained earnings. Clearly, these numbers do not add up.</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD32">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image32"><img alt="Balance sheet" src="../images/t0160_02.png" width="604" height="694"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD9"><a id="page161"></a>You will notice that, just to the left of the £2,788,738 is the number 25. This is the number of the note and, if we want to find out more about these numbers, we should refer to Note 25.</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD33">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image33"><img alt="Profit and loss account" src="../images/t0161_01.png" width="582" height="207"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD10">Note 25 shows us that the company not only made a profit of £670k, but also paid £173k of this profit out to the shareholders, reinvesting the remainder of £497k back into the business. So IRU is a profitable business, which is paying some dividends (to keep the shareholders happy) but is reinvesting most of the profit back into the business, which, again, is good, and earns the company a second tick <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/></p>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING2"><span class="bold">2</span> What is the operational gearing (ratio of fixed to variable costs) – is it low risk (Company A) or high risk (Company B)?</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD11">If you refer to the P&amp;L account, you can see the fixed and variable costs of the business. The cost of sales are generally the variable costs <a id="page162"></a>– remember, the more goods that IRU wants to sell, the more goods it has to buy. The ‘Other operating charges’ relates to the fixed costs of the business – rent, rates, light, heat, HR, finance, etc. IRU has high variable costs (Cost of sales) relative to its fixed costs (Other operating charges) and is, therefore, low in its operational gearing (i.e. more like Company A). We like to do business with a low-risk supplier, as they are less likely to go bust, so this is good; however, we need to realise that they are very price sensitive, so may not be open to a huge amount of price negotiation! We can, therefore, allocate a third tick to the company <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/></p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD34">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image34"><img alt="Profit and loss account" src="../images/t0162_01.png" width="589" height="372"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING3"><span class="bold">3</span> How is it funded? Debt and/or equity?</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD12">In order to determine how the company is funded, we should first crack the balance sheet by identifying the five main elements. Have another look at the balance sheet and see if you can identify the five main sections:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD35">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image35"><a id="page163"></a><img alt="Balance sheet" src="../images/t0163_01.png" width="599" height="637"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD13">IRU has fixed (or non-current) assets of £286,898; this will include the tables and chairs, etc. that are used to run the business. The current assets are £7,771,130 and the current liabilities (referred to here as ‘Creditors: amounts falling due within one year’) are £5,210,966. Remember, sometimes similar things are referred to by different names; however, you should be able to work out what each item is through a process of logical deduction – ‘Creditors’ (people to whom we owe money – so ‘Liabilities’); ‘due within one year’ (payable soon – so ‘Current’).</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD14">Just below this number is ‘Net current assets’ of £2,560,164. These are the current assets (£7,771,130) net of, or less, the current liabilities (£5,210,164). Net current assets is, therefore, another term for working capital.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD15"><a id="page164"></a>The next line down states ‘Total assets less current liabilities’. This is the net current assets (£2,560,124) plus the fixed assets of £286,898. ‘Total assets less current liabilities’ is, therefore, another term for ‘total capital’!</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD16">The provisions for liabilities actually refers to tax that has to be paid, but not for a while. If we had to pay it within a year, it would be included in the current liabilities line. Thus, this must be the non-current (or long-term) liabilities.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD17">Finally, the capital and reserves refers to the shareholders’ funds or equity in the business.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD18">We can now, therefore, crack the balance sheet:</p>
<div class="inline_block" id="inline_block67">
   <p class="CHAP_TXT_AD1" id="CHAP_TXT_AD167"><span class="bold">Balance sheet analysis</span></p>

<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1147"><img alt="Balance sheet analysis" src="../images/t0164_01.png" width="597" height="192"/>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD19">The <span class="bold">debt</span> is £0.021 million and the <span class="bold">equity</span> is £2.826 million. As we have seen above, the debt is not really debt, but is a deferred tax liability. Therefore, the answer to the question is that IRU is a company funded entirely by equity, with no debt.</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD36">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image36"><a id="page165"></a><img alt="Balance sheet" src="../images/t0165_01.png" width="596" height="648"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD20">Is this good or bad? Well, as a customer this must be good for us. Why? Because IRU does <span class="bold">not</span> have to pay a dividend and does <span class="bold">not</span> have to repay the equity capital invested, so it is a lower risk (remember, if it was funded by debt, then it would <span class="bold">have</span> to ensure that it could service that debt by paying interest <span class="bold">and</span> repay the capital), and so this is good for us as a potential customer and earns a fourth tick <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/>.</p>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING4"><span class="bold">4</span> If equity, is it through investment or retained profits?</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD21">So, we have established that IRU is funded through equity, but is this equity through direct investment by the shareholders or through profits being reinvested back into the business? To find the answer, we need to look at the bottom of the balance sheet under ‘Capital and reserves’:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD37">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image37"><a id="page166"></a><img alt="Capital and reserves" src="../images/t0166_01.png" width="595" height="152"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD22">The shareholders have invested approximately £34k in the business (share capital of £26,199 and share premium of £7,651), while £2,788,738 of profits has been reinvested back into the business. IRU is, therefore, clearly funded through the reinvestment of profits.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD23">Is this good or bad? Well, this must be good. IRU is a profitable business; some of that profit is returned to shareholders as a dividend, but a substantial amount is being reinvested back into the business. We can add another tick to the list <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/>.</p>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING5"><span class="bold">5</span> If debt, what is the interest cover (can it service its debt?)</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD24">Under question 4, we established that IRU is funded by equity, with no debt at all appearing on the balance sheet, so this appears to be an irrelevant question. In any case, let us look at the P&amp;L account again:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD38">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image38"><img alt="Profit and loss account" src="../images/t0166_02.png" width="586" height="420"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD25"><a id="page167"></a>The company is making an operating profit (also known as earnings before interest and taxation, or EBIT) of nearly £1 million (£990,140, to be precise) and is paying interest of approximately £50,000 (£52,730). This means that the interest cover is 20 x (i.e. the EBIT is 20 × the interest payable) so the company is easily able to service the debt – and earns another tick <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/>.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD26">But don’t you think that this is a little odd? Why is IRU paying interest at all when we have just concluded that it is 100 per cent equity funded, with no debt at all? If you noticed this when going through the case study, then this is good – it means that you are starting to <span class="bold">read</span> the accounts and not just perform the calculations.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD27">We will revisit the reason that IRU is paying interest when it appears to have no debt later.</p>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING6"><span class="bold">6</span> Does it have enough working capital (liquidity ratio)?</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD28">Let us return to the balance sheet and examine the net current assets, or working capital of the business:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD39">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image39"><img alt="Balance sheet" src="../images/t0167_01.png" width="600" height="636"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD29"><a id="page168"></a>The company has £7.8 million of current assets (£7,771,130) and £5.2 million of current liabilities (£5,210,966). £7.8 million divided by £5.2 million gives a ratio of approximately 1.5; so, for every £1 that IRU owes and has to pay within one year, the company has £1.50 of assets that either are cash or will become cash quite soon. Again, this is good and takes us to seven ticks <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/>.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD30">So, let us summarise where we have got to so far. IRU is a profitable company. Some of that profit is being paid out as a dividend, but most is being reinvested back into the business, which is its principal source of funding. It has low operational gearing and low financial gearing. It has no problems meeting its interest payments (although it is a little odd that it is actually paying interest) and it appears to have adequate working capital. If you were starting to think that this is a company with which you could feel comfortable doing business, then you would be right.</p>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING7"><span class="bold">7</span> What about the acid test?</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD31">The acid test is exactly the same as the current or liquidity ratio, but ignoring stock:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD310">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image310"><img alt="Balance sheet" src="../images/t0168_01.png" width="593" height="671"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD32"><a id="page169"></a>Deducting stock of £5.441 million from current assets of £7.771 million leaves £2.330 million; this, divided by current liabilities of 5.211 million, gives a ratio of 0.45; this means that, for every £1 that the company owes and has to pay soon, it has only 45p of assets that are going to become cash, ignoring stock. This is of concern to us as, if the company cannot sell its stock (for whatever reason - perhaps it has become obsolete), then it will struggle to meet its obligations as they fall due and will no longer be a <span class="bold">going concern</span>.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD33">Companies that are trading and expected to continue to trade for the foreseeable future are described as being a going concern. It is illegal for the directors to continue to trade if they believe that the company is not a going concern – i.e. it is illegal for a company to enter into a contract to buy goods and services, knowing that it will be unable to pay for them.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD34">This is of concern to us, and earns the company its first negative mark <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="cros" src="../images/cross.png" height="18" width="20"/></p>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING8"><span class="bold">8</span> What is its working capital requirement?</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD35">With the information from the balance sheet and profit &amp; loss account, we can work out the company’s working capital requirement in days.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD36">To find the figures on trade debtors, you need to look in Note 14, which provides the breakdown of the trade and other debtors figure on the face of the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD37">To find the figures on trade creditors, you need to look in Note 15, which provides the breakdown of the creditors: amounts falling due within one year figure on the face of the balance sheet.</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD311">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image311"><a id="page170"></a><img alt="Stock Turnover" src="../images/t0170_01.png" width="628" height="887"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD38">The working capital requirement is 131 days! This is a long time! It is taking the company, on average, 157 days to sell its stock and a further 42 days to collect the money that is owed by its customers. Even by delaying payment to its suppliers for 67 days, it still has a very significant time gap for which to fund the business.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD39"><a id="page171"></a>This is not good, and earns the company a second negative mark: <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="cros" src="../images/cross.png" height="18" width="20"/> <img alt="cros" src="../images/cross.png" height="18" width="20"/></p>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING9"><span class="bold">9</span> Is it generating cash?</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD40">If we revisit the P&amp;L account, we will see that IRU is a profitable business; in fact, it is generating nearly £1 million of operating profit:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD312">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image312"><img alt="Profit and loss account" src="../images/t0171_01.png" width="596" height="389"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD41">But, if we now look at the cash flow statement, the top line – called ‘Net cash (outflow)/inflow from operating activities’ – is a negative figure of £270,135. This line is, effectively, the cash profit that the business is making (or, in this case, a cash loss).</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD313">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image313"><img alt="Cash flow statement" src="../images/t0171_02.png" width="590" height="334"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD42"><a id="page172"></a>How can a company, that appears to be making such a large profit, be making such a large loss? The answer is to be found in Note 27.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD43">You may remember that, for National Grid, the reconciliation that turned their accounting profit into a cash profit was to be found at the top of the cash flow statement. Well, some companies – such as IRU – choose to show this reconciliation in the notes to the accounts:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD314">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image314"><img alt="Notes to the statement of cash flows" src="../images/t0172_01.png" width="598" height="326"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD44">The top line shows the £990k of operating profit. The first adjustment is to add back depreciation. This figure is quite small, which we would expect as the company has very low fixed assets (it is more of a service company – acting as the middleman – and will rent any office space or warehousing that it needs).</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD45">Then we see a negative £1.3 million, due to increase in stocks. Think about this for a minute. If you start buying lots of stock, what impact does it have on your profit? The answer is nothing. When you buy stock, you are merely transferring one form of asset (cash) into another form of asset (stock). This is known as a balance sheet transaction. But what impact does this have on your cash? Negative, of course, because you have spent all that cash buying stock. So IRU has been buying stock – and tying increasing amounts of money up in this stock.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD46">What about the next line: ‘Increase in debtors’? If you sell lots of stock (which the company has been doing), then you will recognise these sales in the P&amp;L account. But, if you do not collect the money owed to you, then it will have a negative effect on your cash flow.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD47"><a id="page173"></a>Similarly, ‘Increase in creditors’ is the opposite. If you buy stock, but don’t pay for it, then it will have a positive effect on your cash flow.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD48">So IRU is a profitable company, but is tying up an additional £1.3 million in stock, has failed to collect an extra £1 million from customers who owe it money, does not appear to have any cash, and so has not been paying its suppliers, so the amount owed to suppliers has risen by £1 million.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD49">This clearly is not a good situation, and earns another negative mark <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="tick" src="../images/tick.png" height="18" width="19"/> <img alt="cros" src="../images/cross.png" height="18" width="20"/> <img alt="cros" src="../images/cross.png" height="18" width="20"/> <img alt="cros" src="../images/cross.png" height="18" width="20"/></p>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING10"><span class="bold">10</span> Can you follow the accounting profit (P&amp;L)?through to the cash profit (cash flow statement) and then through?to the movement in cash on the balance sheet?</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD50">Let us return to the cash flow statement again:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD315">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image315"><img alt="Cash flow statement" src="../images/t0173_01.png" width="582" height="355"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD51">IRU is making a £270k cash loss. It is paying £52k in interest; it is paying tax, because it is profitable, of £262k; it is investing in the business, because it is growing, to the tune of £153k; it is paying dividends (not sure why – it clearly cannot afford to) of £173k. All of these transactions result in a total cash outflow during the year of £928k – that is nearly £1 million!</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD52">This clearly is not sustainable!</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD53"><a id="page174"></a>Now return to the balance sheet. The company started the year with approximately £12,000 in cash and finished the year with £44 (yes, that is £44 – not £44,000!).</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD316">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image316"><img alt="Balance sheet" src="../images/t0174_01.png" width="606" height="698"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD54">The company has no cash. The £44 is probably in the petty cash tin under the receptionist’s desk. If you have no cash, then you probably have an overdraft at the bank. An overdraft is a liability – and is payable on demand – which makes it a current liability. This will be in the ‘Creditors: amounts falling due within one year line’ so let us take a closer look at what makes up the £5.211 million. We can find the breakdown in Note 15:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD317">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image317"><a id="page175"></a><img alt="15 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year" src="../images/t0175_01.png" width="606" height="332"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD55">An overdraft is like negative cash; IRU started the year with an overdraft of £0.5 million and finished the year with an overdraft of £1.4 million; the cash outflow was £0.9 million, which ties back to the cash flow statement.</p>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING11"><span class="bold">11</span> Is there anything else that looks funny?</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD56">We observed that, while the company can meet its interest payments based on profitability, it was odd that it should be paying interest at all.</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD57">We can now conclude that this is not odd – the interest relates to the overdraft!</p>
<p class="HANGING" id="HANGING12"><span class="bold">12</span> What about commitments and contingent liabilities?</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD3" id="CHAP_BX2_AD318">
<div class="IMAGE3" id="image318"><img alt="16 Commitments under hire purchase agreements" src="../images/t0175_02.png" width="589" height="174"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD58">The commitments and contingent liabilities is a form of off balance sheet finance – i.e. amounts that the company owes (because it has entered into a contract to pay these amounts over a future period), but do not appear on the balance sheet (because the company does not owe this amount today).</p>
<p class="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD" id="CHAP-EXT_TXT_AD59">The above note suggests that this is not an issue for IRU.</p>

<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H245"><a id="page176"></a><span class="bold">Importers-R-Us case study – conclusions</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT421">So, what is our conclusion with regards to IRU?</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT422">The company is a perfect example of a profitable business, which is growing rapidly (its sales have increased by 60 per cent from 2008 to 2009), but is running out of cash.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT423">At the end of each month, the managing director has to phone up the bank manager to ask permission to pay the staff. If the bank manager says no then it is game over – last one out turns off the lights.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT424">The bank manager probably will not say this just yet (the overdraft is secured on the assets of the company – mainly the debtors and stock), but losing £1 million per year in cash clearly is unsustainable.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT425">It would appear that the best course of action is not to use IRU as your key supplier until is has sorted out its finances.</p>
</div>
<div id="div128">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H246"><span class="bold">Importers-R-Us case study – advice</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT426">So, what advice would you give IRU?</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT427">Well, the first thing to do might be to call a meeting with the sales team and the purchasing team, as they do not appear to be communicating well with each other.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT428">Suggest to the purchasing team that they go on holiday (or at least stop buying – anything!). When they get back, they should buy only what the sales team can sell.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT429">Now suggest to the sales team that they go into the warehouse, look at what is on the shelves, and focus their efforts on selling that stock.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT430">And, while we are there, give the warehouse manager a clip round the ear. Someone needs to be managing the stock – looking at each line of stock and assessing how quickly it is moving. The stock controller should be using the stock turnover calculation to assess the stock on a line-by-line basis – identifying quick-moving lines (which need to be restocked) and slow moving lines (and what to do about the slow-moving items).</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT431"><a id="page177"></a>What else?</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT432">Perhaps you would like to speak to the credit controller (someone who makes sure the debtors pay on time). Who? Ah – so the company needs to appoint a credit controller (or two), give them a list of all the companies that owe IRU money, a baseball bat and a telephone, and tell them to get on with it.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT433">You also need to speak to someone in Accounts Payable – they need to get on the phone and keep the suppliers sweet. If you delay paying your suppliers for long enough (and 67 days is quite a long time!), then they will stop supplying you. The wheels will come off your business model in a very short space of time if your suppliers stop supplying your business.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT434">And, while you are in the accounts department, you might want to speak to the financial controller. While this company might be well run operationally, it does not appear to be particularly well run financially. They need to implement a comprehensive budgeting system, produce management accounts and, ultimately, undertake accurate cash flow forecasting. They will then be in a position to go and see the bank manager and negotiate the conversion of the overdraft into a long-term loan and agree the terms of repayment of this loan.</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2_AD1" id="CHAP_BX2_AD15">
   <h3 class="CHAP_BX2_TTL" id="CHAP_BX2_TTL8"><span class="bold">Chapter summary</span></h3>
   <p class="CHAP_BX2_TXT" id="CHAP_BX2_TXT13">So far we have been through the basic financial structure of a business and looked at the key financial statements and how they interact with each other.</p>
   <p class="CHAP_BX2_TXT" id="CHAP_BX2_TXT14">We have then undertaken some key ratio analysis, to help us to become more familiar with those statements. This exercise also helped show how much and what sort of information is contained in those financial statements.</p>
   <p class="CHAP_BX2_TXT" id="CHAP_BX2_TXT15">The first half of this book has been focused on building up the big picture of a business and how it works from a financial perspective. This is a key part of <span class="Italic">How to Talk Finance</span> – understanding the background to the internal financial workings of a business. Remember, line managers in a business generally will be responsible just for the P&amp;L for their <a id="page178"></a>department – the finance department will run the balance sheet of the business that sits behind the P&amp;L, and the cash flow for the company, too. Understanding how these three interact is crucial in understanding the finances of a company as a whole.</p>
   <p class="CHAP_BX2_TXT" id="CHAP_BX2_TXT16">So, by now, you should start to feel much more comfortable with the financial aspects of your business, particularly when talking to members of the finance department – understanding their concerns (primarily not running out of cash!).</p>
   <p class="CHAP_BX2_TXT" id="CHAP_BX2_TXT17">The second half of this book now will focus on the internal finances of the business – the income and the costs that you may come across and how they are treated. When working through the following sections, try to keep in the back of your mind the big picture that we have drawn up so far. Every decision by a line manager has a financial impact; while you might see the impact in the P&amp;L, it will also affect the balance sheet and the cash flow of the business – understanding and appreciating this inter-connectedness of the accounts will allow you to appreciate the challenges of running the business from a financial, as well as operational, perspective to a much greater degree, and therefore be able to make decisions from a more financially aware perspective.</p>
