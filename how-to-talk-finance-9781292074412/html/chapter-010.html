    <p class="CHAP_TXT_1ST_PARA" id="CHAP_TXT_1ST_PARA1">In this book, I have tried to paint the big picture for you, the reader – to help you understand the backdrop against which key financial, commercial (and operational) decisions are made.</p>
    <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT816">We started by looking at how a company is structured and how it trades, before moving on to how a company is funded. Using this knowledge, we were able to examine the three main trading statements and to consider some of the key financial indicators (KFIs) that might be used in running our business or when examining another business. We consolidated this knowledge with a case study – IRU.</p>
    <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT817">In the second half of the book, we started to examine the business in more detail – understanding the different types of costs that you might encounter, how they behave and how they are treated financially. We considered how to build a business case using discounted cash flow.</p>
    <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT818">We finished by pulling together all the information contained in this book and examining what a budget is, how it is put together, and the importance of budgeting and forecasting in running the business. As a final reflection, we considered the concept of commercial awareness and looked at how you can apply what you have learned from this book in your place of work.</p>
    <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT819">In the introduction to this book, I likened the learning of finance to the learning of a new language. If you have got this far (and are still awake!), then congratulations – you have completed the first step towards your fluency in finance. But, remember – it does not stop here!</p>

    <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT820">You should treat your reading so far as a first step, not conclusive in itself. Unless you work in the finance department, or in senior management, finance is unlikely to be part of your day-to-day life – and it is, therefore, very easy to forget the lessons that you have (hopefully) learnt so far in this book.</p>
    <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT821">Use this book as a starting point; obtain copies of the statutory accounts of your own business, your competitors, your suppliers, your clients, etc. See if you can undertake the same analysis that we have done here. What conclusions can you draw?</p>
    <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT822">It is worth making friends with someone in the finance department who can sense check your conclusions – some kind of mentor will be of great assistance.</p>
    <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT823">Finally, remember – finance is not everyone’s favourite discipline. But do not be afraid of the numbers, do not be afraid to ask for help, do not be afraid to say that you do not understand something. Finance is a key skill for anyone looking to develop their career – either with their current organisation or a new one. The financial skills that you pick up will set you in very good stead for the future.</p>
    <p id="p37">Good luck!</p>
