  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H1108"><span class="bold">What is commercial awareness?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT774">In business, commercial awareness has many different interpretations, from understanding the commercials of a contract to how a business is run.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT775">The <span class="Italic">Cambridge Business English Dictionary</span> defines commercial awareness as: ‘the knowledge of how businesses make money; what customers want and what problems there are in a particular area of business.’</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT776">In this book, we will consider commercial awareness to be the application <a id="page276"></a>of financial theory to real life business challenges. The chapters in this book have dealt, where possible, with real life companies and situations, rather than theoretical concepts. But the challenge still exists in applying this knowledge into the workplace on a day-to-day basis.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT777">And so, this final chapter aims to give some guidance on how to leverage the knowledge gained in this book and apply it to your business in a commercial manner.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT778">Most of the concepts covered have focused on the operational application of finance to the day-to-day running of a business. But, just as the day-to-day operations must be aligned to the overall strategic goals of the business, so the application of the financial concepts – or commercial awareness – must also consider the context of the strategy of the business. The first challenge, therefore, is to define what that strategy is.</p>
  <ul id="ul125">
<li id="li252">Take time to reflect on what we have covered so far in this book. How has it changed your understanding of your business?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div185">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H1109"><span class="bold">What is strategy?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT779">Capitalism involves the allocation of a scarce resource – in this case capital (or investment). In order to maximise their chances of success, it is important that companies have a clear vision of what they are trying to achieve – defined as their strategic intent – and are confident that this goal is based on sound financial or commercial principles.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT780">There are many different definitions of strategy, but one of the best is from Johnson and Scholes (Johnson, G., Scholes, K. and Whittington, R. (2007) <span class="Italic">Exploring Corporate Strategy: Text and Cases</span>. UK: Financial Times/Prentice Hall):</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT781"><span class="Italic">‘</span><span class="Italic">Strategy is the </span><span class="bold">direction</span><span class="Italic"> and </span><span class="bold">scope</span><span class="Italic"> of an organisation over the </span><span class="bold">long term</span><span class="Italic"> that achieves an </span><span class="bold">advantage</span><span class="Italic"> for the organisation through the </span><span class="bold">configuration of its resources</span><span class="Italic"> within a </span><span class="bold">changing environment</span><span class="Italic"> to meet the </span><span class="bold">needs of the customers</span><span class="Italic"> and to </span><span class="bold">fulfil stakeholder expectations</span><span class="Italic">.’</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT782">This is a long definition, but the highlighted phrases demonstrate how this <a id="page277"></a>definition provides a comprehensive understanding of strategy and how the finances of the business contribute towards this strategy:</p>
  <ul id="ul126">
<li id="li253">Determining the <span class="bold">direction</span> of the business involves setting the vision of the organisation – i.e. where it is hoping to end up (number one by sales; rated top for customer service; or 80 per cent of the domestic market share, for example). The budget of a company provides the short-term financial implications of this direction and the 5–10-year forecast gives a picture of how the company will look financially over the longer term.</li>
<li id="li254">Whilst <span class="bold">direction</span> is concerned with what the company wants to do and where it wants to go, <span class="bold">scope</span> is concerned with what the company should not do. It is all too easy for a businesses to branch out into all sorts of new products, new services and new markets; successful business are ones that are good at identifying their core competencies – i.e. what they are really good at – and focusing on these. Sound financial analysis (i.e. accurate cost allocation models and realistic business cases) will enable a business to make the correct trade-offs and focus on the more profitable areas of the business.</li>
<li id="li255">Whilst the company may engage in short-term tactics, the overall strategy of the business is focused on the <span class="bold">long-term</span>. It is not about next week, but the next three to five years (or longer). Thus the need for long-term financial forecasting is important to avoid short-term financial mistakes that can prevent a business from continuing as a going concern.</li>
<li id="li256">Any strategy that does not create an <span class="bold">advantage</span> for an organisation is not really a strategy. The strategy must be aimed at creating a competitive advantage that has the potential to be translated into increased profitability.</li>
<li id="li257">A company must create an organisational structure to deliver the strategy – in effect the <span class="bold">configuration of its resources</span>. While companies may compete in the same market place, they will be structured in different ways. This structure creates what Michael Porter called the value chain. The stronger this value chain (i.e. the greater the degree to which the various functions of the business are integrated), the more difficult it will be for competitors to replicate and, hence, a business <a id="page278"></a>can build barriers to entry that prevent other companies competing effectively. This, in turn, creates a <span class="bold">sustained</span> competitive advantage – ongoing profitability. The finance team form part of this value chain but more importantly, so does the culture of an organisation. A business that has a culture of financial discipline, with managers taking responsibility for their budgets and having an appreciation of the financial implications of their operational decisions, will have a greater chance of strategic success.</li>
<li id="li258">The world is a constantly changing place – new technologies, changes in economic circumstances (both domestically and internationally) – and a constantly changing geopolitical world means that companies must recognise that they operate in a <span class="bold">changing environment</span>. They must adapt constantly and innovate just to survive – standing still is not an option. Thus strategy becomes an ever-evolving process – not something that is undertaken once. The financial analysis of a business will help to highlight some of these trends and how they are affecting the business; being able to spot trends in financial data will enable managers to take corrective action sooner rather than later.</li>
<li id="li259">Companies must remain focused on meeting the <span class="bold">needs of their customers</span> and clients. And, just as the company’s environment is changing, so is the environment of your customers. Companies must, therefore, recognise that the needs of their customers will change over time – successful companies are those that are good at recognising this change and anticipating future requirements.</li>
<li id="li260">Finally, the strategy must be able to secure the future of the business and to <span class="bold">fulfil stakeholder expectations</span> – to ensure that the company is a going concern – and it will deliver the profits for the shareholders as well as long-term employment for employees. There are multiple other stakeholders – from the government and regulators to suppliers and financers; all have a vested interest in a successful company that continues to trade profitably long into the future. Techniques such as investment appraisal will assist the company in its ultimate financial aim – to maximise the wealth of the owners (through a combination of dividend income and/or capital growth).</li>
  </ul>
  <ul id="ul127">
<li id="li261">What is the strategy of your organisation?</li>
<li id="li262"><a id="page279"></a>Where will you find it? (Look on your website or in your annual accounts.)</li>
<li id="li263">Do you share your strategy with your stakeholders?</li>
<li class="LIST_LAST_PARA" id="LIST_LAST_PARA31">How important is finance to delivering this strategy?</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT783">So, now we understand what strategy is, we need to examine how the board of directors determines the strategy. In this section, we will consider how strategy is determined with a focus on the financial aspects.</p>
</div>
<div id="div186">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H1110"><span class="bold">How is the strategic direction of a business determined?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT784">There is no hard and fast rule in terms of how the business establishes the overall strategy. Some companies may try a two-week blue-sky thinking executive retreat in Barbados, while others may have to settle for a rain-filled couple of days at a small pub somewhere in the West Country.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT785">The process of establishing the strategic direction might involve addressing some of the following questions.</p>
<div id="div187">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H255"><span class="bold">Where are we now?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT786">Before trying to determine the strategy of an organisation (where do we want to be), a business first should examine where it is right now. This involves examining the current position of the business in relation to the environment in which it operates, and identifying the trends that are taking place. Identifying the trends will help determine where the world is going and will allow the business to make an informed decision on where it wants to be in that new world (i.e. determining the strategy). Remember, the balance sheet provides the ‘where are we now?’ view of the world, while identifying trends in the P&amp;L account and cash flow will help the board to determine how the changes will affect the business in the future.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT787">There are two ways of looking at the business and the world in which it operates – <span class="bold">inside out strategic thinking</span> and <span class="bold">outside in strategic thinking</span>.</p>
<div id="div188">
   <h5 class="CHAP_H3" id="h51"><a id="page280"></a><span class="bold"><span class="Italic">What is inside out strategic thinking?</span></span></h5>
   <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT788">Inside out refers to the process of standing inside the company and looking out at the changing environment in which the business is operating. The aim is to identify the trends that are affecting the world in which your business is operating and then trying to pull those trends together into a multi-dimensional vivid picture of what the future will look like.</p>
   <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT789">A technique for shaping your thinking is to use STEEPLE analysis. STEEPLE stands for:</p>
   <ul id="ul128">
 <li id="li264"><span class="bold">S</span>ocial: what are the social trends affecting, for example, your clients? Individuals are more accepting of the collection of data on their habits, for example, or are changing the way that they communicate through the use of social media. What will be the social norms of the future?</li>
 <li id="li265"><span class="bold">T</span>echnical – the rapid development of technology, from the PC to the smart phone and beyond, has changed the world dramatically. What did people do in an elevator before the advent of the smart phone?</li>
 <li id="li266"><span class="bold">E</span>conomic – the economy moves in cycles and, once in a while, experiences a significant upheaval (such as the financial crisis of 2007–8). Where are we in that economic cycle and what does the future hold?</li>
 <li id="li267"><span class="bold">E</span>nvironmental – global warming and increased awareness of pollution issues have given rise for the need for companies to demonstrate their green credentials. How might these environmental concerns develop in the future?</li>
 <li id="li268"><span class="bold">P</span>olitical – changes in the political landscape can have far-reaching consequences (both good and bad). Companies that operate in countries with less stable governments run an increased risk in choosing to do business there. Where are your key markets and what political changes are taking place there?</li>
 <li id="li269"><span class="bold">L</span>egal – changes in legislation will affect companies; particularly those that operate in highly regulated environments (such as banks and utility companies). How are regulations affecting your business? Are laws becoming tighter or more light touch?</li>
 <li class="LIST_LAST_PARA" id="LIST_LAST_PARA32"><span class="bold">E</span>thical – just as society is changing socially, so its ethical values are changing. What might have been considered ethically acceptable in the <a id="page281"></a>past may no longer be so. What effect do changes, which are considered ethically acceptable, have on your business?</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT790">So, inside out strategic thinking involves looking at the world in which a business is operating and trying to determine what that world is going to look like.</p>
   <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT791">This will allow a business to identify the <span class="bold">opportunities</span> as well as the <span class="bold">threats</span> that the company might face.</p>
   <ul id="ul129">
 <li id="li270">Conduct a STEEPLE analysis for your business. Where do you think your world is heading?</li>
 <li id="li271">What opportunities can you see?</li>
 <li id="li272">What are the threats of which you need to be aware?</li>
 <li id="li273">Now apply this methodology to your personal situation. How does this framework help you think about your career?</li>
   </ul>
</div>
<div id="div189">
   <h5 class="CHAP_H3" id="h52"><span class="bold"><span class="Italic">What is outside in strategic thinking?</span></span></h5>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="pc30"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0281_01.png" width="499" height="301"/>
</div>
   <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT792">Having looked at the world in which a company is operating and identified what that world might look like in the future, a company might then turn to look inwards at itself. A common framework for undertaking this analysis is the use of Porter’s Five Forces:</p>
   <ul id="ul130">
 <li id="li274"><span class="bold">Supplier power</span> – is the business dependent on one or two companies to supply a particular product or component? If there is lack of competition – i.e. alternative suppliers – then a company may be held to ransom. Companies who deal with strong suppliers often see their margins <a id="page282"></a>eroded as they have little bargaining power to drive down costs. Trying to ‘commoditise’ the input will encourage competition from suppliers and thus ensure that your company can gain the best price.</li>
 <li id="li275"><span class="bold">Buyer power</span> – is the business dependent on one or two customers? Again, if so, then they may be able to dictate the terms of business and push (sale) prices down. A business that is overly dependent on one or two customers should look to diversify in order to reduce this dependency. Not only will your customer be able to dictate terms to you, the success of your business will be heavily dependent on their business. If your customers run into financial difficulties, then you could easily see this being passed on to your business.</li>
 <li id="li276"><span class="bold">Threat of new entrants</span> – what is the likelihood that new (or existing) companies will enter the market? Markets with high barriers to entry – such as requiring significant infrastructure investment or brand awareness – are much more difficult to penetrate.</li>
 <li id="li277"><span class="bold">Threat of substitute products</span> – if a customer does not use your product, or a similar product from a competitor, do they have an alternative? If so, what is that alternative?</li>
 <li class="LIST_LAST_PARA" id="LIST_LAST_PARA33"><span class="bold">Existing competition</span> – what is the competition like at the moment in the market place in which you are operating? Do you have an effective monopoly or is there fierce price competition?</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="CHAP_TXT LIST_LAST_PARA" id="LIST_LAST_PARA34">Outside in strategic thinking will allow a company to understand its <span class="bold">strengths</span> and <span class="bold">weaknesses</span>. Remember – what is considered to be a strength or weakness today may not be so in the future.</p>
   <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT793">Thus, the two frameworks should be used in conjunction with one another to produce a SWOT analysis that identifies the strengths (S) and weaknesses (W) of the company and also the opportunities (O) and threats (T) that the future holds.</p>
   <ul id="ul131">
 <li class="LIST_LAST_PARA" id="LIST_LAST_PARA35">Use Porter’s Five Forces to analyse your business. Where do the strengths and weaknesses of the business lie? Consider what you think are your own personal S &amp; W in the light of your personal O &amp; T identified above.</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT794">An understanding of the finances of a business is crucial in performing an outside in analysis. Understanding the accounts of a supplier will enable <a id="page283"></a>you as the buyer to determine whether this is a company with which you want to do business (remember IRU in <a href="chapter-005.html#Chapter5">Chapter 5</a>?). It will also enable you to determine whether they are very price sensitive (see operational gearing in <a href="chapter-004.html#Chapter4">Chapter 4</a>) or can offer a big discount, or perhaps whether or not they have cash flow issues (see liquidity in <a href="chapter-004.html#Chapter4">Chapter 4</a>) and perhaps you can negotiate a discount for early payment of invoices (but only if your own cash flow will allow for this).</p>
   <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT795">Similarly, a sound understanding of your customers’ accounts will increase your confidence to extend credit without having to write off bad debts when it becomes clear that they cannot pay. Where their credit rating may look suspect, you might wish to request payment in advance (remember to treat it as deferred income) or request some other security to minimise the risk of default.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="div190">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H256"><span class="bold">What is the vision of a business?</span></h4>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="pc31"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0283_01.png" width="416" height="263"/>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT796">The senior management of the organisation can then pull these concepts together to determine the vision of the business – in effect, answering the question, ‘Where do I want to be?’ in, say, five to ten years’ time. The vision of the business might be to become the preferred supplier, or achieve a specific level of turnover or market share. A vision should be both ambitious, but also clearly defined, so that the company knows when it has been achieved.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT797">By projecting the finances forward, using the forecasting techniques discussed in <a href="chapter-008.html#Chapter8">Chapter 8</a>, businesses – can build a financial picture of where they hope to be – both in terms of the financial position (shown in the balance sheet) as well as in terms of profitability and cash flow.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT798"><a id="page284"></a>Remember – the quality of the decisions will be only as good as the data on which they are based. A sound understanding of the business from a financial perspective will provide a good idea of what activities are or are not profitable. In <a href="chapter-006.html#Chapter6">Chapter 6</a> we covered the subject of costs in some detail – the accuracy with which these costs are accounted for (into the correct periods, and into the correct cost centres with the right cost codes) and the methodology by which they are allocated to the various activities will provide a clear picture of which areas of the business are operating profitably.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT799">The finance team can achieve only so much in ensuring that the financial data is accurate. Line managers in the business have a greater understanding of what is actually happening at the ‘coal face’ and it is important that this is reflected accurately in the financial data that is provided to the strategic decision makers in the organisation.</p>
<ul id="ul132">
   <li id="li278">What is the vision of your business?</li>
   <li id="li279">What about your personal vision?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="div191">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H257"><span class="bold">What is the difference between the mission and vision of a business?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT800">If the <span class="bold">vision</span> determines where a company wants to be in the future, the <span class="bold">mission</span> identifies what the company does. The distinction is important – the mission (what we do) will stay the same, while the vision (where we want to be) will change.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT801">An effective mission statement is one that stakeholders (employees, but also external stakeholders such as suppliers and clients) can buy into. It should be a reflection of the core values of the business.</p>
<ul id="ul133">
   <li id="li280">What are the core competencies of your organisation?</li>
   <li id="li281">How are they leveraged to create advantage?</li>
   <li id="li282">How do you leverage what you are good at to your advantage?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="div192">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H258"><span class="bold">What is the role of commercial awareness in delivering the strategy?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT802">Once a business has determined where it is and where it wants to be, it can perform a gap analysis to determine the best way to deliver on that strategy. This will involve breaking down the objectives into long- and short-term <a id="page285"></a>goals and working out how to deliver on each milestone – in effect, determining the operational decisions that must be made to move the business forward towards the long-term goals.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT803">As we have seen during the course of this book, every decision by a manager will have a financial implication on the organisation and an appreciation of these financial implications will enable managers to identify areas of concern at an early stage and take corrective action where necessary.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT804">Preparing the budget to achieve each objective and analysing progress against this budget will help to ensure that the business remains on track to deliver the strategy.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT805">A comprehensive budgeting and forecasting process will ensure that managers are able to monitor progress towards the delivery of the organisational strategy. It is also a method of effectively communicating that strategy throughout the business.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT806">Accurate forecasting, based on the historical data, will help the business project into the future and determine whether it is still on track to deliver the financial benefits of the strategy.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT807">Armed with the knowledge of how assets are valued and the various investment appraisal techniques, the identification of additional investment opportunities – from purchasing new machinery to buying a company or expanding overseas – can now be presented in a manner that is both operationally and financially viable. Using discounted cash flow analysis, referring to the company’s cost of capital and comparing the results from various appraisal concepts will demonstrate that operational and strategic proposals have undergone a sound commercial analysis before being proposed.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT808">A thorough understanding of the costs of the business, how they behave and how they are accounted for will increase the accuracy of the decision-making process – allowing visibility of more profitable areas of activity compared with those that are less profitable. Armed with this information, it is possible to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of expanding a business following a high operational gearing model (for example, by buying in additional staff) or a lower operational gearing model (by hiring contract workers to begin with). Both will have different impacts on the risk and return of delivering the strategy.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT809"><a id="page286"></a>Additional investment will have an adverse impact on cash flow – an understanding of the pressures currently on the cash flow of the business will allow the business to make informed decisions. How will the additional investment be funded? If there are insufficient retained earnings, perhaps there is the capacity for additional debt to be taken on. Remembering that, as demonstrated by the WACC (see <a href="chapter-007.html#Chapter7">Chapter 7</a>), there is no such thing as free money. Investment made in one area of the business is investment that cannot be made in another area of the business. An appreciation and acknowledgement of this opportunity cost will again bring commercial weight to any proposal.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT810">Being able to build an effective business model and study the future cash flows associated with the investment will allow managers to assess the risk – or sensitivity – of the plan to changes in assumptions. Again, this will allow for a greater understanding of the risks associated with delivering on the strategy and thereby increase the chances that proposals that demonstrate commercial rigour will be accepted.</p>

<div id="div193">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H1111"><span class="bold">How else can commercial awareness be applied in the workplace?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT811">So far, we have talked about the internal delivery of your business strategy. What about your suppliers? Have you negotiated the best terms? How sensitive are they to changes in price? How reliant are they on future cash flows? Might they offer a discount on price in exchange for earlier payment? We can use the knowledge gained in this book to improve commercial dealings with our suppliers. The checklist in <a href="chapter-005.html#Chapter5">Chapter 5</a> is a good place to start when considering your suppliers from a financial perspective.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT812">And how about our clients? What additional information can we gain about them from their financial reports? Are their profitability margins increasing or decreasing? How secure are they as a business? And how strained is their cash flow? Do we want to align ourselves more closely with them – in terms of a strategic partnership, for example, or does it make more commercial sense to keep them at arm’s length?</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT813">Applying commercial logic, based on the financial knowledge gained in this book, will allow us to make increasingly commercially informed decisions.</p>
<div id="div194">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H259"><a id="page287"></a><span class="bold">What are the implications of getting it wrong?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT814">As we saw in <a href="chapter-005.html#Chapter5">Chapter 5</a>, a company that is expanding rapidly will place additional strain on its cash flow. We often hear of successful businesses that expand too quickly and go bust as a result. Commercial awareness will allow us to reduce the risk of this happening in our business – to apply sound financial logic to the commercial realities that exist in a business.</p>
