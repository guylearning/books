<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT8">Have you ever been in a business meeting and, when the person from the finance team starts talking, you can see everyone’s eyes glaze over (and a few start to lose the will to live)?</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT9">Welcome to <span class="Italic">How To Talk Finance: Getting to grips with the numbers in business</span>.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT10">The fact that you are reading this suggests that:</p>
<ul id="ul1">
<li id="li1">you have picked this book off the shelf at a bookshop and are wondering whether it really is possible to learn finance – a dry subject at the best of times – from a book</li>
<li id="li2">you have purchased the book online and are wondering whether you have just made a big mistake – maybe you should open it in a few places to make it look like it has been read and then put on a shelf to gather dust</li>
<li id="li3"><a id="pagexiv"></a>you have found it lying around and have picked it up just to see how boring a book really can be</li>
<li class="LIST_LAST_PARA" id="LIST_LAST_PARA1">or (maybe) you think that this will be the next ‘number 1 best seller holiday must-read of the year’ and want to get ahead of the crowd.</li>
</ul>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT11">Whatever your reason, I somehow doubt that the latter will score very highly.</p>
<h3 class="FM_H1" id="FM_H11"><span class="bold">Why are you reading this book?</span></h3>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT12">As we have discovered from the likes of Enron, WorldCom and the banking crisis of 2007–8, a sound financial control lies at the heart of a successful business. And yet, many managers in business have a poor understanding of the subject and not only find it difficult to contribute to discussions when financial issues are being addressed, but also they actually feel prevented from doing so due to their lack of confidence in the subject. Understanding finance is, therefore, a crucial skill for managers and anyone looking to progress in the modern workplace.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT13">As we travel through corporate life – from someone who works as a sole trader (for him or herself) to the person who works in a multinational corporation – an understanding of the finances of the business becomes increasingly important as we move up the corporate ladder.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT14">It is possible to leave marketing to the marketers, manufacturing to the manufacturers, buying to procurement, compliance to the legal team and sales to the sellers. But every role will have a direct impact on the finances of the business and understanding this impact is a crucial skill in being able to advance up an organisation.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT15">Managers often will have their first encounter with finance when budget responsibility is thrust upon them – What is a budget? What is the difference between a budget and a forecast? How do I do it? – often with very little formal training or help.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT16">There are many books in the FT Pearson range that will deal with the topics covered in this book in greater detail – from budgeting and forecasting to analysis of accounts. You can see the full list of available titles at <span class="bold"><a href="http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/bookshop">www.pearsoned.co.uk/bookshop</a></span>. But, while other books may deal with <a id="pagexv"></a>specific topics in greater detail, this book aims to give the broad brush big picture of finance.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT17">This book aims to deliver a ‘Ronseal’ promise (you may remember the Ronseal advertisements – ‘It does exactly what it says on the tin’ – well, this book aims to give you ‘exactly what it says on the cover’) an overall big picture of the world of business finance and how companies work financially. You should treat this book as the first building block in your financial education. If, then, you need a greater understanding of any specific element (how to build a budget from scratch, drawing up a business plan or pricing a derivative), you can be comfortable that the basics are in place.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT18">It is probably worth mentioning the scope of this book. This book aims to deal with the finances of a normal company – from a small trading company to a large blue chip. The accounts of banks and insurance companies are considerably more complex and, while many of the concepts contained in this book will be relevant, almost all of the ratios and analysis will not.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT19">In addition, this book focuses on for profit companies with shareholders. Thus while, again, there will be parts that are relevant, it is not focused on the not for profit companies (such as charities) or government sector organisations.</p>
<h3 class="FM_H1" id="FM_H12"><span class="bold">What is accounting?</span></h3>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT20">Let us start this book by defining finance and accounting:</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT21"><span class="Italic">‘</span><span class="Italic">Accounting is the process of identifying, measuring and communicating financial information to permit informed decisions by users of that information.’</span></p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT22">Now, let us be clear here – it is the bean counters (as the finance team are sometimes affectionately known) who are responsible for identifying, measuring and communicating. If you are training to become an accountant – ACA or CIMA or the equivalent – then this book may be useful, but you are probably not the target audience.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT23">It is the managers in the business, who are expected to make informed decisions. They can only make informed decisions if they can read and <a id="pagexvi"></a>understand the information that they are being provided with by the finance team.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT24">Don’t know your P&amp;L from your gross profit? Keep getting your accruals and prepayments muddled up? Still not sure how a company can make a profit and still go bust? Then this book is for you. It will start managers on the road to financial literacy by:</p>
<ul id="ul2">
<li id="li4">helping managers understand the financial implications of their operational decisions</li>
<li id="li5">helping managers read and interpret the financial information provided in the management information reports produced by the finance team</li>
<li id="li6">giving managers the confidence to take the appropriate, informed action, where necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="FM_H1" id="FM_H13"><span class="bold">Can you learn finance from a book?</span></h3>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="pc3"><img alt="Can you learn finance from a book?" src="../images/f00xvi_01.png" width="493" height="423"/>
</div>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT25">Good question. And the answer is definitely ‘yes’, but it is hard work.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT26">Have another look at the earlier definition of finance and accounting. Learning finance is a bit like learning a foreign language. It is very difficult to become fluent in Spanish, Italian or Arabic by rote, learning phrases <a id="pagexvii"></a>from a book – just as it is very difficult to learn finance from a book; but the books are there to help.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT27">So what is the best way to learn a new language? To immerse yourself in the culture – go to Spain and live there, make sure you speak only Spanish and read Spanish newspapers. You will pick up the language quickly. Do you feel embarrassed speaking to a Spanish child who clearly has a greater grasp of the language than you? Of course not – they have been speaking the language for much longer.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT28">Now, you should approach finance in exactly the same way. The members of the finance team have been ‘speaking’ finance for many years. The concept of accruals and prepayments is second nature to them because they are ‘fluent’ in finance. Just as the notes on a sheet of music will ‘sing’ to a competent musician who can read music, so the figures on a balance sheet will ‘sing’ to an accountant (a sad analogy, I know, but bear with me).</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT29">So, use this book as a starting point – not an end in itself. Read each chapter slowly – making sure you understand fully the points being made. Try not to bite off more than you can chew – it is not an Agatha Christie novel – racing to the last page will not tell you who dunnit. Then return to each chapter as necessary – use it as a reference guide to gain, consolidate and retain your knowledge (the Key learning points at the end of each chapter are there to assist you when you revisit the topic). Remember – your undivided attention will pay dividends; it will be worth the time and effort in the long run.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT30">And a final piece of advice: if you are in Spain (learning Spanish) and you hear an unfamiliar word or phrase – what should you do? Ask the person who said it to translate – that way you will learn. In exactly the same way, have the confidence to challenge anyone (particularly from the finance team) who uses terminology with which you are not familiar. Ask them to continue to explain the term or phrase until you <span class="bold">fully</span> get it! Remember – they are meant to be fluent, but you are not. Don’t let them pull the wool over your eyes!</p>
<div class="additional_resources" id="additional_resources1">

<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT31"><img alt="icon" src="../images/icon_02.png" height="46" width="46"/><br/>
In writing this book, I have tried to make everything as simple and as interesting (can finance be interesting?) as possible. Rather than using fictional ‘Sam Smith and his Shipyard’ accounts, I have used the accounts of companies that I hope you have heard of. All of the information in this book is publicly available on websites or at Companies House.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT32">All the accounts of the companies refer to prior years and, in some cases, may appear a little dated. The concepts covered and the learning points will remain the same, but do try to obtain the most recent accounts (try typing ‘[company name] annual report and accounts’ into Google) and see how the figures have changed and what this means for the business.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT33">I have also put together some videos to explain some of the concepts covered. At the time of writing, those listed at the beginning of each chapter are available on YouTube, but others will be added in the future. I hope that you find them useful. They can be found on my website at <span class="bold"><a href="http://www.wainman.net/">www.wainman.net</a></span> (links to the videos can be found at <span class="bold"><a href="http://www.wainman.net/wainman.net/resources.html">www.wainman.net/wainman.net/resources.html</a></span>). If you can’t find something you are looking for, then please do visit the website; alternatively, you are welcome to drop me a line (my email is at the end of this chapter).</p>
</div>
<div class="further_questions" id="further_questions1">
<h3 class="FM_H1" id="h32"><span class="bold">Further questions</span></h3>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT34">During each chapter there are additional questions. There are no right answers to these questions – these are merely further areas for research or questions to provide you with a focus on where to apply your knowledge or increase your understanding of the topic.</p>
</div>
<div class="key_learning_points" id="key_learning_points1">
<h3 class="FM_H1" id="h33"><span class="bold">Key learning points</span></h3>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT35"><img alt="icon" src="../images/icon_2.png" height="44" width="44"/><br/>
A summary of the Key learning points for each chapter is provided at the end of that chapter. This should assist you, should you need to refer back to the contents of a particular chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="next_steps" id="next_steps1">
<h3 class="FM_H1" id="h34"><a id="pagexix"></a><span class="bold">Next steps</span></h3>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT36"><img alt="icon" src="../images/icon_01.png" height="46" width="46"/><br/>
At the end of each chapter there is a short paragraph on next steps. This will contain suggestions on what you should do to consolidate and embed the knowledge that you have gained from reading the chapter.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT37">The next steps, together with your thoughts on the Further questions should help you to apply your newly gained knowledge in a practical way and so improve your financial thinking skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="test_yourself" id="test_yourself1">
<h3 class="FM_H1" id="h35"><span class="bold">Test yourself</span></h3>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT38"><img alt="iocn" src="../images/icon_03.png" height="45" width="46"/><br/>
At the end of each chapter you will find some multiple choice (or, in some cases, multiple guess) questions – designed to assess your understanding of the topics covered in that chapter. You can find the answers to these questions at the back of the book.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="FM_H1" id="h36"><span class="bold">Glossary</span></h3>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT39">Probably the best place for a glossary of financial terms is the Internet (such as <span class="bold"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance</a></span> or <span class="bold"><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/">www.investopedia.com</a></span>). However, I have included a glossary of the terms used in this book that may not appear familiar.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT40">And finally… I do not expect that this book will become the next Harry Potter and fly off the bookshelves, but I do hope that you find the topics covered useful, engaging and interesting. Please do feel free to get in touch regarding any topics covered in this book.</p>
