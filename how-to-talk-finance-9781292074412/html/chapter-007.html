Aim</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT603">An investment by the business is usually undertaken in order to generate money value – measured based on the future income stream that the investment will generate. These assets are valued based on the future income stream that they will deliver.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT604">The aim of this chapter is to build on this concept and examine how the use of discounted cash flow modelling will assist in building a strong business case for investment within the business.</p>

</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT606">Antonia is asked the question: ‘Would you rather have £100 now, or in a year’s time?’ What do you think will be Antonia’s answer?</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT607">Hopefully, you will conclude that now is preferable to a year’s time. Why? Because Antonia can buy more with £100 today than she can in a year’s time (the purchasing power of £100 will be reduced due to inflation); alternatively, Antonia could invest £100 today and see it grow into more than £100 in a year’s time.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT608">The difference between the value of £100 today, and the value of £100 in a year’s time, but expressed in today’s prices, is known as the <span class="bold">time value of money</span>. This is an important concept in building the business case for investment.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT609">This chapter will show you how to build a model in Excel. To gain the most benefit from this chapter, it is advisable to obtain access to a computer, and follow the steps outlined here to building your own model on your PC.</p>

  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H181"><span class="bold">How are assets valued?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT610">When we purchase an asset – or make an investment – we are, in effect, purchasing the future income stream associated with that asset.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT611">Antonia, a manager in A&amp;B Ltd, can now use this to good effect when <a id="page227"></a>preparing a business case for investment that she must put to the board of directors. She has identified an opportunity in the business, which will require an investment of £1 million. This investment is expected to generate additional cash flow (income net of expenses) of £200,000 per year for eight years. She considers year 0 to be now (when the investment is made), with the cash flows being generated at the end of each of the subsequent eight years. Note – this is examining future <span class="bold">cash flows</span>, not future <span class="bold">profit</span>!</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT612">Antonia produces the following model:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2135">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1194"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0227_01.png" width="696" height="74"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT613">Antonia concludes that her investment will generate £200,000 per year for eight years – or £1.6 million in total. For an investment of £1 million, this will leave her with £600,000 of straight profit – a 60 per cent return on her investment. She is feeling very pleased with this proposal and is about to make an appointment to present her case, when she considers the time value of money concept.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT614">Working on the principles already discussed in this chapter, the £200,000 that the investment will generate in year 8 is not worth the same, in today’s money, as the £200,000 that will be generated in year 1.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT615">Somehow, she needs to translate the £200,000 in future years into today’s equivalent. While thinking about how to go about this, she notices a bank outside of her office window – Bertie’s Bank.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT616">Antonia sees that Bertie has a sign in the bank’s window, which offers 5 per cent interest on any money that is deposited with the bank. Antonia starts to wonder to herself – her proposed investment will generate (among other things) a sum of £200,000 in one year’s time. How much must Antonia invest with Bertie today in order to be able to walk into the bank in a year’s time and withdraw £200,000?</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT617"><a id="page228"></a>To answer this, she needs to solve the following equation:</p>
  <p class="CHAP_CENTER" id="CHAP_CENTER7"><span class="bold">Amount invested + interest earned on investment = amount at end of period</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP_CENTER" id="CHAP_CENTER8"><span class="bold">£[invest now] + (£[invest now] × 5%) = £200,000</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT618">This can be expressed as:</p>
  <p class="CHAP_CENTER" id="CHAP_CENTER9"><span class="bold">£[invest now] × 1.05 = £200,000</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT619">So:</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image1195"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/e0228_01.png" width="238" height="54"/>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT620">Thus, the amount to be invested today is £190,476.19; we can check this by multiplying £190,476.19 by the interest rate (1.05).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT621">So, Antonia has now worked out that she could invest £190,000 today into Bertie’s Bank and withdraw £200,000 in a year’s time (we are ignoring tax and risk in this example).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT622">We can simplify the above formula to make the discount rate applicable to any investment amount:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2136">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1196"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/e0228_02.png" width="419" height="72"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT623">Antonia can then express the discount factor as 1/1.05 = 0.9524; this discount factor, when applied to the future cash flow of £200,000, gives a present day value of £190,000:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2137">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1197"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0228_03.png" width="697" height="141"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT624">Thus, Antonia would be <span class="bold">indifferent</span> between receiving £190,000 today, or £100,000 in a year’s time, if her time value of money was 5 per cent.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT625"><a id="page229"></a>Antonia then starts to consider the £200,000 that the project will deliver in year 2. How much would she have to invest in Bertie’s Bank today, to be able to withdraw £200,000 in two years’ time? Again, she can use the above formula, but do not forget that the money is invested for two years – so in year 2 she will not only be earning interest on the original investment, but also earning interest on the interest earned in year 1. This is known as <span class="bold">compounding</span>, and must be reflected in the calculation.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT626">In this case, the equation will be:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2138">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1198"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/e0229_02.png" width="642" height="97"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT627"><span class="bold">This can be expressed as:</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP_CENTER" id="CHAP_CENTER10"><span class="bold">£[invest now] × 1.05 × 1.05 = £200,000</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT628">So:</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image1199"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/e0229_01.png" width="238" height="54"/>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT629">Again, we can simplify the equation by removing the investment element, giving us:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2139">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1200"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/e0229_03.png" width="419" height="72"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT630">The discount factor is 1/1.05<sup>2</sup>, which is 0.9070; this discount factor, when applied to the £200,000 future cash flow, gives a present day value of £181,406.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT631">We can double-check this figure – £181,406 multiplied by 1.05 (invested for the first year at 5 per cent) and then the result multiplied again by 1.05 (invested for the second year at 5 per cent) gives £200,000.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT632"><a id="page230"></a>So, Antonia can now plug the numbers into her business case model:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2140">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1201"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0230_01.png" width="697" height="141"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT633">This tells her that, if she wanted £200,000 from Bertie’s Bank in one year’s time, she would have to invest £190,000 today; if she wanted £200,000 from Bertie’s Bank in two years’ time, then she would have to invest £181,000 today. If she wanted both £200,000 in a year’s time and £200,000 in two years’ time, then she would have to invest £371,000 today (i.e. £190,000 + £181,000).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT634">The formula for year 3 is exactly the same as for year 2, but rather than two lots of interest, she has to account for three lots of interest (i.e. it is £[invest now] × 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.05 = £200,000). She can, therefore, deduce that the bottom section of the discount factor formula is expressed as to the power of the year (given below as ‘n’):</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2141">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1202"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/e0230_02.png" width="419" height="72"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT635">Inputting this formula into an Excel sheet, she uses the following:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2142">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1203"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/e0230_03.png" width="268" height="47"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT636">Antonia can now calculate the present day value of all of the future cash flows associated with her project:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2143">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1204"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0230_04.png" width="697" height="140"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT637"><a id="page231"></a>For example, if she invested £135,000 into Bertie’s Bank today, in eight years’ time it would have turned into £200,000.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT638">Adding all of these amounts up gives a total of £1,292,643; what this means is that, if Antonia walked into Bertie’s Bank today and deposited exactly £1,292,643 and then returned to the bank each year, for eight years, and withdrew exactly £200,000 on each visit, on the last visit at the end of year 8, she would find that there was exactly £200,000 left which, when withdrawn, would leave the account empty.</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2144">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1205"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0231_01.png" width="696" height="157"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT639">Armed with this information, Antonia starts to consider her project again. The original business case requires an investment of £1 million to generate £200,000 every year for eight years. To generate the same future cash flows from Bertie’s Bank would require an investment today of £1,292,643. Antonia would be better off by £292,643 by opting to invest in the project rather than Bertie’s Bank.</p>
  <ul id="ul99">
<li id="li196">What rate of interest can you earn in a bank today?</li>
<li id="li197">Do you think that this is historically high or low?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div151">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H182"><span class="bold">What is the NPV?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT640">The net present value (NPV) is the present day value of all of the future cash flows associated with a project at a given discount rate. So, for Antonia, the NPV of her project is the present day value (£293k) of receiving £200k per year for 8 years at a discount rate of 5%.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT641">Antonia is confident that her proposal will earn the company more than could be earned in Bertie’s Bank. She is about to make an appointment to put her proposal to the board, when she starts to think about the Bank – what if Bertie increases the interest rate that could be earned from 5 per cent to 10 per cent? Would A&amp;B Ltd still be better off investing in her project, or would Bertie’s Bank now be more attractive?</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT642"><a id="page232"></a>Having completed the spreadsheet, it is now relatively easy to rerun the figures using a discount rate of 10 per cent rather than 5 per cent:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2145">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1206"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0232_01.png" width="697" height="223"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT643">If Bertie’s Bank offered an interest rate of 10 per cent, A&amp;B Ltd would still be better off investing in Antonia’s project. The project requires £1 million of investment, while A&amp;B Ltd would need to invest £1,066,985 to generate the same future cash flows from the bank.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT644">Thus, at a 10 per cent discount factor, Antonia’s project will generate a NPV of £66,985. This is telling us that, if using a discount rate of 10 per cent, then Antonia’s project would generate value to the tune of £67k – she is better off investing in the project than she is investing in Bertie’s Bank.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT645">What if Bertie’s Bank offered a 15 per cent interest rate? If this were to happen, then the NPV would turn negative:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2146">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1207"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0232_02.png" width="697" height="290"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT646">In effect, A&amp;B Ltd needs to invest only £897,464 in Bertie’s Bank in order to generate the same future cash flows (£200,000 per year for eight years) <a id="page233"></a>as opposed to Antonia’s £1 million investment proposal. A negative NPV suggests that A&amp;B Ltd would be better off not pursuing Antonia’s project proposal.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT647">So, what would be the rate that Bertie’s Bank must offer for the board of directors of A&amp;B Ltd to be indifferent between investing in Bertie’s Bank and investing in Antonia’s project? We can calculate this using the goal seek function in Excel. We need to change the value of the discount rate in order to result in a nil value for the NPV. In Excel, the ‘set cell’ should contain the NPV; the ‘to value’ should be zero; and the ‘by changing cell’ should be the cell with the discount factor number.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT648">Using this method, we can calculate a discount factor of 12 per cent (or 11.8145 per cent, to be exact), which gives a NPV of zero:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2147">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1208"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0233_01.png" width="697" height="356"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT649">So, if Bertie’s Bank offered an interest rate of 12 per cent (or exactly 11.8145 per cent!), then the board of directors would be <span class="bold">indifferent</span> between investing in the bank and investing in Antonia’s project. In effect, Antonia’s project is the <span class="bold">equivalent</span> of investing in a bank that has an annual interest rate of 12 per cent. So Antonia’s project is said to have an annualised return of 12 per cent (not quite the 60 per cent return that Antonia initially thought she had achieved).</p>
  <ul id="ul100">
<li id="li198">See if you can build an NPV model in Excel on your PC.</li>
<li id="li199">Once calculated, use the NPV function to see if you get the same result.</li>

<li id="li201">How might you adjust this discount rate to reflect the additional risk in, for example, IT projects?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div152">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H183"><span class="bold">What is the IRR?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT650">Antonia’s project shows a return that is the equivalent of investing in Bertie’s Bank when the bank pays a 12 per cent rate of interest.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT651">This annualised return is known as the internal rate of return (IRR). It is, in effect, the annualised equivalent of the rate of return achieved by an internal project.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT652">You can work out the IRR of a project by calculating the NPV for a variety of discount rates and then using interpolation (i.e. working out where the line crosses the x-axis) or by using the goal seek method in Excel.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT653">If you were to plot the NPV (y-axis) for each discount rate (5 per cent, 10 per cent and 15 per cent on the x-axis), then you would have a graph as follows:</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image1209"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/f0234_01.png" width="541" height="299"/>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT654">The internal rate of return is where the line crosses the x-axis (12 per cent).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT655">The internal rate of return is the discount rate that returns a net present value of nil. (Try saying: ‘The IRR is the DCF that returns a NPV of nil’ – now you sound like a fully fledged member of the finance team!)</p>
  <ul id="ul101">
<li id="li202">What do you think is the target IRR in your business?</li>
<li id="li203">Do you think this is high or low?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="div153">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H184"><a id="page235"></a><span class="bold">What discount rate should we use?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT656">Antonia has examined her business proposal using three different discount rates – 5 per cent, 10 per cent and 15 per cent. She has concluded that, by using a rate of under 12 per cent, her project returns a positive net present value (NPV). The project has an internal rate of return (IRR) of 12 per cent – which means that it is the equivalent of investing £1 million in a bank that has a rate of interest of 12 per cent.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT657">But the project is clearly not the same as investing in a bank. Banks will pay much less interest than the project, but provide a more secure cash flow (i.e. it is easier to predict the future interest that Antonia will receive on her bank deposit than it is to predict the future income that Antonia will receive on her project) – the bank is lower risk than the project.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT658">In <a href="chapter-002.html#Chapter2">Chapter 2</a> we were introduced to the relationship between risk and reward. As Antonia’s project is higher risk than a deposit in the bank, she must expect a higher rate of return. So, is 12 per cent high enough?</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT659">Consider the £1 million that Antonia is looking to invest. From where do you think she will get the money? In <a href="chapter-002.html#Chapter2">Chapter 2</a> we examined the source of funding available to business – debt and equity.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT660">Businesses that are funded by debt need to pay interest on that debt. Providers of equity also require a return on their investment (through both dividend income and capital appreciation in the value of their shares – known as total shareholder return, TSR). Thus, capital (debt and equity) comes at a cost. This cost could be considered to be an opportunity cost – the £1 million that is invested in Antonia’s project cannot be invested elsewhere in the business; the investment that could have been made instead of Antonia’s project is known as the opportunity cost.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT661">Companies will use an internal cost of capital when calculating the net present value. This can be viewed either as an internal opportunity cost or as an internal charge to Antonia’s project of investing £1 million – i.e. just as it costs the business to borrow money, so it should also cost Antonia’s project to borrow that money for investment.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT662">The investment in Antonia’s project is going to require a mix of both debt and equity (she will not be able to identify, for each £1 invested, whether it <a id="page236"></a>came from debt or equity), so she will need some way of calculating the cost to her project of borrowing the £1 million. One way of assessing this cost is to calculate the <span class="bold">weighted average cost of capital</span> (WACC).</p>
</div>
<div id="div154">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H185"><span class="bold">What is the WACC?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT663">The WACC represents the cost to a company of raising the funds for investment. However, the WACC recognises that the capital has been provided from two different sources – debt and equity – and the returns that each of the two providers of capital require are different, because the risks associated with debt are different than those of equity.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT664">In <a href="chapter-003.html#Chapter3">Chapter 3</a> we examined the accounts of a number of different businesses, including National Grid. National Grid’s balance sheet looked like this:</p>

</div>
</div>

  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT665">We concluded that National Grid has £47.2 billion of capital invested, sourced from debt (£37 billion) and equity (£10.2 billion).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT666">Let us convert these into round numbers, which are easier to work with. Let us assume that the company has £40 billion of debt and £10 billion of equity – giving £50 billion of capital in total (this is very close to National Grid’s actual figures).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT667">Now let us assume that the cost of borrowing is 5 per cent. The equity investors in National Grid are taking a greater risk, and therefore will demand a higher return. Let us assume that they require a 10 per cent return on their investment.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT668"><a id="page237"></a>We can present the two sources of funding and their required return in a table thus:</p>

</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT669">The debt makes up approximately 80 per cent of National Grid’s capital (£40 billion of debt out of total capital of £50 billion), and 80 per cent of the 5 per cent return required by debt investors is 4 per cent.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT670">The equity makes up approximately 20 per cent of National Grid’s capital (£10 billion of equity out of total capital of £50 billion), and 20 per cent of the 10 per cent return required by equity investors is 2 per cent.</p>

  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT671">So, on a weighted basis, the providers of capital to National Grid – i.e. the investors – require a 6 per cent return on their investment – the WACC.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT672">If Antonia’s project is for National Grid, then she must ensure that her project has an IRR of at least 6 per cent – or, put another way, using a discount rate of 6 per cent, Antonia must ensure that her project returns a positive NPV. In this case, she is creating value for the business.</p>

  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H186"><a id="page238"></a><span class="bold">What is the difference between the WACC and ROCE?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT673">In <a href="chapter-004.html#Chapter4">Chapter 4</a> we undertook some analysis of various accounts, and calculated that the return on capital employed (ROCE), or return on investment, for National Grid, was 11 per cent.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT674">If National Grid has a WACC of 6 per cent and a ROCE of 11 per cent, then it means that National Grid is creating value for its shareholders. The investors require a minimum return of 6 per cent, but National Grid is actually returning 11 per cent.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT675">Does this mean that Antonia’s project, which shows a return of 12 per cent, will get the green light? Not necessarily. There are other factors to consider, such as:</p>
  <ul id="ul103">
<li id="li206">What is the internal target cost of capital for National Grid? The company is returning 11 per cent, but some projects may fall short of the original budget; in order to compensate, other projects will have to over deliver. National Grid may, therefore, set a target cost of capital of, say, 15 per cent in order to ensure that they continue to achieve the 11 per cent. If this is the case, then Antonia’s project may not get the go ahead.</li>
<li id="li207">What is the risk associated with Antonia’s project? The investment may be in new and untried technology – which carries greater than normal risk (you only have to look as far as the experience of the UK Government in implementing new technologies to understand the risk and implications of cost overruns). If Antonia’s project carries a higher than normal degree of risk, then National Grid may demand a higher rate of return (to compensate the company for taking on that risk) and, again, the project may not get the go ahead.</li>
<li id="li208">What is the business strategy? Is the project aligned with the business strategy or is it taking the business in an entirely different direction? If Antonia’s project is for a new flavour of crisps, for example, then National Grid may want to think twice before committing to something that is not part of its core competencies (i.e. what it is good at).</li>

  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H187"><a id="page239"></a><span class="bold">How can we use discounted cash flow analysis to compare various projects?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT676">While Antonia was putting together the business case for her project, three members of her team – Nicky, Christopher and Julia – were also putting together business cases for three alternative projects.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT677">They meet to compare the future cash flows on each of their projects, which are as follows:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2151">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1213"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0239_01.png" width="708" height="318"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT678">You will notice that they are all generating future incomes, but at different times. If we were to rank the three projects based purely on profit, we would conclude that Nicky’s project is the most profitable, followed by Antonia’s project and then Julia’s project. Christopher’s project is the least profitable:</p>
<div class="inline_block" id="inline_block92">
<p class="CHAP_TXT_AD1" id="CHAP_TXT_AD192"><span class="bold">Project comparison</span></p>

<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1214"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0239_02.png" width="500" height="122"/>
</div>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT679">Assume that they all work for National Grid, and that the finance team have informed them that the company’s cost of capital is 8 per cent. What is the NPV on each of the projects? What impact does this have on the ranking? <a id="page240"></a>See if you can work out the answers yourself in a spreadsheet before comparing with the table below:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2153">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1215"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0240_01.png" width="708" height="519"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT680">The ranking has thus changed:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT681">Now Antonia’s project is the most desirable, as it creates the most value, assuming the cost of capital is 8 per cent, while Nicky’s project falls to ranking 3. How does this ranking change as the cost of capital changes (you will have to work this out in a spreadsheet)? The reason for this change in ranking is that the cash flows for each of the three projects are not only different, but they happen at different times (for example, Antonia’s project <a id="page241"></a>is £200,000 per year constantly, but Nicky’s project generates most of its cash at the end of the project timeline).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT682">What is the IRR for each of the projects?</p>

</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT683">Christopher’s project returns the highest rate of return (it required a very low initial investment and so was low in the NPV calculation).</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT684">Our conclusion? All four projects return a positive rate of return, so will get the go ahead (subject to some of the concerns mentioned earlier). If funds are limited, then investment should be made in the order of the IRR ranking – i.e. Christopher’s project should be given priority, followed by Antonia’s project and then Julia’s. If there are any funds still available then they can be allocated to Nicky’s project.</p>

  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT685">Pay back analysis examines the cash flow associated with each project. Imagine that each of the project managers had to borrow (i.e. create an overdraft at the bank) the amount to be invested. In which year would they clear the overdraft and actually see money in the bank? Again, we get a different ranking of the projects:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2156">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1218"><img alt=" illustration" src="../images/t0242_01.png" width="738" height="464"/>
</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT686">Christopher’s project is still the preferred as it breaks even in the second year; Nicky’s project does not break even until the very last year – it is therefore much higher risk as it depends heavily on the ability to accurately predict a significant cash flow in 10 years’ time.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT687">While a business might not use this method for ranking projects, it may use it for selecting which projects are considered. Projects that do not pay back until after, for example, seven years may be deemed too risky – in this case, Nicky’s project would not be considered for investment.</p>

  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT688">The accounting rate of return (ARR) is a simplified method of assessing two or more projects. It does not take into account the time value of money, but is a quicker and easier method of analysing the return expected from an investment.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT689">The ARR formula is:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2157">
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image1219"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/e0243_01.png" width="330" height="64"/>

  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT690">Where:</p>
  <ul id="ul106">
<li id="li213">the average annual profit is the total profit (after deducting depreciation) for the project divided by the number of years; and</li>
<li class="LIST_LAST_PARA" id="LIST_LAST_PARA25">the average cost of investment is the total investment, plus any residual value of the investment, divided by two.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT691">Let us apply the formula to the figures in Antonia’s project:</p>
<div class="CHAP_BX2" id="CHAP_BX2158">

</div>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT692">The original investment is £1,000,000 and, for the time being, we will assume that there is no residual value for the investment (the residual value <a id="page244"></a>is the value of the investment – for example the machinery purchased – at the end of the project). Thus the average cost of investment is £500,000.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT693">The total cash flows for the project are projected to be £1.6 million, which – after deducting the depreciation of £1 million (that is, the investment of £1 million that is written off in totality over the duration of the project) – result in a total profit for the project of £600,000, an average of £75,000 for each of the eight years.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT694">£75,000 average profit divided by £500,000 of average investment gives an ARR of 15 per cent.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT695">Now let us run these figures in respect of each of the other three projects being run by Nicky, Julia and Christopher. In all cases, we will assume that there is no residual value for the investments:</p>

  </ul>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT697">We assumed that there was no residual value to the investments in the above example, but this is often not the case. A piece of machinery or software may well have value beyond the lifetime of the project. How would the above analysis change if, for example, the residual value of each project were £50,000? Let us start off by applying this to the figures for Antonia’s project:</p>

The average annual profit has risen to £81,000 (remember, depreciation is the cost of an asset,<span class="bold"> less its residual value</span>, divided by its useful economic life). The ARR remains at 15 per cent.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT699">Let us see if there is any effect on the other three projects, if we assume that each has a residual value of £50,000:</p>
