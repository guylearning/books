  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H120"><span class="bold">What is the business cycle?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT63">Every company starts off by raising cash. A company – as a separate legal entity (defined in <a href="chapter-001.html#Chapter1">Chapter 1</a>) – must issue at least one share that must have a value; the company must also appoint at least one director to run it.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT64">The company uses the invested cash to buy assets, which in turn are used to trade and to generate a profit, which is then turned into cash. You will remember from <a href="chapter-001.html#Chapter1">Chapter 1 </a>that profit is not the same as cash. What can a company do with that cash? It can either reinvest to buy more assets and therefore generate greater profits in the future or it can return the cash to the shareholders.</p>
  <ul id="ul24">
<li id="li37">What sort of investments does your business undertake to generate future profits?</li>
<li id="li38">Does your business return profits to investors? Or is the profit reinvested?</li>
  </ul>
<div id="div42">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H217"><span class="bold">How does this relate to Arthur and Ben?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT65">In the last chapter, Arthur and Ben set up A&amp;B Ltd and then raised £100 (from themselves!). They used the money to purchase apples (i.e. to buy assets) and then to sell them for a profit. Once they had collected the money owed to them (and paid any outstanding liabilities), they were left with a (in our example rather small) pile of cash.</p>
</div>
<div id="div43">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H218"><span class="bold">What did they do with that cash?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT66">Well, as they did not pay any dividends to themselves, they must have (by definition) reinvested the cash back into the business. In fact, on day two, they could have bought many more apples, especially if they had remembered to take the cash with them.</p>

<div id="div44">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H121"><span class="bold">From where does a company obtain investment?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT67">In the last chapter, Arthur and Ben set up a company (A&amp;B Ltd) by investing £50 each. This type of investment is known as equity. However, there are two primary sources of finance available to a business – debt and equity.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT68">Let us look at debt first.</p>
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image122"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0027_02.png" height="428" width="568"/>
</div>
</div>
<div id="div45">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H122"><span class="bold"><a id="page28"></a>What is debt?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT69">Debt comes in the form of a loan to the business, usually by a bank or similar financial institution. Thus A&amp;B Ltd, rather than raising the equity investment from Arthur and Ben, could have borrowed £100 – from a bank.</p>
<div class="IMAGE1" id="image123"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0028_01.png" height="330" width="568"/>
</div>
<div id="div46">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H219"><span class="bold">What reward does the debt provider receive?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT70">The income or reward to the provider of debt (i.e. the bank) is in the form of <span class="bold">interest</span>. This interest is fixed, which means that it is compulsory and must be paid by the borrower (A&amp;B Ltd). If you are not sure of this point – consider what the reaction of your bank might be if you decided to stop paying the interest on your mortgage…!</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT71">The loan capital, that is the amount that has been borrowed (£100), is also repayable (this might come as news to some people on interest-only mortgages but, yes, they are going to have to repay the original amount borrowed at some point in the future). The amount borrowed may be secured on an asset. This means that, if the company that has borrowed the money cannot repay that loan, then the lender will receive the asset on which the loan has been secured.</p>
</div>
<div id="div47">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H220"><span class="bold"><a id="page29"></a>What is the relationship between risk and return?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT72">So, if a bank lends some money to A&amp;B Ltd, and secures their loan on an asset, then the loan becomes a <span class="bold">lower</span> risk to the bank; as a result, they will accept a <span class="bold">lower</span> rate of interest. This introduces us to the relationship between <span class="bold">risk</span> and <span class="bold">return</span>.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT73">If a lender makes a loan, which is secured on asset (such as a mortgage) then they will accept a lower rate of interest. If a lender makes a loan which is unsecured (such as a credit card) then they will require a much higher rate of interest, to compensate them for the additional amount of risk that they are taking on. ‘Payday lenders’ in the UK make highly risky loans and therefore felt the need to charge in excess of 5,000% interest before this rate was deemed excessive and was capped by the UK government.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT74">Did you know that if you had borrowed £100 from a ‘payday lender’ in the UK and did not make any repayments for 10 years, you would end up owing more than the debt of the United States of America (which, in 2014, owed over $17 trillion). In fact, you would end up owing approximately £55,000,000,000,000,000,000 (that is £55 quintillion or 18 zeros). Of course, payday lenders do not make loans at these rates for 10 years – their business model is based on loans of up to 30 days (a typical loan of £100 at 5% for 30 days would result in a final payment of just under £170). Either way, it is best to repay on time.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT75">Thus, the primary concerns to a lender are:</p>

  <td id="ch02td1" valign="top"><span class="bold">(a)</span></td>
  
  
  <td id="ch02td2" valign="top">Can you afford to pay the interest or ‘service’ the debt?</td>

  <td id="ch02td4" valign="top">Will you be able to repay the capital when it falls due?</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
   </table>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT76">Which of these do you think is the most important?</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT77"><a id="page30"></a>The answer is (a). Why? Well, let us consider a large company such as National Grid. It is quite possible that they will have to repay a $1 billion loan next month. From where do you think National Grid will get $1 billion? Not from income, as this is needed to pay for the day-to-day running costs of the business; nor from selling assets, as it needs these to provide its services. In fact, National Grid is most likely to borrow $1 billion to repay the original $1 billion loan. This is known as rolling over or refinancing. A financial institution will lend $1 billion to National Grid only if it believes that National Grid can service that debt.</p>

<div id="div48">
  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H123"><span class="bold">What is equity?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT78">The other source of finance available to a business is equity. An equity investor buys a share of the business and becomes a part owner. In our example, in <a href="chapter-001.html#Chapter1">Chapter 1</a>, Arthur and Ben are equity owners of A&amp;B Ltd.</p>
<div id="div49">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H221"><span class="bold">What is the reward to the equity provider?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT79">The income that a shareholder receives comes in the form of a <span class="bold">dividend</span>. Who sets the dividend? It is the directors who set the dividend, and not the shareholders. The directors can choose to increase the dividend, reduce the dividend or cancel the dividend altogether. This form of income is, therefore, variable in the eyes of the equity investor (whereas the debt investor sees the interest as fixed, even though it may vary with interest rates).</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT80"><a id="page31"></a>For A&amp;B Ltd, the shareholders – Arthur and Ben – were the directors, so this distinction was blurred; but if you were to buy a share in National Grid, for example, then you would have to accept whatever dividend the directors decided to pay. If you were unhappy with the dividend, then you could always sell your share to someone else. If everyone is unhappy, then they could band together and demand the directors rethink their dividend policy.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT81">The equity capital that has been invested is non-repayable. This means that A&amp;B Ltd does not have to give back the £100 invested by Arthur and Ben until the company goes into liquidation. The company can buy the shares back from the investors (Arthur and Ben) but this is not quite the same thing.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT82">So, consider the following scenario: imagine that you invested $10,000 into Microsoft when it started in 1975; Microsoft did not pay a dividend for the first 28 years – i.e. until 2003; so, in 2002, you are reflecting on the fact that after 27 years you have received no (dividend) income and there is no prospect of receiving your $10,000 back – as Microsoft has no intention of going into liquidation in the foreseeable future. How happy would you be with your investment?</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT83">If you think that you would <span class="bold">not</span> be very happy, you are wrong. Why? Well, while you have received no dividend income and the company is not intending to go into liquidation in the foreseeable future, the reason that you should be exceedingly happy with your investment is that the value of the Microsoft shares that you now own will have risen. So the value of your investment would greatly exceed the $10,000 that you put in originally (so much so, that by now you would probably have retired on your own private yacht somewhere in the Caribbean).</p>
<ul id="ul26">
   <li id="li40">Are the shares of your business publicly traded?</li>
   <li id="li41">If so, what is the share price?</li>
   <li id="li42">How has that price changed over the last 5–10 years?</li>
   <li class="LIST_LAST_PARA" id="LIST_LAST_PARA6">What do you think has caused this change?</li>
</ul>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT84">Who sets the value of Microsoft shares? The answer is the market. If you want to buy a share in Microsoft, it is a relatively straightforward process; you can do it over the Internet these days but it is more fun if you do it on the phone because you get to shout. So, you phone up your stockbroker and you shout, ‘MICROSOFT – BUY! BUY! BUY!’</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT85"><a id="page32"></a>Let us assume that Microsoft is trading on the market at $100 per share. How much of that $100 do you think Microsoft will receive? $100? $90? Less? The answer is nothing. Why? Because when you phone up your stockbroker and shout, ‘MICROSOFT – BUY! BUY! BUY!’, someone somewhere else in the world is phoning up their stockbroker and shouting, ‘MICROSOFT – SELL! SELL! SELL!’. The stockbroker matches the two trades together, deducts their commission, and the shares are exchanged independently of Microsoft.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image125"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0032_01.png" width="477" height="376"/>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT86">This is what is known as a <span class="bold">secondary</span> market transaction. The secondary market is where you and I trade shares between each other. A <span class="bold">primary</span> market transaction is where a company sells its shares for the first time, for example a flotation or an initial public offering (IPO). The existence of the secondary market allows the primary market to function. So you may choose to buy shares in a company that has just listed on the stock exchange because you know that it is very easy to sell their shares again – the investment is said to be very liquid, that is it is very easy to turn into cash. The same is true for companies like BP who have been in public ownership for many years – they are still traded on the secondary market.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT87">This is very important because, if your friend asks you to make an equity investment in his pub you should consider his intentions. If you are making a lifestyle investment because you always wanted to tell your friends that you own a pub with your own barstool and own pint glass then that is fine. But if you are making a financial investment you should consider, ‘what is<a id="page33"></a>the exit strategy?’ to realise your investment before making that investment. Thus it is important to know how to get <span class="bold">out</span> of an equity investment before you get <span class="bold">in</span>.</p>

<div id="div50">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H222"><span class="bold">How much of a company do you need to own?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT88">If you buy a share in Microsoft, you will own a very small proportion of the number of shares in issue, and therefore own a very small part of the company. Each year, as an owner, you will receive the annual report and accounts and will be invited to the annual general meeting (AGM) of the company. However, as a very small (in terms of ownership, not stature) shareholder, you will have very little influence on the company. As you buy more shares, so your influence will increase. If you own over 50 per cent of the shares, ultimately you control the company – you can remove board members if you are unhappy with their performance, and thus, ultimately, you can control the dividend policy of the company.</p>

  <h3 class="CHAP_H1" id="CHAP_H125"><span class="bold"><a id="page34"></a>What are derivatives?</span></h3>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT89">So far in this chapter we have looked at the funding options available to Arthur and Ben and A&amp;B Ltd and have examined the differences between debt and equity.</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT90">This final section is a brief look at derivatives and the role that they play in financing a business.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image127"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0034_01.png" width="663" height="506"/>
</div>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT91">Now, at the first mention of derivatives most people’s eyes glaze over and they rapidly start to lose the will to live, but bear with this section – they are not that complicated once you understand them!</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT92">Let us define a derivative:</p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT93"><span class="Italic">‘</span><span class="Italic">A derivative is a contract between two parties where neither party owns the item being bought or sold.’</span></p>
  <p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT94">Now, if you are looking at that definition and thinking that you are none the wiser, don’t worry. Let us look at a few examples.</p>
<div id="div53">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H223"><span class="bold"><a id="page35"></a>Derivatives – what is a future?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT95">Imagine that Arthur is planning a trip from the USA to Europe in a year’s time. He has discovered that the cost of the trip will be €5,000 and the travel company has given him the option to pay when he arrives in Europe.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT96">Let us assume that the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Euro is $1=€1 (this will make the maths easier!). Arthur therefore works out that the cost of the trip will be $5,000 and this is within his budget – he is happy!</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image128"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0035_01.png" width="480" height="319"/>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT97">But then Arthur gets to thinking – what if the exchange rate changes during the year? What if, in a year’s time, $1 will buy only €0.50? Then the trip will cost him $10,000 and this is outside of his budget, making him very unhappy.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image129"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0035_02.png" width="401" height="61"/>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT98">Arthur could buy the Euros now, but this will tie up cash that he could use for other things in the meantime. So, instead, he purchases a <span class="bold">future</span> from a financial institution, such as a bank.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image130"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0035_03.png" width="558" height="63"/>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT99">A future is the <span class="bold">obligation</span> of Arthur to buy €5,000 for $5,000 in a year’s time. The obligation to buy is known as a call, whereas the obligation to sell is known as a put.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT100"><a id="page36"></a>You will notice that, at the time of sale, neither the bank nor Arthur owns the Euros. The value of the contract is <span class="bold">derived</span> from the underlying exchange rate, and thus is a derivative contract. If Arthur no longer needs the contract (perhaps he has cancelled his trip), he can sell the contract (the pricing of which is too complicated for this book!).</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT101">Meanwhile, the bank has just been on the phone to a Frenchman who is planning to make a trip to the USA and wanted to buy $5,000 for €5,000 in a year’s time. The bank is, therefore, able to hedge the two deals off against each other, thus minimising their exposure to risk.</p>
</div>
<div id="div54">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H224"><span class="bold">Derivatives – what is an option?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT102">So, Arthur is happy that the trip is not going to cost him any more than $5,000; but then he gets to thinking further – what if the exchange rate goes the other way? What if, rather than $1=€0.50, the exchange changes so that $1 will buy €2? Then the trip would have cost him $2,500. But he has entered into a contract with the bank where he <span class="bold">has</span> to buy the Euros from the banks at a $1=€1 rate.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image131"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0036_01.png" width="660" height="261"/>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT103">This will leave him worse off and so he would not be happy. In this case, he might choose to purchase an option from the bank.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT104">An option is the right (as opposed to obligation) to buy (call) or sell (put) at a future point in time. In this case if, in a year’s time, Arthur is better off buying the Euros from the bank, then he will buy them from the bank, and if he is better off buying them from the local travel agent, then he will do this and the contract with the bank will lapse, as it has become worthless.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT105">You will notice that the option involves a significant transfer of risk from Arthur to the bank and so the bank will charge considerably more for this.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image132"><a id="page37"></a><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0037_01.png" width="559" height="62"/>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT106">So we can now see that any company trading internationally in different currencies most likely will use futures and options to manage their exposure to the risk of exchange rate movements. There are many risks in business, and the last thing a company needs is for the exchange rate to mean that the goods that it is purchasing in Country A are now more expensive than the price at which they can be sold in Country B.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT107">So Arthur is now happy that he has managed his exposure to a future exchange rate movement. But then he starts thinking about the airline, which will fly him to Europe. He wants to book his seat today, and the airline must ensure that the price at which it sells all of the seats exceeds the cost of flying the aeroplane to Europe. What do you think is the biggest cost of flying from the USA to Europe for an airline (clue – it is not the bar bill!)?</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT108">The answer is fuel. Now, the airline could nip down to the local petrol station and fill up enough jerry cans with fuel to fill up the aeroplane and then store them at the back of the office for a year until Arthur makes the flight. However, this is not very practical (apart from the smell, Health &amp; Safety would have a few words to say) and anyway – it is the wrong type of fuel! So, instead, the airline may purchase the fuel on the futures and options market. This way they can guarantee how much it will cost them to make the flight, and thus enable them to price the seat.</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image133"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0037_02.png" width="307" height="385"/>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT109"><a id="page38"></a>And so we can see that all commodities are traded on the futures and options markets: hard commodities, such as gold, silver, zinc, copper, steel; and soft commodities such as sugar, coffee, cocoa, wheat, barley and cotton.</p>
</div>
<div id="div55">
<h4 class="CHAP_H2" id="CHAP_H225"><span class="bold">Derivatives – what is a swap?</span></h4>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT110">The final class of derivative is known as a swap.</p>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT111">Arthur has a house that he purchased using a fixed rate mortgage (a fixed rate means that, if interest rates change, the interest on Arthur’s mortgage will not change, but will remain the same). Ben has a house that he purchased using a variable rate mortgage (which means that the interest that he pays on the mortgage will vary in line with interest rates).</p>
<div class="IMAGE_CEN" id="image134"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/f0038_01.png" width="474" height="406"/>
</div>
<p class="CHAP_TXT" id="CHAP_TXT112">For reasons best known to Arthur, he wants a variable rate mortgage and for reasons best known to Ben, he wants a fixed rate mortgage (remember, whenever there is a trade in the market place, there are two sides to the trade – a buyer and a seller).</p>
