<p class="FM_TXT_1ST_PARA" id="FM_TXT_1ST_PARA2"><span class="AUTHOR"><span class="bold">Ted Wainman</span></span> started out with Ernst &amp; Young (EY), where he trained and qualified as an Associate Chartered Accountant (ACA). After six years with EY working with a wide variety of clients, Ted joined JPMorgan and spent a further six years working in investment management. Whilst at JPMorgan, he undertook a company-sponsored MBA in the International Management of Financial Services, from which he graduated with merit at the top of his class.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT4">Since 2003 Ted has been designing, developing and delivering programmes for private sector companies (including blue chips and financial services) across a wide range of business needs. Whether focused on programmes to build awareness and detailed understanding around financial drivers of their business, addressing new operational initiatives or supporting business change, Ted is experienced in working with key stakeholders within the business to construct training programmes that deliver sustained change.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT5">Ted has worked extensively across the UK, as well as mainland Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with a wide range of companies – primarily private or listed – from large blue chips to small family-run outfits, in manufacturing, services and financial services and is experienced in addressing the needs of programmes across varying cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT6">Ted has drawn on his experiences of working with over 170 clients in more than 25 countries to write this book. Finding the common questions that are always asked, Ted has written a book that provides the building blocks to allow managers to fully understand the finances of their business and to develop their commercial acumen.</p>
<p class="FM_TXT" id="FM_TXT7">Not sure about the difference between gross and net margin? Confused between margin and mark up? Muddled between the balance sheet and P&amp;L account? Getting your accruals and prepayments the wrong way round? Not sure what EBTIDA, IRR or the WACC is, or why they are important? Then this book is for you – written in easy-to-understand plain English with practical examples, this book will give you the confidence to talk finance.<a id="pagexii"></a></p>
