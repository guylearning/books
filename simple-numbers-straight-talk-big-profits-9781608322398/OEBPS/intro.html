<p class="noindent">Every business starts with a seed of an idea, but only a few entrepreneurs can visualize the field all the way through harvest, much less through many successive seasons. By seeing beyond the numbers, I have laid out the basic principles that can help entrepreneurs create a realistic vision of their business from the beginning through many bountiful harvests.</p>
<p class="indent">I will share my experience on how to lay a solid foundation to build and manage your business, which is based on hundreds of real businesses, not cocktail party advice. We start with your dual role of key employee <span class="cmitalic">and</span> shareholder and how something so seemingly simple can mess up so many businesses. We then move to learning the connections among profits, cash flow, and the productivity of labor.</p>
<p class="indent">If you feel that your business is sucking the life out of you, you’ll learn why the black hole phase of business exists and how you can get beyond it to smoother sailing. With profitability comes taxes, and I will show you how to fearlessly face the tax monster under your bed. Once you get the broken parts of your business fixed, you need a monitoring system that is simple and constantly pulses the right data at the right time. At this point, you’ll understand the economic value of your business and have a clear vision of whether you should offer stock to partners or employees, sell the business, or keep it healthy and harvest the profits to build your own wealth.</p>
<p class="indent">This book is primarily aimed at business owners from startup to $5 million in revenue. However, you should read this book before you even <a id="page_2"/>start a business. Many of my peers in the Entrepreneurs’ Organization who have a business with revenue beyond $5 million have found the concepts clarifying and valuable.</p>
<p class="indent">I come by the farming references honestly because I was raised on a chicken farm in Northeast Alabama and learned at an early age what I did not want to do for a living! I was fortunate to have worked for great mentors in both public accounting and a bank before I started my own CPA firm, where I focused on helping entrepreneurs see beyond numbers.</p>
<p class="indent">After becoming a member of the Entrepreneurs’ Organization in 2001, I became connected with entrepreneurs from around the world who communicate by sharing experiences instead of theory. As I grew my firm, I learned that sharing stories was a far superior method of communicating how to build a better entrepreneur. It also allowed me to develop and grow my team of new college graduates and fill their heads with fresh ideas without having them unlearn baggage that might hold them back.</p>
<p class="indent">I get to see intimate data from hundreds of businesses that are the basis for the stories and ideas included in this book. I have changed the names and details to protect their identity, but not enough to change the meaning of the data.</p>
<p class="indent">This material was developed from the sessions I have taught for the Entrepreneurs’ Organization chapter learning events and their Accelerator Program for businesses that are not yet large enough to join the Entrepreneurs’ Organization. It is my hope that this book helps you dream farther because you can see farther!</p>
