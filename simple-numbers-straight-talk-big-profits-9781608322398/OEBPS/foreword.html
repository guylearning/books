<p class="noindent">Save yourself a million dollars and read Greg’s book.</p>
<p class="indent">When I launched my business, I grew it from $500,000 to $1 million to $2 million to what was supposed to be $4 million in revenue in 2001; then 9/11 hit and I was days from losing my business (and our family’s home). Not only had I lost a million dollars within eight weeks, all along the way I was dutifully losing money each year—money five of my friends had loaned me—and justifying the losses because I was “investing” in the growth of my business.</p>
<p class="indent">It was then that I became serious about paying myself, improving my margins, and paying back my investors. The first thing I did was heed the advice of my advisors, who kept warning me that my gross margin was too low. So my critical number for 2002 was to raise my gross margin from 43 percent to 55 percent. I also started having my accountant report my cash position to me each day.</p>
<p class="indent">Through a lot of hard work and focus, my team and I did it. And with the increased gross margin came our first profitable year ever, helping me generate enough cash to repay my investors and make good money ever since.</p>
<p class="indent">In this book, Greg has distilled key lessons for making serious money in your business—lessons I had to learn the hard and painful way. One warning: he doesn’t add a lot of fluff to his points. He tells it like it is, starting with the first page. More importantly, he highlights some truths about business I’ve yet to see articulated in any other book on growing a business, starting with the fatal mistake of thinking you’re making a great profit without accounting for a reasonable salary for yourself.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve known Greg for many years, first as a student of mine in the Entrepreneurs’ Organization’s Advanced Business executive program at MIT and today as a colleague and friend who helps firms navigate the challenges of growing a business.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_viii"/>Greg also gives his time to the Accelerator initiative in the Entrepreneurs’ Organization to help firms under $1 million in revenue obtain the necessary escape velocity to surpass the $1 million mark and join the Entrepreneurs’ Organization. And his tips are universal for much, much larger companies.</p>
<p class="indent">Greg has helped hundreds of companies, and he can help yours. He’s that rare accountant who can see beyond the numbers. Tap into his wealth of experience and put it to work in your business.</p>
