<h2><span class="cmbold">THE FOURTEEN-YEAR OVERNIGHT SUCCESS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class="noindent">A few years ago I picked up a new client who had a good business but struggled to get out of debt and be consistently profitable. I told him when we started that I thought he had a good business model and that within eighteen months he would see a world of difference. He took my concepts to heart and the business began to flourish.</p>
<p class="indent">He quickly hit his profit target once he understood how his habit of taking distributions was distorting his pretax profit. Being a sports guy, he easily grasped the concept of the salary cap and started managing labor costs for maximum productivity. Once profits started to roll in, he quickly got the business out of debt and started building toward his core capital target.</p>
<p class="indent">Then came the moment of truth: it was time to pay taxes. He owed more in taxes than ever. He paused, then he realized he had the cash to pay it and there was no need to spend his profits at the end of the year to avoid taxes.</p>
<p class="indent">The next year brought greater profitability, and he was able to distribute enough after-tax profit to get out of debt personally and start building his personal wealth. In his own words, he became a “fourteen-year overnight success.” The potential was there all along, he just needed a better game plan to harness the power of the business model he had conceived.</p>
<p class="indent">The market is a cruel place that sometimes rewards the foolish and punishes the brilliant. The difference, though, is that the foolish <a id="page_176"/>eventually lose their good fortune (unless they wise up) and the brilliant find a way to survive and make it work—even if it takes fourteen years.</p>
<p class="indent">I cannot pick your business model for you, but in this book I have outlined the keys to success that my clients have used to build successful businesses and to grow their personal wealth. If you do not have the time to read the whole book, these are the key concepts I want you to take away and apply to your business:</p>
<ol class="olist1">
<li class="nl">Get owner compensation right and stop playing games with distributions. This concept affects everything in your business, so that’s why I list it first.</li>
<li class="nl">The new breakeven is 10 percent pretax profit. If you allow your business to drop below 10 percent profitability, you are waiting too long to make the necessary changes to keep it healthy.</li>
<li class="nl">Labor efficiency is the key to profitability. Nothing happens in business without human effort. It is not about how many people you have, if they are highly paid, or if they’re lower-wage, entry-level employees. It is about how much productivity (gross profit) you get for every dollar of labor.</li>
<li class="nl">The four forces of cash flow—paying your taxes, repaying debt, reaching your core capital target, and taking profit distributions—are the physics of business. You can defy them temporarily, but they will eventually win.</li>
<li class="nl">Pay your taxes (or set aside the cash to pay them) as you go. Don’t let the IRS be your lender.</li>
<li class="nl">Build a team culture around labor productivity. Communicate your expectations to your team and hold them accountable. Do not expect to use incentive pay as a substitute for leadership and management.</li>
<li class="nl">If you are undercapitalized, look for the capital source that fits you and your business model. The foundational concepts I <a id="page_177"/>have laid out to build your business will also help you and your investors play nicely with each other.</li>
<li class="nl">Establish an effective reporting system and stick to it! Looking at too much data too often can be just as bad as looking at no data at all.</li>
<li class="nl">Understand the economic value of your business so you have a baseline for equity decisions.</li>
<li class="nl">Spend 75 percent of your time looking ahead at what you plan to make happen and 25 percent of your time reviewing actual performance. Keep your forecasts simple so they do not become a burden to update.</li>
</ol>
