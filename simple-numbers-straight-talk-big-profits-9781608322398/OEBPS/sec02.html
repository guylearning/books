<p class="noindent">The six chapters in this section build on the concepts you learned in the first section and take your understanding to a deeper level. You will find the “how to” when it comes to tax management and labor productivity.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll also learn what type of capital you need for your business and the pros and cons of each source of capital. We’ll take a look at the kind of reports you should create and discover the reporting rhythm that makes sense for you. Then you’ll learn how to determine what your business is worth from an economic value approach. This will help you manage the process of adding or removing shareholders in your business, regardless if the currency of exchange is money or effort.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, we discuss the concepts of simplified forecasting to guide your business and discover why forecasting is more effective than budgeting. Most people make forecasting way too complicated, so you’ll learn a methodology to create simple rolling forecasts at least every quarter, if not every month.</p>
