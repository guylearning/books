<h2><span class="cmbold">ECONOMIC VALUE: HOW TO KNOW WHAT YOUR BUSINESS IS WORTH TO YOU</span></h2>
</div>
<p class="epigraph"><span class="cmitalic">A profitable, cash flow–generating business is the best of both worlds; it is valuable to you whether you keep it or sell it.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">You need to know the economic value of your business to know when the business is underperforming and to have a price if you’re thinking about selling it. You’ll try to sell it for the highest possible value, obviously, but knowing the economic value also gives you a chance to decide if you’d rather keep it than sell it. Knowing the economic value is also useful when you offer shares to an employee or ask a partner to come into the business. It helps you decide what the terms should be, such as whether it should be a sweat-equity or cash arrangement.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many different opinions about the best way to determine the economic value of a business. I’ll cover a variety of methods in this chapter, but first I’ll describe my method, which is a blend of the cash flow–generating capacity of the business and the core capital that’s built up in the business to support that income generation. I’ll also describe five elements that contribute to the value of your business. The chapter will conclude with examples of economic valuations of businesses.</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">BLENDED METHOD FOR CALCULATING ECONOMIC VALUE</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">My experience has shown that the economic value of a business is typically based on the last three years of pretax profit plus the equity (assets minus liabilities) in a business. This method is a blend of the earning <a id="page_130"/>capacity of a business and the capitalization of the business. I have found that deals rarely get done at lower value than this, and many times a total sale of the business will yield a higher number because the seller now has a better understanding of what the business is worth whether sold or not.</p>
<h4>50/50 Shareholder Agreements</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the most common situations that require a proper valuation with economic reality is when there are two shareholders and one decides to sell. You need a method that is fair to both the remaining shareholder and the selling shareholder, and it has to be fundable.</p>
<p class="indent">To start with, if I’m going to buy 100 percent of a business, the maximum amount of time that I’m willing to wait to get my money returned to me, net after tax, is around ten years. But the timeline is different with 50/50 shareholder agreements where shareholders have what’s called a <span class="cmitalic">mandatory buy-sell</span>. If I buy out the other shareholder, I want to fund the deal by giving up no more than five years of the after-tax earnings of the business.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s how a mandatory buy-sell works. When one shareholder initiates the 50/50 agreement that’s in place, the price is set. Then the other shareholder gets to choose whether to buy or sell at that price. If I’m a 50/50 shareholder and I want my partner out of the business, I can say, “Fred, I want to buy you out. I’m going to offer you $500,000.” I would immediately lose control of the agreement; Fred could say, “Well, I don’t want to sell, but I accept your offer, and I’ll pay you $500,000.”</p>
<p class="indent">Within that buy-sell, I structure the agreement so the buyer can pay for it over a five-year period. The economic value of the business should be justified during that period. So if I were Fred’s advisor, I’d say that if the business has enough after-tax cash flows, he should pay for the note in five years. This is a good deal, so Fred would want to be the buyer. If the business doesn’t have enough cash flows, then it’s a bad deal, and Fred would want to be the seller. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_131"/>Earlier I said if I were going to buy 100 percent of a business, I’d wait about ten years to get my money back. In a shareholder situation, the buyer is buying only 50 percent, so the transaction should be completed in five years. Contrary to popular opinion, I believe a 50/50 arrangement is one of the best situations in business, in terms of a buy-sell agreement, if it is structured this way.</p>
<p class="indent">Using my blended approach, the valuation is three years of pretax profit plus equity (assets minus liabilities) at the date of valuation. That calculation takes into account not only the economic activity of the business, but also how well it is capitalized. This fits within my philosophy of how a good business should be structured. It is no coincidence that my blended approach for 50 percent of a business almost always comes out to the available after-tax cash flows over five years.</p>
<p class="indent">The company also needs to be debt free to work best in a 50 percent shareholder sale scenario. If you have a stream of pretax profit but you’re sucking all that out through distributions and leaving the company heavily leveraged, you’re eventually going to have a problem. You start creating a drag on the earnings because of all the interest expense you’re paying. However, my blended method of valuation accounts for any debt in the business.</p>
<p class="indent">The other interesting thing about my blended methodology is that when the value is based on the business being fully capitalized as well as profitable, you create an alignment of both the new shareholders and the existing shareholders. They understand that the goal, first and foremost, is to run a profitable company.</p>
<p class="indent">In a lot of the transactions I’ve worked on, the selling shareholder wants to sell at a high value and then strip out the cash and receivables, leaving the buyer with a somewhat questionable economic engine as well as a business that’s been damaged in terms of core capital. Not surprisingly, a lot of those businesses struggle because they needed to have new capital injected right after the initial sale of the business. You have to look at the elements that really make the deal work.</p>
<h4><a id="page_132"/>Economically Balanced Deals</h4>
<p class="noindent">One of my roles as an advisor is to make sure that whomever I represent gets a fair deal and the business still runs as it was intended to. This avoids a scenario where you try to get the maximum value when you sell your business, but if you stretch the value too far, the business will struggle under the new owner. Then the person who bought it will call you and say, “That really didn’t turn out exactly the way you said it would. I think you misled me.” Whether you did or you didn’t is irrelevant because, as you know, anyone can file a lawsuit, and it happens every day. When the dollars are big enough, it doesn’t matter if they’re family members, friends, or your mortal enemies.</p>
<p class="indent">You want to be involved in deals that are economically balanced. The buyers know what they’re getting, and the sellers know they’re getting an accurate representation of the business. If a buyer wants to pay me more than the true economic value of the business, I’m going to say, “This is what you’re buying. I hope you have the capital and the strategy to make it work.” But as long as I’ve disclosed all the data to the buyer, that situation is perfectly fine. Just remember there are fools who overpay for businesses every day, and they will be looking for someone to blame when it goes bad.</p>
<p class="indent">The only time I adjust equity in a valuation is if the business has booked any assets or liabilities that are significantly over- or undervalued. I make the adjustment because that’s either not an asset you can convert to cash or it’s a liability that the business will have to pay someday.</p>
<p class="indent">If a shareholder who has been paid a market-based wage is leaving the business, you’re going to hire somebody with that same wage to come do that person’s job. That doesn’t change the value. The only risk is being unable to find a replacement who has a similar skill set, but you can often find someone who is cheaper and more capable than the selling shareholder. As much as my entrepreneurial clients would like to think they’re special, they’re not. As I’ve said before, I have yet to meet anyone who’s irreplaceable—I include myself in this characterization.</p>
<h3><a id="page_133"/><span class="cmbold">FIVE BASIC ELEMENTS OF VALUE</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">There are five basic elements that combine to drive the profits that are used to establish the value of your business: customers, employees, processes and know-how, core capital, and intellectual property. These elements are the essential drivers of your business because without customers, you have no sales or gross profit. Without employees, you have no one to execute the business strategy. If you have flawed processes, you either can’t serve your customers or you’ll have excess cost and lower profitability. Core capital gives you the financial resources to fund new activity and balance the ups and downs of the business cycle. Intellectual property can give you a competitive advantage and drive your business to an above-average profitability and protect market share.</p>
<p class="indent">Profitability, salary cap management, and the four forces of cash flow, which we talked about in previous chapters, are all contained in these five elements of value. Let’s take a close look at each one:</p>
<ul class="blist">
<li class="bl">Customers: The degree of stickiness of your customers’ relationships to your business makes your business much more valuable. The more you can build customer loyalty—to your business, but not to any one person in your business—the more valuable your business becomes. I have become a big fan of the book <span class="cmitalic">Customer Satisfaction Is Worthless, Customer Loyalty Is Priceless</span> by Jeffrey Gitomer. He drives home the idea that without customers, you do not eat. Without the right customers, you cannot achieve your gross profit targets that will lead to your bottom-line profits.</li>
<li class="bl">Employees: The ability of a business to attract talent, train talent, and develop a functional team is one of the key drivers of business value. As a buyer, I’m going to look at the quality of your team, and because you’re selling and exiting the business, I’m going to determine if the team and culture are going to remain after you’re gone. The right employees doing the right jobs give you labor efficiency that can beat your competition. Labor <a id="page_134"/>efficiency is the number one driver of profitability.</li>
<li class="bl">Processes and know-how: If you’ve figured out a way to do something faster, better, and cheaper, then you’ve added intangible value to your business. I purposely separate this from intellectual property that is protected by patents, copyrights, or trademarks. Think of this as the road map you give your team that helps them win the race every day because they take fewer detours. Processes and know-how take raw <span class="cmitalic">want to</span> labor and makes it even more efficient, which improves profitability even more.</li>
<li class="bl">Core capital: You must have cash in the business. You also need receivables, inventory, and fixed assets. And then you have to consider the liabilities of the business. Did you borrow money? Do you have trade debt from vendors? From that standpoint, your assets net of your liabilities represent the core capital in the business. A business without core capital can miss opportunities, even when it has the other four elements. Remember, starve the cow and all you get is a barbeque dinner!</li>
<li class="bl">Intellectual property: Anything that can be patented, copyrighted, or trademarked is what I refer to as intellectual property. Not every business has this type of value, but many who do have it don’t take the proper steps to protect it. Intellectual property gives you a window of opportunity to achieve above-market profit and increase your business value in the event of a sale.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">I need to caution you about a common distortion of your numbers that comes with intellectual property. Most people want to take amounts paid for intellectual property development, capitalize them, and put them on their balance sheet. Not every research and development project leads to success. If the research and development costs are capitalized and then found not successful, you then have a large worthless asset on your balance sheet that you must write off. In almost every <a id="page_135"/>example where a company tried to capitalize intellectual property development, they looked at it and realized it didn’t work and it would have been better to expense the costs as they were spent. Intellectual property doesn’t really form until somebody from outside the business is willing to pay for it.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s a common example: People who do website development feel the sting of expensing all that research and development. They think they can make their pretax profit look better if they capitalize it. In theory, that’s true, but accounting rules do not allow you to book it that way. Research and development costs are supposed to be expensed as they occur. The buyer gets to book the assets (the intangible rights of software development) when they acquire them. In most cases, you’re better off to just expense the research and development costs, take the hit, and move on.</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">RULE-OF-THUMB CALCULATIONS FOR VALUATION</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">You’ll hear a lot about rule-of-thumb calculations for business value, such as five times EBITDA, one times revenue, two times revenue, and so on. Essentially, every rule-of-thumb calculation has potential problems. At the end of the day, no matter what rule of thumb you use, the value of a business is based on a willing (or desperate) buyer and a willing (or desperate) seller coming to an agreement.</p>
<h4>Multiples of EBITDA</h4>
<p class="noindent">Everyone likes to pick the rule-of-thumb valuation method that fits their circumstances. If I have a business that’s doing $5 million of revenue, but I’ve had no pretax profit or very meager amounts of pretax profit, obviously my business is not going to look very good as a multiple of EBITDA. I’m going to argue that if I could readjust my pretax profit, I’d look better.</p>
<p class="indent">Average buyers significantly overpay for businesses based on historical profitability. In the transactions I’ve been involved in, those buyers <a id="page_136"/>convinced themselves they could save on expenses or grow the business even though the previous owners were unable to do so. But from a cash-flow standpoint, these things rarely make sense, so you have to stick to the cash-flow value.</p>
<p class="indent">When using multiples of EBITDA, the flaws surface when you have a lack of earnings or a distortion of earnings due to incorrect owner salaries or discretionary expenses. Going back to the first chapter where we talked about owners’ salaries, you’ll distort the earnings of your business if you pay yourself too low a wage. You can also potentially distort the earnings of your business by paying yourself too high a wage. And you can distort the earnings of your business by living off the business profits, as we know a lot of small-business owners do.</p>
<h4>Multiple of Sales</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you look at the stock value as a multiple of sales for a publicly traded company, you’ll see that a lot of them have significant multiples—often two, three, four, and five times. We saw crazy numbers—even higher than that—back in the dot-com era.</p>
<p class="indent">There are some practical mathematical reasons to use this method, but you need to understand that a multiple of sales is a really a huge leap of faith because not all sales are created equal. It’s probably the most inaccurate measure because you may have a different profit margin on every dollar of sales that runs through your business. It’s possible they may all be the same, but it depends on the business. You will most likely see high multiples when it is an emerging market and people with money are willing to buy start-ups with hopes of building another Google or Microsoft.</p>
<p class="indent">In a lot of cases, though, here’s what happens: If I have a $5 million business and every dollar of sales brings in the same profit margin, I may have penetrated all of the sales that will give me that profit margin at the $5 million level. If I want to grow to $20 million, my next dollar of sales will have to come in at a lower profit margin, which will dilute my <a id="page_137"/>existing sales. So it becomes a losing proposition at that point. A multiple of sales is probably the weakest of the multiple measures.</p>
<h4>Discounted Projected Cash Flows</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another weak measure is using discounted projected cash flows. When it comes to projections, one of my former partners was always fond of saying, “You know, it’s funny. We always make money on the spreadsheet, but at the end of the year it’s not in the bank account.”</p>
<p class="indent">This happens because everyone has the rosiest outlook for the future. This is largely why my firm has gotten more involved in doing forecasts. We want to add realism to the process rather than let our clients think of every possible good thing that could happen and avoid addressing the business cycles. For instance, you can’t look at history and decide that a recurring dip in income at a particular point in time won’t happen again this year.</p>
<h4>Book Value or Liquidation Value</h4>
<p class="noindent">Book value and liquidation value are really two methods, but I’m combining them here. You use this method when there are net assets in the business but the business isn’t profitable.</p>
<p class="indent">If I’m buying a company, I’m not going to give the current owners any benefit for their stream of profits or lack of profits. I’m going to offer to take over where they’re at right now and pay for the money they have in the business. Then I’ll try to build the business from there. In the current small-business environment, the most common valuation scenario is when there’s a damaged business and its worth is based on its net assets.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re the owner, you might be willing to accept that offer. If you try to liquidate the business to get those values, you’re going to incur more losses; therefore, you’re actually going to get less than if you just handed the keys over to someone else. You’re better off asking the buyer <a id="page_138"/>to pay for your receivables, pay off your payables and bank note, and then walk away happy to be free of an unsuccessful business venture.</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to small businesses, book value is often a negative number. In this situation, you’re actually paying someone to take over. Maybe you have other assets to protect and you want to get out from under the business. It is not uncommon for people in a small business to pay somebody to get them out of the hole. I see this all the time. But you’ll rarely use a book value or liquidation value on the sale of an ongoing business, unless the market is just really horrible, there are no buyers, and it’s a fire-sale situation.</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">EXAMPLES OF ECONOMIC VALUATIONS: THE MATH TELLS AN INTERESTING STORY</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the sections that follow, we will look at two companies, one at 10 percent pretax profit (Company A) and one at 15 percent pretax profit (Company B), each with two shareholders who own 50 percent. Pay attention to the drastic difference between the two companies in the outcome (both in value and distributions) at the end of five years. It really shows why profit matters not only to the ongoing health of your business, but also to the ultimate value of your business over time or in a sale.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at some of the basic math. In exhibit 9.1, Company A had $1 million in revenue in year one, $1.92 million in year two, $2.07 million in year three (it leveled off between years two and three); it jumped a little to $2.85 in year four, and then it hit $3 million in year five.</p>
<p class="indent">In chapter 2, we talked about what happens between $1 million and $5 million. The black hole, remember? The deepest abyss in the black hole is between $2 million and $4 million. Exhibit 9.1 takes a simple approach of 10 percent pretax profit across the board. If the company can manage to make 10 percent every year, that’s great. But you might see some decline in earnings in the fourth and fifth years because they’re in the middle of the black hole.</p>
<p class="imagea"><a id="page_139"/><img alt="image" src="images/t0139-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent">The business is showing 10 percent pretax profit each year, and tax distributions, which are 40 percent of the previous year’s pretax profit, are listed separately to mimic the effect of taxation. You need to know when you are taking distributions for tax purposes and when distributions are profits after all taxes have been paid. Many companies are on the cash basis for taxes, so Company A pays taxes in the year following the profit, which is a good approximation of the actual taxes. In real life, taxes are calculated for each quarter. The timing may be slightly different, but this is fine for illustration purposes.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_140"/>You take a profit distribution only when all of your taxes have been paid and you have money above your core capital target. Company A has two months of operating expenses as their core capital target.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s assume that Company A got started with $50,000 in capital. In the first year, they had 10 percent pretax profit, so that’s $105,000 in net operating income (NOI). Their core capital at the end of the year is $155,000, which is the $50,000 they started with plus $105,000 in pretax profit.</p>
<p class="indent">They haven’t made tax or profit distributions yet, so they are right at their core capital target of $157,500. Keep in mind that their core capital is $155,000, and they made $105,000. That’s a 68 percent return on investment, which is pretty good.</p>
<p class="indent">In Year 2, Company A’s revenue increased to $1.92 million, so at 10 percent pretax profit, that’s $192,000 in NOI. They took a $42,000 tax distribution, which is 40 percent of the previous year’s pretax profit ($105,000 x 0.40). They didn’t take a profit distribution because their core capital at the end of the year was $305,000, and their core capital target was $288,000. They’re not close enough to the target to take a profit distribution. The owners are getting a 63 percent return on investment, and they left it in the company. They’re building core capital by paying taxes on their earnings. The owners would have to sell the company right now to get their return on investment. They might be tempted to take the money out because it seems like that is too much money to leave sitting there, but they resisted the urge. Remember that opportunities happen to those who have cash.</p>
<p class="indent">In Year 3, Company A had $2.07 million of revenue, $207,000 of pretax profit, and they paid $76,800 in taxes on the previous year’s pretax profit ($192,000 x 0.40). Now they get to take a little profit distribution of $17,000, which is the difference between the previous year’s year-end core capital and their core capital target for the previous year ($305,000 − $288,000 = $17,000). In Year 4, they took tax and profit distributions of $190,500 ($82,800 +$107,700). Overall, they got a little bit of a bump in the third year, but it’s really in the fourth and fifth <a id="page_141"/>years that they got good profit distributions, and they made somewhere around a 50 percent return on their investment.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s not based on the value of the company. That’s based on the owners’ investment in the company, which is the sum of the cash they put in plus the earnings they left in after they paid taxes, so the numbers are extremely valid.</p>
<p class="indent">Exhibit 9.2 calculates the fair market value (FMV) of Company A. The calculation begins in Year 5 with $792,000, which is the last three years of NOI. That gives them $613,500 of core capital. This adds up to a FMV before discounts of $1,405,500, which is the economic value of the complete business. In five years, Company A created a cash flow–generating asset worth $1.4 million that started with $50,000 in cash. It took a lot of hard work, and they had to defer the distribution of profits until they were stable, but the owners paid themselves a market-based wage the whole time.</p>
<p class="indent">Under IRS rules, businesses can typically take a 10 to 20 percent discount for lack of marketability and a 10 to 20 percent discount for lack of control. The lack of marketability discount applies when the transaction is for a company that is not publicly traded. The lack of control discount applies when stock is sold to someone who does not own a controlling interest (typically 51 percent). This is the general standard, but some people push the discounts a little higher or lower. As you can see, Company A can use a value of $899,520 if they want to sell shares to an existing employee or bring in someone else. Now they have to make a decision: do they want to sell at that value or at the higher value before discounts are applied?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="cmitalic">Important Note: Resist the urge to give your stock to anyone. My experience with my own firm (and with clients) is that stock starts to have real value only when money changes hands. This may be in the form of a bonus or a true exchange of cash, but you are doing yourself an injustice to give it away unless it is for estate-planning purposes</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Company A can decide which number to use, but essentially the economic value is $1,405,500. The calculations at the bottom of exhibit 9.2</p>
<p class="imagea"><a id="page_142"/><img alt="image" src="images/t0142-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_143"/>(based on year five) show that the multiple of EBITDA is 4.69. That’s in line with the five times EBITDA number that people talk about. As a multiple of sales, though, it’s only 0.47. The FMV is not one times sales because the company is not profitable enough at that level.</p>
<p class="indent">So here’s the kicker. A buyer who looks at how long it would take to pay for Company A, will see that an average payment of $158,400 every year, is 60 percent of the average of Company A’s NOI from the past three years. Remember, the IRS gets 40 percent, so the buyer can’t fund a payment with 100 percent of pretax profit. To make a payment of exactly 60 percent, the buyer needs to be fully capitalized because there is no room to account for a year that doesn’t act according to past history. If the buyer is not fully capitalized or has a drop in future earnings, it will be necessary to either go into debt or inject capital into the business to complete the purchase. For the buyer who purchases Company A for $1,405,000, it would produce $158,400 per year, and at 7 percent interest to finance it, it would take 14.34 years to pay it off.</p>
<p class="indent">Buyers often expect that the business will continue to run well without the previous owners, so a buyer who purchases Company A, expects a return on investment of 49 percent, as shown in exhibit 9.1. But the buyer’s actual return will be somewhere between 20 and 30 percent. Buyer’s need a higher return on investment than that because, more times than not, buyers want to grow the business and then sell it to someone else. Basically, when you buy a business, you have to pay attention to the net after-tax number. The value of the business over time cannot exceed that number unless you have some other reason to think it is worth more.</p>
<p class="indent">Public companies are known for buying businesses that are well above their own cash flow–generating capacity because they don’t have a choice. They look at those of us who start businesses as if we’re biofuel. They don’t have the creativity to generate a lot of new business ideas or launch new markets, so they buy a business. Drug companies and tech companies do it all the time. That’s just one of the reasons they’re willing to pay a number that doesn’t make cash flow–generating sense. In this regard, they need to buy from you more than you need to sell to them.</p>
<p class="imagea"><a id="page_144"/><img alt="image" src="images/t0144-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="imagea"><a id="page_145"/><img alt="image" src="images/t0145-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_146"/>If I have a cash flow–generating business, I don’t need to have a strategic buyer, or an industry buyer, or someone like that. There are people who can spot good businesses and are willing to pay cash for something that generates profits. And there are people who have been able to sacrifice profits today to build a business faster. But there are entrepreneur graveyards filled with people who bought businesses and couldn’t make them work. Build your business on a strong foundation and have profitability all along the way. Then you can sell it to a strategic buyer who will look at it and say, “This is a great business!”</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s turn our attention to Company B, which makes 15 percent pretax profit.</p>
<p class="indent">Over a five-year period, Company B can take $527,350 of after-tax profit distributions. Under the 10 percent scenario, Company A was able to take $209,900. You can see that profitability matters, and it’s huge in terms of the multiplication effect on the company’s ability to make larger distributions and be more valuable!</p>
<h4>50/50 Partner Buyout</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember that in our examples, Companies A and B each have two shareholders who own 50 percent. Assume that one partner wants to buy out the other partner. Exhibit 9.4 shows how a five-year, 50 percent payout looks for Company A and their 10 percent pretax profit.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="images/t0146-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="image2"><a id="page_147"/><img alt="image" src="images/t0147-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent">If we value the business at $1,405,500, that means I have to pay $702,750 to buy my partner out. I’m going to pay that over five years. You can see that my three-year average of pretax profit is $264,000, and after taxes, I can use only $158,400 to make the payment. There’s a shortfall of $12,994.19 between my annual payment ($171,394.19) and $158,400, which creates a variance of 8.2 percent (12,994.19 ÷ 158,400.00). I don’t like to see more than a plus or minus 10 percent variance in either an overage or a shortfall.</p>
<p class="indent">If I really want to stay in the business, I’m not going to be able to take distributions over the next five years. The only time I can take distributions is when I increase my profitability from 10 percent to 15 percent. And getting rid of a partner might help me do that.</p>
<p class="indent">Exhibit 9.5 contrasts this scenario with Company B, which operates at 15 percent pretax profit.</p>
<p class="imagea"><a id="page_148"/><img alt="image" src="images/t0148-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent">Compare the variance for Companies A and B. With 15 percent pretax profit, the variance for Company B swings in the opposite direction. It has an <span class="cmitalic">excess</span> of $9,470.74. But in this particular case, because the company is already at 15 percent profitability and I’m looking at buying out my partner, I’d probably be a little more cautious just to make sure this buyout is really going to work. I don’t have as much room to grow the company’s profitability when it’s already at 15 percent. This might be a case where I want to talk about it a little bit. But there again, it’s still very close to being a deal where I’m willing to take all my after-tax profits to buy out my partner.</p>
<h3><a id="page_149"/><span class="cmbold">COMPARING OUTCOMES AT 5 PERCENT, 10 PERCENT, AND 15 PERCENT</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">We looked in-depth at Company A, which gets 10 percent pretax profit, and Company B, which gets 15 percent pretax profit. We saw how their fair market values compare and what a 50/50 partner buyout would look like for each company. Now let’s backtrack and see what happens with a company that gets only 5 percent pretax profit. Exhibit 9.6 shows the FMV calculations for this business.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that this business is not even close to its core capital target until the fifth year. This is why you have to be profitable from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="indent">Take a look at exhibit 9.7, which shows the profit distributions for the company that gets 5 percent pretax profit, as well as Company A (10 percent pretax profit) and Company B (15 percent pretax profit) from our previous discussion.</p>
<p class="indent">In the data below the graph, you can see that if you make only 5 percent a year, it takes you five years to get to your core capital target, and you get no distributions. At the 10 percent level, you get meager distributions through the third year, and you get some decent distributions in Years 4 and 5. At the 15 percent level, you get good distributions, but even then you don’t get distributions in the first two years.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, let’s look at exhibit 9.8, which is a graph of the company values.</p>
<p class="indent">The 5 percent company started with a business that was slightly over $200,000 in value and ended with a business that was over $800,000 in value, but they don’t have any cash flow to show for it. This assumes, of course, that the owners were taking market-based wages the whole time. If they had pushed a little harder and gotten to 10 percent, their business would have been valued at $1.4 million. And take a look at the value for 15 percent—over $1.8 million!</p>

<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="images/f0152-02.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent">Some of these exhibits have shown profit distributions, so let’s take a look at the graph in exhibit 9.9, which shows value plus distributions.</p>
<p class="figcap"><a id="page_153"/><span class="cmbold">Exhibit 9.9: Value Plus Distributions</span></p>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="images/f0153-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent">You can see that the value of the 5 percent business is still $832,700, but the value of the 15 percent business is almost $2.4 million—three times as much! Also, notice the slope of the 15 percent curve. It rises faster than the other curves. Obviously, you have to start pushing and get your business to 15 percent profitability.</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">EXAMPLE: SALE OF STOCK TO A KEY EMPLOYEE</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, let’s look at an example of a shareholder sale in exhibit 9.10.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say I have a million shares of stock in the company, and I sell 10 percent of the stock to an employee in Year 1 based on that value. I sell the stock at the discounted value of $43,520. Keep in mind that I either have to withhold taxes from that or the employee has to pay the taxes. Remember, if you can’t get buyers to pay cash or justify it as part of their market-based wage, you are just being charitable. This is the same concept we discussed in chapter 7 when we were trying to get Patrick to buy stock instead of taking the net pay from his bonus.</p>
<p class="indent">If the employee holds their stock until the company is sold, they’re going to get at least the FMV before discounts because everybody goes</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="page_154"/><img alt="image" src="images/t0154-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="image2"><a id="page_155"/><img alt="image" src="images/t0155-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_156"/>out as co-shareholders. But if the employee leaves before anybody else, you will owe them for their stock, and you will have to buy it back. I believe that the buy-sell of a less-than-50-percent shareholder has to be based on the FMV <span class="cmitalic">after</span> the discounts are applied.</p>
<p class="indent">I also believe that the buy-sell needs to occur over a five-year payout period. One of the best examples of all time is Outback Steakhouse. I was told at a conference (by the CEO at that time) that store managers who sell their 10 percent ownership of their store have to wait two years, and then they’re paid out over a five-year period based on a formula.</p>
<p class="indent">You can come up with all kinds of formulas, but if you have a 10 percent shareholder, you can say, “If you want to leave early, we owe you for your stock because you paid for it and it’s worth whatever the math says it’s worth.” In this example, the employee bought the stock for $43,520, and the internal value in Year 5 is actually $119,728. If the 10 percent owner leaves before the whole company is sold, I contend they should never get more than the discounted value.</p>
<p class="indent">If the whole company is sold in the fifth year, you’ll pay the employee $187,075 for the stock they bought for $43,520, assuming the company sells for at least its economic value (the employee will get whatever their ratable share is in an overall sale). Only in the total sale of the company does the minority shareholder get an undiscounted value.</p>
<p class="indent">These deals fail when the cash flow does not match the promises you’ve made and it forces you into selling the complete business to follow through on the promise! You should never structure a shareholder transaction promise that requires the sale of the business to complete the transaction. This is what I refer to as the <span class="cmitalic">last one out loses</span> scenario.</p>
<p class="indent">When I do this analysis with someone, I make sure they understand they’re never going to buy out a partner, and both partners have to decide to sell the business. That’s the only way you’re going to get out. Also realize there are times in the market when there’s no appetite to buy a complete business. This is especially true for a business that’s worth less than $5 million.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_157"/>There is a fragmented market of willing buyers for businesses that are valued at less than $10 million, and the market gets more fragmented as the businesses get smaller. There are plenty of times when there aren’t buyers at higher dollar levels, either, but even in today’s economy there’s plenty of money available to buy businesses. Now more than ever, buyers are focusing on businesses that have cash-flow-generating capacity.</p>
