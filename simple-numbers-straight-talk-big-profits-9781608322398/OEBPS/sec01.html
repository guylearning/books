<p class="noindent">The four chapters in this section outline the solutions to the main recurring problems I see in businesses that are between startup and $5 million in revenue. It is important to review these chapters in sequence since the concepts build on each other.</p>
<p class="indent">You must get owner compensation right to know what your true pretax profit is. Once you know your true profit, you can set your sights on the correct target.</p>
<p class="indent">When you know what you are aiming for, you must establish an understanding of how to manage labor productivity to meet your goals. As you become more profitable, prioritization of your cash flow becomes a strategic endeavor instead of a fire drill with no exits.</p>
<p class="indent">Anyone can understand these concepts, regardless of their understanding of finances or their educational background. Most of these ideas came from studying successful entrepreneurs who have never gone to college, much less taken an accounting class.</p>
<p class="indent">Above all, keep it simple!</p>
