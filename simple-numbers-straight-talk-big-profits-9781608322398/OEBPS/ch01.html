<h2><span class="cmbold">OWNER’S SALARY: WHY YOUR SALARY AND DISTRIBUTIONS ARE FOGGING YOUR VIEW OF NET INCOME</span></h2>
</div>
<p class="epigraph"><span class="cmitalic">It’s my company—why can’t I pay myself whatever I please?</span></p>
<p class="noindent">I’ve always felt that accountants make finances too hard to understand. In my practice, we look at numbers in a simplified way and use entrepreneur speak to simplify the concepts. This seems natural since we’re entrepreneurs ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">When I started brainstorming for this book, I was stunned when I realized that I had never seen my first key topic discussed in any book about entrepreneurial success. That topic is the owner’s salary. It’s a tremendously important concept, but entrepreneurs often misunderstand the relationship between their salary and the return on what they own. In fact, all of my clients have confused the profits of their business with their salary. Remember this key distinction: You get paid a salary for what you do, and you get a return on what you own.</p>
<p class="indent">Why is this so important? Because when you don’t pay yourself a market-based wage, your net income number is lying to you. Or rather, you are lying to yourself. Until you pay yourself a market-based wage and plug that number into your financials (a number that’s reasonable—not too high or too low), your financial data is worthless. It’s like having a compass that’s five degrees off in every direction. If you don’t include a realistic wage for yourself in your financials, your business will always head in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="indent">Deciding on an appropriate wage for yourself is really a key building <a id="page_6"/>block for your business. As we’ll see, it will help clarify a lot of other issues. But don’t just take my word for it. Occasionally, I’ll use actual questions and answers from the entrepreneur classes I teach to illustrate key points, like the following exchange:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Entrepreneur: <span class="cmitalic">Can you give me an example of how paying yourself a below-market salary distorts financial numbers?</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">Greg: <span class="cmitalic">A great example involves one of my clients. They are a couple and co-owners in a business. They were patting themselves on the back because they were making a net income that was more than 20 percent of sales. Or at least they thought they were. Unfortunately they were paying themselves a very small salary and taking distributions out of the business. After I added their salaries and distributions together and treated this number as if it were a true market-based wage, they were actually only making 5 percent before taxes.</span></p>
<p class="indent">This happens constantly in businesses. Most entrepreneurs think they are overpaying themselves, but at least 90 percent are <span class="cmitalic">underpaying</span> themselves. I think this is common because entrepreneurs want to show off their peacock feathers in public, and they use sales numbers and net income for their first extravagant display. But sales figures and net income are irrelevant if business owners don’t include a true market-based wage in their financials. As the old saying goes, “Sales are for show, profits are for dough!” That’s why so much of the data in the marketplace—whether it is industry data or comparative data among other industries—is worthless. Until you apply the market-based wage filter across that data, none of it is relevant.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’ve been in business for yourself for a long time, you receive a Social Security wage statement either once a year or every two years (depending on your age). Look at that statement, because it tells you <a id="page_7"/>what your W2 earnings totals have been over time and what your estimated Social Security payments will be when you retire. This can be a very sobering thing if you decided that you would make low wages and distribute the profits of the business to yourself.</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">KEEPING UNCLE SAM HAPPY MAY BE YOUR BEST KEY INDICATOR</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">No one wants to mess with the IRS. When you don’t pay yourself a market-based wage, your financials are distorted, and the IRS takes notice. How is that?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, if your company is an S corporation, it’s a bad plan to pay low wages to avoid payroll taxes. This practice is on the IRS’s list of Dirty Dozen tax scams, and they look for it when they review your tax return. If you pay yourself wages that are too low, you run a high risk of an IRS audit. During the past two years they’ve audited the returns of thirty thousand S corporations based on this one issue.</p>
<p class="indent">I understand that everyone hates to pay taxes. Too often people use taxes as their excuse for bad performance and say, “I made money, but then I had to pay it all in taxes.” Even if they are making money, some business owners will do anything to avoid paying money to the IRS, even if it hurts their business.</p>
<p class="indent">There is never a case in which the entire next dollar of profit goes to taxes. The top federal tax bracket is 35 percent, so you keep 65 cents on every dollar (before state taxes), and that’s a lot better than nothing. If your company is an LLC, all of your profits are subject to employment taxes so the IRS does not care how much you take in salary or distributions. But if your company is an S corporation, this is a red flag because the IRS will say the distributions should be salary. Either way, you’re taking income out of the business and decreasing profits that need to be left in the business to keep it healthy.</p>
<p class="indent">One thing I say to my clients all the time is that if you’re not paying taxes, there are only two possibilities: You didn’t make any income or <a id="page_8"/>you’re cheating. Paying taxes is a good thing. The higher your tax bill, the better your business is doing. This is your number one key performance indicator. You can’t create legitimate wealth from an operating business unless you pay taxes. Your business’s number one key performance indicator is this: <span class="cmitalic">How big a check did you write to the IRS this year?</span> If you’re my client and I’ve done my job, I can show you how much more money you made even though you paid taxes. I have clients who paid $1 million in taxes, and I was able to show them that they still kept $2 million. A million-dollar tax bill is no fun, but these clients created true wealth that could be traced to real money in the bank. Beware of people who promise to lower your tax bill to 10 percent or less. They are using the <span class="cmitalic">effective tax rate</span> as a lure to have you spend all your profits to lower your tax bill. The effective tax rate refers to the amount of tax you paid divided by your total income before deductions. Beware when people explain taxes this way, because they are luring you into spending money on deductions as a way to lower your tax bill. You will pay less in taxes, but you will never build any wealth.</p>
<p class="indent">This is probably different from what you’re used to hearing from most accountants because they tell you how to save on taxes. But if I’m saving you taxes because you spent your profit, am I really saving you anything? Don’t focus so hard on not paying taxes. Focus instead on increasing your profits. Of course, you have to plan carefully for taxes when you pay yourself a market-based wage. I’ll talk about this in more detail in chapter 5, “Taming the Tax Monster Under Your Bed: Tax Management That Works.”</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">DETERMINING A MARKET-BASED WAGE</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">You have to determine your market-based wage before you can plug it into your financials. One of the greatest quotes I’ve ever heard is, “A man who aims at nothing hits it with amazing accuracy.” I’ll help you figure out how to take aim with your salary calculation and hit the target.</p>
<p class="indent">As I go from city to city talking to entrepreneurs, I encounter an <a id="page_9"/>amazing consensus that $30,000 is the acceptable owner’s salary. Why is $30,000 the magic number? I have no idea, but it is far too low for the vast majority of business owners. One of my clients was paying himself a $30,000 salary and taking large distributions. I recognized this as a problem and immediately advised him to change his pay. A short time later, he received notice from the IRS that he was being audited for unreasonable compensation. This salary doesn’t fly unless you really are doing a job that’s worth only $30,000, in which case you’d better have some salary surveys to prove it. This situation can become very expensive if you end up having to deal with the IRS. And if your job is worth only $30,000, why are you doing it? No entrepreneurs I know truly believe their work is worth only $30,000.</p>
<p class="indent">Determining what your salary should be is confusing to many entrepreneurs. Here’s a common question I hear:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Entrepreneur: <span class="cmitalic">You said $30,000 is kind of a magic number. If I’m paying myself that wage now, how do I determine if it really should be higher?</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">Greg: <span class="cmitalic">Think of it like this: If you got run over by a bus today and your heirs decided they would keep the business going in your absence, what would they have to pay someone to do your job?</span></p>
<p class="indent">There are plenty of salary survey websites. Some of the numbers might be overinflated, even if you knock them back 10 to 20 percent. But even after adjusting them, it’s likely that the numbers will still be significantly higher than what you’re paying yourself today. My practice subscribes to the Economic Research Institute’s Salary Survey Assessor (<a href="http://www.erieri.com">www.erieri.com</a>). It is one of the main salary survey sites, and it’s the engine for most salary surveys. I’ve always been able to find a relevant salary survey to give clients some direction without much difficulty. Another website to check out is <a href="http://www.Salary.com">Salary.com</a>. We’ll discuss other ways to determine your market-based wage in chapter 6, “How to Maximize Your Labor Productivity.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_10"/>Because my practice has worked with so many companies in so many industries, we have a pretty good idea of what a CEO should get paid. If you’re doing $1 million in revenue, it’s unlikely that you’ll make $200,000 as the CEO. We typically look at ranges to determine a CEO’s salary. You probably have one or two people in four or five key functional roles in your business, so you should take a blended approach to setting salary levels. A great example of this is a business where the CEO is also responsible for sales. The CEO function of a business with $1 million of revenue is not a full-time role and accounts for only 20 percent of the owner’s time. The remainder of the owner’s time is spent on sales. If the owner takes a salary of $125,000 per year, $25,000 is the CEO salary, and $100,000 is the VP of sales salary. You can see the problem that arises when the CEO decides to hire a VP of sales. The CEO would have to take a salary cut. The solution is that the CEO continues to sell along with the VP of sales, and the business grows faster so it can eventually justify a full-time CEO. In a single-shareholder business, there are times when the shareholder can decide not to take a market-based wage and remain within the IRS guidelines of reasonable pay. But I still believe the profit card should always trump a tax strategy.</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">A BUSINESS IS LIKE A COW</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Most people know they’ve actively avoided the issue of paying themselves a market-based wage. But increasing their pay sometimes leads to another question: I really should be making $100,000, but what should I do if I can only <span class="cmitalic">afford</span> to pay myself $30,000? If you’re not able to pay yourself a market-based wage so you can see the true metrics of your business, you’re operating at a loss. You can’t let this phase go on too long because you will eventually face two bad scenarios: a below-market wage and no return on your investment. You need to devise a plan that will deliver you a market-based salary and a good return on your investment.</p>
<p class="indent">In the next chapter, I’ll talk about how to fix an underperforming <a id="page_11"/>business. But for now, it’s important to understand that if you are underpaying yourself, your business is sick. I like to say that a business is like a cow. Until you pay yourself a market-based wage—and make a profit on top of that—you have a sick cow on your hands. Your goal is to keep the cow healthy so you can milk it every day. Or you can have one barbecue. Take your pick. In other words, your goal should be to create a business that generates income for you every day rather than killing your business by taking out too much income at one time. But don’t worry—I’ll show you how to keep your business (your cash cow) healthy.</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">SWEAT EQUITY</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">You shouldn’t pay yourself a market-based salary when your business can’t afford it. There’s a different way to pay yourself what you are worth without taking cash out of the business. It’s called <span class="cmitalic">sweat equity</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Sweat equity is the value you have created for your business through your unpaid work. If your business should be paying you $100,000 per year for the job you perform in your business, and it takes you two years before you can draw your salary, you have just created $200,000 in capital through sweat equity. This is a very important concept, whether you have outside investors or not, because it lets you calculate your lost opportunity to earn market-based wages had you chosen to work elsewhere. If you have outside investors, it gives you a way to balance the worth of your effort with the money they invested. Either way, it’s a great opportunity to understand the difference between “I’m still putting in sweat equity and I’m not going to stop until I get my full salary” and “I’ve made an acceptable profit above my salary by calculating my real sweat equity!”</p>
<p class="indent">You can track your sweat equity and make an adjustment when it comes time to do your tax return so it doesn’t distort your numbers. Or you can calculate it separately in your financial performance metrics. I’ve found that most accounting systems really struggle to give you the financial reporting you need for special items like tracking sweat equity. Most <a id="page_12"/>of the time, you need to take data from an accounting system and put it in a format that makes it readable. You’ll find some examples on my website, <a href="http://www.seeingbeyondnumbers.com">www.seeingbeyondnumbers.com</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">MARKET-BASED WAGES FOR ALL</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Now is a good time to talk about market forces in relation to this question:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Entrepreneur: <span class="cmitalic">Does the market-based wage apply only to you as a shareholder, or does it apply to affiliates as well?</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">Greg: <span class="cmitalic">Market-based wages apply to everybody, not just the shareholder.</span></p>
<p class="indent">If I hire an employee at below-market rate, market forces dictate that I’m not going to keep that person forever, and replacement will be more costly in the long run than hiring that employee at the market rate. A high turnover rate is very, very expensive. It also makes it hard to create consistency in the workplace, which can lower productivity, service quality, and customer satisfaction (this is also expensive). If you’re a multi-shareholder company, market-based wages can become a real issue. Here’s a scenario I’ve seen many times. Three guys have been buddies forever, and they’re ready to start a business:</p>
<p class="blockquote">First buddy: <span class="cmitalic">Okay, there are three of us starting this business.</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">Greg: <span class="cmitalic">Sounds great. What’s the ownership going to be?</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">Second buddy: <span class="cmitalic">Oh, it’s one-third each.</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">Greg: <span class="cmitalic">Really? Is everybody going to put in the same amount of money?</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">Third buddy: <span class="cmitalic">Well, two of us are going to put in a little bit of money, but Bob’s not going to put in any money.</span></p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_13"/><span class="cmitalic">But we really need him to be part of the business.</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">Greg: <span class="cmitalic">So what’s the compensation structure?</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">All the buddies: <span class="cmitalic">We’re all going to make the same salary.</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">Greg: <span class="cmitalic">Really? I have news for you: fair does not mean equal.</span></p>
<p class="indent">I’ve rarely seen two people worth exactly the same amount of money. I’ve never seen three people worth the same amount of money. A lot of people find themselves in this situation, and they ask me how to fix it. I tell them they need to have an honest and frank discussion. A lot of times, I mediate these situations, or if there’s somebody else in the business who is respected by all the parties, that person will mediate. The people who have this discussion in the early stages of business formation are the ones who succeed. The CEO should usually be the highest paid salaried employee in the business. There are only two positions that might get a higher salary than the CEO. One is a salesperson who’s on an eat-what-you-kill incentive program. The other is an expert technical person who gets a high salary at the early stage of the business when you have to build the whole business off of that person’s technical skill set. You might give the technical expert some ownership just for the sake of it, but you’re really leveraging that person’s technical ability with your ability to be an entrepreneur. When you have just one technical person who is an expert (and not the CEO) the business is not vibrant enough to pay the CEO more than the expert. Once you have multiple experts on staff and support people, the CEO has a much larger enterprise and can justify the largest salary.</p>
<p class="indent">There is another major problem with three friends setting up a business and proposing to be paid an equal salary. No one is the leader. Management by committee is an absolute failure as a business model. <span class="cmitalic">There has to be a clear leader even if the stock ownership is equal.</span> If no one is seen as the clear leader and director of the business, it will stagnate very quickly because you won’t have a focused leader saying, “Here’s the way <a id="page_14"/>forward. You guys follow me!” You may want to answer salary and leadership questions over a period of time, but you need to make these tough decisions within a couple of years. The success of your business depends on it. Sometimes multiple shareholders have different needs when it comes to salaries. Here’s another common scenario:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Entrepreneur: <span class="cmitalic">I have a partner and only one of us is taking home a salary because my partner can afford not to. What do we do about straightening out this problem?</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">Greg: <span class="cmitalic">When you’re in a situation where you’ve got two shareholders and there’s not enough profit for everybody to make a market-based wage, you need to account for it as debt as the unpaid salary builds up or as an accrued salary that wasn’t paid. If you don’t use either of these approaches, there has to be a shift in equity ownership.</span></p>
<p class="indent">I like the sweat equity solution. Maybe you do it in two phases. You start out with a debt up to a predetermined point, and when the debt reaches that point, you make some equity changes. I’ve done this in my own business when some of the partners couldn’t go without compensation. We adjusted the equity based on who could go without a wage and who couldn’t.</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">GOT INVESTORS? QUANTIFY EVERYTHING</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes having an outside investor makes owners think twice about paying themselves a market-based salary:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Entrepreneur: <span class="cmitalic">I have a multi-shareholder company in which I’m the employee shareholder and I have an outside investor. The investor isn’t being paid, of course, since he’s only an investor. But how do I get the investor to understand that I need to be paid fairly for what I do?</span></p>
<p class="blockquote"><a id="page_15"/>Greg: <span class="cmitalic">One of the best examples is when you have what I call a money partner (the owner who provides investment capital to the business) and an effort partner (the owner who works in the business but does not have money to invest in the business). If I’m starting a business with you and I have the ability to do something but I have no cash, I need a funder to put money in. This philosophy says that 100 percent of the profits and losses of the business should be allocated to the money partner until that partner recoups the initial investment. After that, you move to some agreed profit-and-loss percentage.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say I’m worth $100,000, but I’m going to take only a $30,000 salary. This way, I pay back my money partners $70,000 a year sooner than if I had taken my full salary. This is a phenomenally effective way for you to create capital in the business. The key, though, is to never let yourself be trapped into thinking that you’re worth only $30,000 a year. Make sure that you will be able to move your salary to a market-based wage at some point. You must discuss the wage issue with the money partner up front. Decide what the market-based wage is from the very start so you’re in agreement when the time comes to increase your salary.</p>
<p class="indent">If you can’t go without a market-based wage, it means that your standard of living requires you to be paid your full salary from the beginning. In this case, you’re going to slow the process of the investor getting back the return on his or her investment. I’m not a fan of sharing profits before the investors are paid back. There’s always going to be some animosity. The investor will think: <span class="cmitalic">Hey, I put all the money in, and you’re getting your salary and a share of the profits. Look at how long it will take for me to get my money back.</span></p>
<p class="indent">One of the skill sets that we’ve built into our firm is the ability to forecast and quantify every situation. We believe that you have to play out multiple scenarios—actually plan out those cash flows—and create reasonable expectations for the investor. Will it take eighteen months for the investors to get their money back? Or will it take five years? And <a id="page_16"/>is there a scenario in which an investor never gets the money? If that last question is a possibility, the deal shouldn’t have been done! Quantify everything, and put it in writing.</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">TRANSITIONING OUT OF YOUR BUSINESS</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s another way in which giving yourself a market-based wage helps you. Let’s say you’re the founder of a business, a single shareholder, and you’re ready to sell the business or transition out of it. If you’re not paying yourself a market-based wage, you really don’t know what it means from a financial standpoint to bring in another general manager. You’ll have to pay your replacement a market-based wage, and this will negatively impact your business’s net income. But if you’re already paying yourself a market-based wage, it’s easier to step out of the role of being an active manager and into the role of being only a shareholder. You can hire your replacement with no negative impact on your net income. Not only that, you have a methodology in place that reflects the true profitability of your business.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of retiring, you might consider a part-time role that pays less than your CEO salary, such as being a finance person or a customer advocate. I recommend easing out slowly, because stepping out of a business abruptly usually creates a vacuum. This approach allows you to effectively transition out of the business in phases. You’ll also know if your business will produce, for example, $500,000 a year of pretax profit no matter who’s running it. And if you give your replacement a market-based wage while you stay on in a lesser role, then you can hold that new person accountable.</p>
<p class="indent">You can even set up an incentive program to motivate the new CEO. Tell the new person, “I’ll share a percentage of anything you get above my baseline profit number. Your baseline could be what the business was doing before you hired on as the new CEO or it could even be a higher target. But if you don’t get what I was getting when I was CEO, you’d better give me a good reason. Is the market causing lower revenue and profitability, or is it because you can’t make it happen?”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"/>This naturally leads to a question:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Entrepreneur: <span class="cmitalic">So how do I know what my business’s baseline number should be?</span></p>
<p class="blockquote">Greg: <span class="cmitalic">There are some business performance basics that help you decide your target profitability level. And then you’ve got to adjust salaries and all the other operating expenses to make sure that you hit those profitability levels.</span></p>
<p class="indent">In the next few chapters, we’ll touch on these business performance basics, and I’ll show you how to build your business up from your baseline number. It’s not as complex as everybody likes to make it seem.</p>
<h3><span class="cmbold">TWO CHALLENGES</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Are you underpaying yourself and bragging about your sales or your net income? To make sure you are not just showing off your peacock feathers when you talk about your financials, you need to face two challenges.</p>
<h4>Challenge #1: Be a More Demanding Employee</h4>
<p class="noindent">Are you making $30,000 a year when you’re really worth $100,000, or maybe even $150,000 or $200,000 a year? If so, why are you willing to work for such a low salary? To answer this question, you need a long-term goal that makes working for such a low salary worth your while, and you need a plan to pay yourself a market-based salary after that goal is met—a real cash salary, not a distribution of profits.</p>
<h4>Challenge #2: Be a Demanding Shareholder</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you are accepting a below-market wage, you are overstating the profits of your business. As a demanding shareholder, you would never stand for that.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"/>If you’re a single-shareholder business and you can’t be demanding enough on your own, you may need to have a one-on-one relationship with a key advisor. If your advisor is not really helping, it’s okay to end the relationship. Find a different advisor who will talk straight and help you drive your business forward.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve had clients who have used advisory boards, which were usually found largely ineffective. If you chose to have an advisory board, make sure you aren’t listening to too many voices, and make sure the voices you are listening to have something relevant to say.</p>
<p class="indent">Keep your goal in mind: You don’t want your numbers to lie to you. Inaccurate numbers will distort your financial information and cause other problems as well.</p>
<p class="h3k"><span class="cmbold-italic">Chapter 1 Keys</span></p>
<ol class="olist">
<li class="nl">Know what your market-based wage is for your role. If the business cannot afford to pay you, keep track of the wages you are giving up.</li>
<li class="nl">If you are profitable and you pay yourself wages that are too low, you run a high risk of an IRS audit. And no one wants an IRS audit.</li>
