In fact, isn’t it about time we move on to CSS and learn how to make all this bland markup look fabulous? Before we do, we need to make sure your HTML is really ready for the big leagues. Don’t get us wrong, you’ve been writing first-class HTML all along, but there are just a few extra things you need to do to make it “industry standard” HTML. It’s also time you think about making sure you’re using the latest and greatest HTML standard, otherwise known as HTML5. By doing so, you’ll ensure they’ll display more uniformly across all browsers (at least the ones you’d care about), not to mention, they’ll play well with the latest i-Devices (pick your favorite). You’ll also have pages that load faster, pages that are guaranteed to play well with CSS, and pages that are ready to move into the future as the standards grow. Get ready, this is the chapter where you move from web tinkerer to web professional.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00352a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00352"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244973.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="294" height="499"/></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim:</strong></span> Ready for prime time?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank:</strong></span> Yeah, you know, make sure it’s totally legit and ready for HTML5.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim:</strong></span> Our HTML is just fine...here, look at it in the browser. It looks beautiful.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Joe:</strong></span> Yeah, that’s what I think...he’s just trying to give us another thing to do.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank:</strong></span> Actually guys, I hate to admit it, but I think the boss is right on this one.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim, Joe:</strong></span> Huh?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank:</strong></span> Up until now we’ve pretty much ignored the fact that there are standards for this stuff. Not to mention there are different versions of HTML, like HTML 4.01, and now, HTML5. Are we doing everything we need to make sure we’ve got HTML5 covered?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Joe:</strong></span> Come on, this is just going to mean even more work. We’ve already got enough to do. Really, the page looks fine; I’ve even tested it on some of the newer devices.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank:</strong></span> That may be, but what I’m saying is that I think this will help us do less work in the future.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Joe:</strong></span> Oh yeah? How so?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank:</strong></span> Well, if we make sure our HTML is up-to-date with current standards, we won’t have to make as many changes down the road. We should also make sure everything else is correct; you know, our syntax and all that. There are so many different browsers and versions of those browsers that if we’re making mistakes in our HTML, then all bets are off in terms of how our pages will look in different browsers. And when we start adding presentation to HTML with CSS, the differences will get even more dramatic if our HTML isn’t up to snuff.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Joe:</strong></span> So, by making sure we’re adhering to the “standard,” we’ll have a lot fewer problems with our pages displaying incorrectly for our customers?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank:</strong></span> Right.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim:</strong></span> If it reduces the number of 3 a.m. calls I get, then that sounds like a good idea to me.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Joe:</strong></span> All right, how do we start? Don’t we adhere to the standards now? What’s wrong with our HTML?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank:</strong></span> Maybe nothing, but the boss wants to be current with HTML5, so we need to figure out which version of HTML we’re using and if it’s not HTML5, what we need to do to get there. And, when we’re done, life should be much easier when we start using CSS.</p><div class="note" title="Brain Power"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06note01"></a>Brain Power</h3><p>Browsers all do a pretty good job of consistently displaying your pages when you write correct HTML, but when you make mistakes or do nonstandard things in your HTML, pages are often displayed differently from one browser to another.

As you know, “HTML versions” have become a popular issue. What’s the deal with that? You’re a web browser, after all. I give you HTML and you display it the best you can.</p><p title="Browser:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Browser:</strong></span></strong></span> Being a browser is tough...there are a lot of web pages out there, and many are written with old versions of HTML or with mistakes in their markup. Like you said, my job is to try to display every single one of those pages, no matter what.</p><p title="Head First:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Head First:</strong></span></strong></span> So what’s the big deal? You seem to be doing a pretty good job of it.</p><p title="Browser:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Browser:</strong></span></strong></span> In some cases, sure, but have you ever looked at your pages on a lot of different browsers? When you are using old or incorrect markup, your page may look great on one browser, but not so great on another.</p><p title="Head First:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Head First:</strong></span></strong></span> Really? Why is that? Don’t you all do the same thing?</p><p title="Browser:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Browser:</strong></span></strong></span> We do a great job of doing the same thing, <span class="emphasis"><em>when we’re displaying correct and up-to-date page</em></span> s. Like I said, when you venture into pages that aren’t written well, then things get a lot dicier. Here’s why: all of us browsers have the HTML specification to tell us how to display correct HTML, but when it comes to incorrect HTML, we just wing it. So, you might get very different behaviors on different browsers.</p><p title="Head First:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Head First:</strong></span></strong></span> Ahh. So, what’s the solution to this mess? We definitely want our pages to look good.</p><p title="Browser:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Browser:</strong></span></strong></span> Easy. Tell me up front which version of HTML you’re using. You’d be surprised how many pages don’t even do that. And make sure your page doesn’t contain any errors; you know, mismatched markup tags, that kind of thing.</p><p title="Head First:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Head First:</strong></span></strong></span> How do we tell you which version we’re using? Especially now that we’re all moving on to HTML5.</p><p title="Browser:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Browser:</strong></span></strong></span> Well, HTML5 is actually making things a little simpler.</p><p title="Head First:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Head First:</strong></span></strong></span> Really? How is a new version of HTML helping? I would have thought yet another version would just make things even more difficult.</p><p title="Browser:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Browser:</strong></span></strong></span> It’s true that any new version of a language causes growing pains as everyone tries to catch up with the latest standard. But HTML5 simplifies the way you tell me the kind of HTML you’re using. The HTML5 standard is also documenting many of the errors that can occur in web pages, so that all the browsers can be more consistent about how they handle those errors.</p><p title="Head First:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Head First:</strong></span></strong></span> Oh, so does that mean we don’t have to worry about making errors when we’re writing our HTML?</p><p title="Browser:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Browser:</strong></span></strong></span> No! Just because we can handle errors better doesn’t mean you can be sloppy. You still want your page to be consistent with the standard and written without errors. If you don’t, you might get inconsistent results across browsers, and let’s not forget the browsers on mobile devices, too.</p><p title="Head First:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Head First:</strong></span></strong></span> Back to how we tell you what version we’re using?</p><p title="Browser:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Browser:</strong></span></strong></span> Yeah, that used to be a total pain in the...</p><p title="Head First:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Head First:</strong></span></strong></span> Uh, watch it, this is a PG-rated audience, and we’re running out of time, quickly!</p><p title="Browser:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Browser:</strong></span></strong></span> Okay, you can tell me all about the version of HTML you’re using with a <span class="strong"><strong>doctype</strong></span>.

No, it’s not a typo, and let’s step through why: you know the doctype used to be a complicated mess full of version numbers and ugly syntax. But with the arrival of HTML5, the doctype was simplified so that now all we have to do is tell the browser we’re using “html”; no more worrying about specific version numbers or languages or pointing to a standard.</p><p>How can that be? How can we just specify “html” without the rest? Doesn’t the browser <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> that other information? Well, as it turns out, when the browser sees:</p><a id="pro_id00027"></a><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</strong></span></pre><p>it assumes you’re using standard HTML. No more getting all hung up on version numbers or where the standard is located; in fact, the HTML standard has become a “living standard,” meaning that it will continue to grow and morph as needed, but without fixed version numbers. Now, you’re probably thinking, “What exactly does a <span class="emphasis"><em>living standard</em></span> mean? How is that going to work?” You’ll see, on the next page...</p></div><div class="sect1" title="HTML, the new “living standard”"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="htmlcomma_the_new_quotation_markliving_s"></a>HTML, the new “living standard”</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1393" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1855" class="indexterm"></a>You heard us right...rather than continue to crank out version 6, 7, 8 of HTML, the standards guys (and gals) have turned the specification into a living standard that will document the technology as it evolves. So, no more version numbers. And you can stop calling it HTML5 because it’s just “HTML” from here on out.</p><p>Now, you’re probably wondering how this is going to work in practice. After all, if the spec is continually changing, what does that mean for the poor browsers? Not to mention, for you, the web developer? One key to this working is <span class="emphasis"><em>backwards compatibility</em></span>. Backwards compatibility means that we can keep adding new stuff to HTML, and the browsers will (eventually) support this new stuff, but they’ll also keep supporting the old stuff. So the HTML pages you’re writing today will keep working, even after new features have been added later.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00364a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00364"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244997.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="720" height="330"/></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="there_are_no_dumb_questions-id00079"></a><p class="title">There are no Dumb Questions</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="qandaset" title="Frequently Asked Questions"><table border="0" width="100%" summary="Q and A Set"><col align="left" width="1%"/><col/><tbody><tr class="question" title="Q:"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="ch06qa1qe1"></a><a id="ch06qa1q1"></a><p>Q:</p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Q: So what happens if the spec changes tomorrow?

If there’s an “a” in the file, then the browser should display an “a”. Right?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank:</strong></span> Well, what if you’re using Chinese in your pages? It’s an entirely different “alphabet” and it has a heck of a lot more than 26 A–Z characters.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim:</strong></span> Oh. Good point...but shouldn’t the browser be able to tell the difference?

With Unicode, we can represent all languages with one type of encoding. But, given there are other encodings out there, we still need to tell the browser we’re using Unicode (or another encoding of your choice).

First, if your image is broken for some reason (say, your image server goes down, or your connection is really slow), the alt attribute will (in most browsers) show the alt text you’ve specified in place of the image. Second, for vision-impaired users who are using a screen reader to read the page, the screen reader will read the alt text to the user, which helps them understand the page better.</p></td></tr><tr class="question" title="Q:"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="ch06qa3qe4"></a><a id="ch06qa3q4"></a><p>Q:</p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Q: What if I tell the browser I’m using HTML5, and I’m not?</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="ch06qa3q4a4"></a><p>A:</p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p><span class="strong"><strong>A:</strong></span> The browser will figure out that you’re not really writing HTML5 and use the error handling capabilities it has to try to do the right thing.

First, there are some new elements and attributes in HTML5 that are pretty cool (like the &lt;video&gt; element), and others that will help you write better pages (we’ll be getting to those later in the book).</p><p>Second, there are many new features that allow web developers to create web <span class="emphasis"><em>applications</em></span> with HTML5. Web applications are web pages that behave more like applications (like the ones you’re used to using on your laptop or mobile device) than static web pages. If you’re interested in creating web applications, then after you’re all done with this book (cue shameless plug), you should check out <span class="emphasis"><em>Head First HTML5 Programming</em></span> (O’Reilly).</p><p>Finally, the HTML5 specification is a lot more robust than the specifications for the previous versions of HTML. Remember how we said that the specification is now documenting common errors that web developers make? And helping browsers to know how to handle those errors? That means that web pages with errors on them don’t cause the havoc they used to, which is a good thing for users.</p><p>All in all, HTML5 is a big improvement over HTML 4.01, and well worth learning.

    <span class="strong"><strong>&lt;/p&gt;</strong></span>
    <span class="strong"><strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong></span>
        <span class="strong"><strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong></span>Always dress in layers and keep an html around your
            head and body<span class="strong"><strong>.&lt;/li&gt;</strong></span>

The validator assumes we’re writing HTML 4.01 Transitional (which was a version of HTML 4.01 designed to use while you were “transitioning” to XHTML). The validator really doesn’t like that there’s no doctype, and complains a couple of times about that. It also complains about the &lt;meta charset=“utf-8”&gt;, because before HTML5, charset was not a valid attribute of the &lt;meta&gt; tag. You can get the idea that using a doctype makes both the validator, and the browsers, happier campers.</p></blockquote></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06note11"></a>Note</h3><p>Your notes here.
