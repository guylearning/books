First, you have to <span class="emphasis"><em>get</em></span> it, then make sure you don’t <span class="emphasis"><em>forget</em></span> it. It’s not about pushing facts into your head. Based on the latest research in cognitive science, neurobiology, and educational psychology, <span class="emphasis"><em>learning</em></span> takes a lot more than text on a page. We know what turns your brain on.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Some of the Head First learning principles:</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Make it visual.</strong></span> Images are far more memorable than words alone, and make learning much more effective (up to 89% improvement in recall and transfer studies). It also makes things more understandable. <span class="strong"><strong>Put the words within or near the graphics</strong></span> they relate to, rather than on the bottom or on another page, and learners will be up to <span class="emphasis"><em>twice</em></span> as likely to solve problems related to the content.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00008a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00008"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244261.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="226" height="145"/></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Use a conversational and personalized style.</strong></span> In recent studies, students performed up to 40% better on post-learning tests if the content spoke directly to the reader, using a first-person, conversational style rather than taking a formal tone. Tell stories instead of lecturing. Use casual language. Don’t take yourself too seriously. Which would <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> pay more attention to: a stimulating dinner-party companion, or a lecture?</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00009a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00009"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244263.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="178" height="306"/></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Get the learner to think more deeply.</strong></span> In other words, unless you actively flex your neurons, nothing much happens in your head. A reader has to be motivated, engaged, curious, and inspired to solve problems, draw conclusions, and generate new knowledge. And for that, you need challenges, exercises, and thought-provoking questions, and activities that involve both sides of the brain, and multiple senses.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00010a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00010"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244265.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="198" height="254"/></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Get—and keep—the reader’s attention.</strong></span> We’ve all had the “I really want to learn this, but I can’t stay awake past page one” experience. Your brain pays attention to things that are out of the ordinary, interesting, strange, eye-catching, unexpected. Learning a new, tough, technical topic doesn’t have to be boring. Your brain will learn much more quickly if it’s not.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Touch their emotions.</strong></span> We now know that your ability to remember something is largely dependent on its emotional content. You remember what you <span class="emphasis"><em>care</em></span> about. You remember when you <span class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> something. No, we’re not talking heart-wrenching stories about a boy and his dog. We’re talking emotions like surprise, curiosity, fun, “what the...?”, and the feeling of “I rule!” that comes when you solve a puzzle, learn something everybody else thinks is hard, or realize you know something that “I’m more technical than thou” Bob from engineering <span class="emphasis"><em>doesn’t</em></span>.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00011a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00011"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244267.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="64" height="79"/></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Metacognition: thinking about thinking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="metacognition_thinking_about_thinking"></a>Metacognition: thinking about thinking</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1521" class="indexterm"></a>If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more deeply, pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. Learn how you learn.</p><p>Most of us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we were growing up. We were <span class="emphasis"><em>expected</em></span> to learn, but rarely <span class="emphasis"><em>taught</em></span> how to learn.</p><p>But we assume that if you’re holding this book, you really want to learn how to create web pages. And you probably don’t want to spend a lot of time. And you want to <span class="emphasis"><em>remember</em></span> what you read, and be able to apply it. And for that, you’ve got to <span class="emphasis"><em>understand</em></span> it. To get the most from this book, or <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> book or learning experience, take responsibility for your brain. Your brain on <span class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> content.</p><p>The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being. As important as a tiger. Otherwise, you’re in for a constant battle, with your brain doing its best to keep the new content from sticking.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00012a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00012"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244269.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="261" height="375"/></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>So how <span class="emphasis"><em>DO</em></span> you get your brain to think HTML &amp; CSS are as important as a tiger?</strong></span></p><p>There’s the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> able to learn and remember even the dullest of topics, if you keep pounding on the same thing. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t <span class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> important to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing <span class="emphasis"><em>over</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>over</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>over</em></span>, so I suppose it must be.”</p><p>The faster way is to do <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>anything that increases brain activity,</strong></span></em></span> especially different <span class="emphasis"><em>types</em></span> of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution, and they’re all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For example, studies show that putting words <span class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span> the pictures they describe (as opposed to somewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to make sense of how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to <span class="emphasis"><em>get</em></span> that this is something worth paying attention to, and possibly recording.</p><p>A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow along and hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily <span class="emphasis"><em>care</em></span> that the “conversation” is between you and a book! On the other hand, if the writing style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees. No need to stay awake.</p><p>But pictures and conversational style are just the beginning.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Here’s what WE did"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="hereapostrophes_what_we_did"></a>Here’s what WE did</h1></div></div></div><p>We used <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>pictures</strong></span></em></span>, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain’s concerned, a picture really <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> worth 1,024 words. And when text and pictures work together, we embedded the text <span class="emphasis"><em>in</em></span> the pictures because your brain works more effectively when the text is <span class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span> the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the text somewhere.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00013a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00013"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244271.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="369" height="172"/></div></div><p>We used <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>redundancy</strong></span></em></span>, saying the same thing in <span class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> ways and with different media types, and <span class="emphasis"><em>multiple senses</em></span>, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area of your brain.</p><p>We used concepts and pictures in <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>unexpected</strong></span></em></span> ways because your brain is tuned for novelty, and we used pictures and ideas with at least <span class="emphasis"><em>some <span class="strong"><strong>emotional</strong></span> content</em></span>, because your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions. That which causes you to <span class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> something is more likely to be remembered, even if that feeling is nothing more than a little <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>humor</strong></span></em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>surprise</strong></span></em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>interest.</strong></span></em></span></p><p>We used a personalized, <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>conversational style</strong></span></em></span>, because your brain is tuned to pay more attention when it believes you’re in a conversation than if it thinks you’re passively listening to a presentation.

We deliberately stripped out everything that might get in the way of learning whatever it is we’re working on at that point in the book. And the first time through, you need to begin at the beginning, because the book makes assumptions about what you’ve already seen and learned.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>We begin by teaching basic HTML, then standards-based HTML5.</strong></span></p><p>To write standards-based HTML, there are a lot of technical details you need to understand that aren’t helpful when you’re trying to learn the basics of HTML. Our approach is to have you learn the basic concepts of HTML first (without worrying about these details), and then, when you have a solid understanding of HTML, teach you to write standards-compliant HTML (the most recent version of which is HTML5). This has the added benefit that the technical details are more meaningful after you’ve already learned the basics.</p><p>It’s also important that you be writing compliant HTML when you start using CSS, so we make a point of getting you to standards-based HTML before you begin any serious work with CSS.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>We don’t cover every single HTML element or attribute or CSS property ever created.</strong></span></p><p>There are a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of HTML elements, <span class="emphasis"><em>a lot</em></span> of attributes, and <span class="emphasis"><em>a lot</em></span> of CSS properties. Sure, they’re all interesting, but our goal was to write a book that weighs less than the person reading it, so we don’t cover them all here. Our focus is on the core HTML elements and CSS properties that <span class="emphasis"><em>matter</em></span> to you, the beginner, and making sure that you really, truly, deeply understand how and when to use them. In any case, once you’re done with <span class="emphasis"><em>Head First HTML and CSS</em></span>, you’ll be able to pick up any reference book and get up to speed quickly on all the elements and properties we left out.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>This book advocates a clean separation between the structure of your pages and the presentation of your pages.</strong></span></p><p>Today, serious web pages use HTML to structure their content, and CSS for style and presentation. Nineties-era pages often used a different model, one where HTML was used for both structure and style. This book teaches you to use HTML for structure and CSS for style; we see no reason to teach you outdated bad habits.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>We encourage you to use more than one browser with this book.</strong></span></p><p>While we teach you to write HTML and CSS that are based on standards, you’ll still (and probably always) encounter minor differences in the way web browsers display pages. So, we encourage you to pick at least two modern browsers and test your pages using them. This will give you experience in seeing the differences among browsers and in creating pages that work well in a variety of them.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>We often use tag names for element names.</strong></span></p><p>Rather than saying “the a element,” or “the ‘a’ element,” we use a tag name, like “the <code class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</code> element.” While this may not be technically correct (because <code class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</code> is an opening tag, not a full-blown element), it does make the text more readable, and we usually follow the name with the word “element” to avoid confusion.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The activities are NOT optional.</strong></span></p><p>The exercises and activities are not add-ons; they’re part of the core content of the book. Some of them are to help with memory, some are for understanding, and some will help you apply what you’ve learned. <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Don’t skip the exercises.</strong></span></em></span> The crossword puzzles are the only things you don’t <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> to do, but they’re good for giving your brain a chance to think about the words in a different context.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The redundancy is intentional and important.</strong></span></p><p>One distinct difference in a Head First book is that we want you to <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> get it. And we want you to finish the book remembering what you’ve learned. Most reference books don’t have retention and recall as a goal, but this book is about <span class="emphasis"><em>learning</em></span>, so you’ll see some of the same concepts come up more than once.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The examples are as lean as possible.</strong></span></p><p>Our readers tell us that it’s frustrating to wade through 200 lines of an example looking for the two lines they need to understand. Most examples in this book are shown within the smallest possible context, so that the part you’re trying to learn is clear and simple. Don’t expect all of the examples to be robust, or even complete—they are written specifically for learning, and aren’t always fully functional.</p><p>We’ve placed all the example files on the Web so you can download them. You’ll find them at <span class="strong"><strong><a class="ulink" href="http://wickedlysmart.com/hfhtmlcss/">http://wickedlysmart.com/hfhtmlcss/</a></strong></span>.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The Brain Power exercises don’t have answers.</strong></span></p><p>For some of them, there is no right answer, and for others, part of the learning experience of the Brain Power activities is for you to decide if and when your answers are right. In some of the Brain Power exercises, you will find hints to point you in the right direction.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Tech reviewers (first edition)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="tech_reviewers_left_parenthesisfirst_edi"></a>Tech reviewers (first edition)</h1></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00019a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00019"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244283.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="133" height="175"/><div class="caption"><p>Louise Barr</p></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00020a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00020"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244285.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="141" height="175"/><div class="caption"><p>Joe Konior</p></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00021a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00021"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244287.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="137" height="179"/><div class="caption"><p>Valentin Crettaz</p></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00022a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00022"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244289.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="168" height="197"/><div class="caption"><p>Corey McGlone</p></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00023a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00023"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244291.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="169" height="186"/><div class="caption"><p>Barney Marispini</p></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00024a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00024"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244293.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="319" height="284"/></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00025a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00025"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244295.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="281" height="297"/></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00026a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00026"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244297.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="170" height="180"/><div class="caption"><p>Marcus Green</p></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00027a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00027"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244299.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="162" height="194"/><div class="caption"><p>Ike Van Atta</p></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00028a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00028"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244301.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="156" height="181"/><div class="caption"><p>David O’Meara</p></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Our reviewers:</strong></span></em></span></p><p>We’re extremely grateful for our technical review team. <span class="strong"><strong>Johannes de Jong</strong></span> organized and led the whole effort, acted as “series dad,” and made it all work smoothly. <span class="strong"><strong>Pauline McNamara</strong></span>, “co-manager” of the effort, held things together and was the first to point out when our examples were a little more “baby boomer” than hip.
