Eric is now devoting his time to WickedlySmart, a startup he co-created with Elisabeth.</p><p>By training, Eric is a computer scientist, having studied with industry luminary David Gelernter during his Ph.D. work at Yale University. His dissertation is credited as the seminal work in alternatives to the desktop metaphor, and also as the first implementation of activity streams, a concept he and Dr. Gelernter developed.</p><p>In his spare time, Eric is deeply involved with music; you’ll find Eric’s latest project, a collaboration with ambient music pioneer Steve Roach, available on the iPhone App Store under the name Immersion Station.</p><p>Eric lives with his wife and young daughter on Bainbridge Island. His daughter is a frequent
            visitor to Eric’s studio, where she loves to turn the knobs of his synths and
            audio effects.</p><p>Write to Eric at <span class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:eric@wickedlysmart.com">eric@wickedlysmart.com</a></span> or visit his site at <a class="ulink" href="http://ericfreeman.com">http://ericfreeman.com</a>.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00003a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00003"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2244251.png.jpg" alt="image with no caption" width="260" height="286"/></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Elisabeth</strong></span> is a software engineer, writer, and trainer. She has been passionate about technology since her days as a student at Yale University, where she earned a master’s of science in computer science and designed a concurrent, visual programming language and software architecture.</p><p>Elisabeth’s been involved with the Internet since the early days; she co-created the award-winning website, the Ada Project, one of the first websites designed to help women in computer science find career and mentorship information online.</p><p>She’s currently co-founder of WickedlySmart, an online education experience centered on web technologies, where she creates books, articles, videos and more.
