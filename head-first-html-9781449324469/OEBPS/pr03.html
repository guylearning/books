It correctly anticipates readers’ puzzlements and handles them just in time. The highly graphic and incremental approach precisely mimics the best way to learn this stuff: make a small change and see it in the browser to understand what each new item means.”</p><div class="attribution"><p>—<span class="attribution"><span class="strong"><strong>Danny Goodman, author of <span class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Guide</em></span></strong></span></span></p></div></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson clearly know their stuff. As the Internet becomes more complex, inspired construction of web pages becomes increasingly critical. Elegant design is at the core of every chapter here, each concept conveyed with equal doses of pragmatism and wit.”</p><div class="attribution"><p>—<span class="attribution"><span class="strong"><strong>Ken Goldstein, Executive Vice President and Managing Director, Disney Online</strong></span></span></p></div></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“The Web would be a much better place if every HTML author started off by reading this book.”</p><div class="attribution"><p>—<span class="attribution"><span class="strong"><strong>L.

HTML used to be something you could just hack away at until things looked okay on screen, but with the advent of web standards and the movement toward accessibility, sloppy coding practice is not acceptable anymore...from a business standpoint or a social responsibility standpoint. <span class="emphasis"><em>Head First HTML and CSS</em></span> teaches you how to do things right from the beginning without making the whole process seem overwhelming. HTML, when properly explained, is no more complicated than plain English, and the authors do an excellent job of keeping every concept at eye level.”</p><div class="attribution"><p>—<span class="attribution"><span class="strong"><strong>Mike Davidson, President and CEO, Newsvine, Inc.</strong></span></span></p></div></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“The information covered in this book is the same material the pros know, but taught in an educational and humorous manner that doesn’t ever make you think the material is impossible to learn or you are out of your element.”</p><div class="attribution"><p>—<span class="attribution"><span class="strong"><strong>Christopher Schmitt, author of <span class="emphasis"><em>The CSS Cookbook</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Professional CSS</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="email"><a class="email" href="mailto:schmitt@christopher.org">schmitt@christopher.org</a></span></em></span></strong></span></span></p></div></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“Oh, great. You made an HTML book simple enough a CEO can understand it. What will you do next? Accounting simple enough my developer can understand it?
