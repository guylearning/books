			<p class="x02-PO-Body-Text"><span class="_2-PO-Text-1st-Line-Run-In">PART OF TAKING </span>command of your life is controlling the things you can. Another part is managing the things you can’t—your vulnerabilities or weaknesses.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">Think again of the computer analogy we discussed earlier. You have the power to change your programming, at least to some extent. In some cases, you can rewrite your existing algorithms, reprogramming how you respond to, say, emotion or social pressure or threats to your ego. Rewriting those algorithms is a great way to build strength.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92" role="doc-pagebreak" title="92"/>But sometimes there are harmful algorithms you can’t rewrite. You can’t change your biological instincts, the inborn tendencies that resist any attempt to change them. Just because you can’t change them, however, doesn’t mean you can’t manage them. Doing so is merely a matter of programming new subroutines into your life that help mitigate or contain the harmful effects. Adding those subroutines is a way of managing weakness.</p>
