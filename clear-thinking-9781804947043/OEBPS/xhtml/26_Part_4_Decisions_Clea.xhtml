			<p class="x02-PO-Body-Text"><span class="_2-PO-Text-1st-Line-Run-In">ONCE YOU HAVE </span>reprogrammed your defaults to create space for clear thinking, you must master the skill of decision-making.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">Decisions are different from choices. If you casually select an option from a range of alternatives, you’ve made a choice. If you react without thinking, you’ve made an unconscious choice. But neither of these is the same as a decision. A decision is a choice that involves conscious thought.</p>
			<p class="x14-Free-Style-7">The decision = the judgment that a certain option is the best one</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text-FL"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_120" role="doc-pagebreak" title="120"/>Often what seems like poor judgment in hindsight doesn’t even register as a decision in the moment. When the defaults conspire, we react without thinking. And that reaction doesn’t even count as a decision. Once we register the opportunity to make a conscious choice, the question becomes: How can we make the best decision possible?</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">The decision itself should represent the outcome of the decision-making process. That process is about weighing your options with the aim of selecting the best one, and it’s composed of four stages: defining the problem, exploring possible solutions, evaluating the options, and finally making the judgment and executing the best option. We will discuss each of these components in detail throughout this chapter.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_121" role="doc-pagebreak" title="121"/>If you don’t apply this process, your choice doesn’t necessarily count as a decision.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">Small children tend to make choices without any kind of evaluation. Sometimes adults do too. Perhaps it’s because we have to make a choice so quickly that we don’t have time to evaluate the options. Or maybe it’s because we let habit choose for us, the inertia of past choices carrying us through the present moment without exploring our options. Or maybe it’s just that we let our emotions make choices without even realizing it—momentary anger, fear, or desire preempting evaluation and pushing us to act without thinking or reason.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">None of these examples count as decisions. That doesn’t mean we’re not responsible for them. We are! It simply means we’re not reasoning. We’re not consciously thinking. Instead, we’re reacting, and giving up our deciding moment to our defaults. It’s in these moments that we often do something contrary to what we’d decide is best if we reasoned instead of reacted. When we react without reason, we cause more problems than we solve. If only we had the hindsight of our future selves as our foresight now!</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">Not every bad decision is rushed, nor is every good one made slowly. It’s not that simple.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">People mistake choosing for decisiveness and the decision-making process for waffling. Part of what makes slowing down and reasoning through a problem difficult is that, to the outside observer, it might look like inaction. But inaction is a choice.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">When the stakes are low, inaction hurts you more than speed. Sometimes it’s better just to make a quick <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122" role="doc-pagebreak" title="122"/>choice and not spend time deliberating. Why waste time evaluating if an action is inconsequential and its effects are easily reversed? For example, if there are two identical squat racks in the gym and both are momentarily open, it makes no difference which one you take. If you wait and decide, they’ll both be taken by someone else. Just choose either one.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">When the stakes are higher, though, speed can hurt you. If an action could have a major impact on your life or your business and its effects can’t be reversed, you must decide and not merely choose. In these cases, the magnitude of the potential losses makes careful decision-making a worthwhile investment of your time. In these cases, evaluate the options and decide. Don’t just choose.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">The next few sections describe some tools for reasoning better when making decisions. They won’t solve every decision-making problem, because no tool is right for every job; each has its uses and limitations. You need multiple tools in your toolbox. Otherwise, you end up solving the wrong problems. As the old adage says, “If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.”</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">Knowing how to use these tools depends on keeping your defaults in check so you <i class="TG-ITAL">can</i> reason. If you can’t, you’ll just react with one of your defaults. While you might get the outcomes you desire for a while, it’s only a matter of time before lack of thinking catches up to you. It’s only after you’ve mastered the defaults that the tools I describe become useful.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">If you can’t keep those in check—if you’re easily <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_123" role="doc-pagebreak" title="123"/>swayed by emotion, if you can’t adapt to change, if you value being right more than doing what’s best—then all the tools in the world aren’t going to help you. The defaults will overwhelm you, rout your decision-making process, and seize control of your life.</p>
