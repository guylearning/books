			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Title" id="_idParaDest-55">Margin of Safety</h2>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">You don’t always need to have the ultimate solution to make progress. If it remains unclear which path is best, often the next best step is just to eliminate paths that lead to outcomes you don’t want. Avoiding the worst outcomes maintains optionality and keeps you moving forward.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sometimes things fail for reasons beyond our control. A lot of tricky and highly consequential decisions, though, fail for preventable reasons. When we don’t consider how things might go wrong and plan for them in advance, we’re left flat-footed when they do go wrong. Then we end up reacting instead of reasoning. It’s much easier to plan for things that could go wrong in advance when you’re calm and open-minded than it is to respond when things are in the midst of going wrong.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When failure is expensive, it’s worth investing in large margins of safety.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If you’re an investor, you’ve likely heard the story of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund founded in 1994 by a prominent investor who managed to get two Nobel <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_194" role="doc-pagebreak" title="194"/>laureates on his board. LTCM had a high risk portfolio that was highly acclaimed for its incredible returns—over 21 percent in its first year, then 43 percent in its second year, and 41 percent in its third year.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Imagine being an investor in this environment. You see this hedge fund taking off, and your friends are boasting of their success and urging you to join in on the bonanza. They tell you about the amazing people working there—people with incredibly high IQs, including two Nobel Prize winners, who are also experienced in their respective fields and who have invested substantial amounts of their own money.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">You watch your friends double and then quadruple their investments. You start wondering whether you should invest everything as well. Your own portfolio is returning 8 to 12 percent year over year—good returns, but not 40 percent! Is the rest of the world going to get rich while you play it safe?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Consider now two scenarios. In the first, you decide to follow your friends and invest everything you have in the fund. A few months later, Asia and Russia experience a financial crisis. That crisis together with LTCM’s highly leveraged investments loses them $4.6 billion in less than four months. The chart on the next page shows what that loss would look like if you had invested $1,000 from the beginning in 1994. In this scenario, you (and your friends) end up in financial ruin.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Imagine now a different scenario. It’s November 1997. You just hit the peak of returns at LTCM. If you anticipate that the future is going to be different from the past, you probably won’t assume astronomical losses, and might invest a little. But if you’re wise, you’ll maintain a margin of safety.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A margin of safety is a buffer between what you expect to happen and what could happen. It’s designed to save you when surprises are expensive.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_195" role="doc-pagebreak" title="195"/>A margin of safety is like having insurance. If you know in advance you won’t need to make a claim this year, it’s a waste of money to buy insurance. The problem is that you don’t know in what year you’ll need to make a claim, so you buy it every year. It might seem like a waste of money in years when nothing happens, but it shows its real value in years when something does.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Building a margin of safety means giving yourself as much cushioning and coverage in the future as possible. It’s a way of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_196" role="doc-pagebreak" title="196"/>preparing yourself for the widest range of possible future outcomes—and protecting yourself against the worst ones. In the second scenario, for instance, you can prepare yourself for the various bad outcomes that 1998 might bring by investing only one tenth of your portfolio in the fund. As a result, when the 1998 financial crisis comes, you’ll lose at most 10 percent of your investments. That won’t leave you happy, but it won’t leave you financially ruined either.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Your defaults are hard at work in the first scenario—not just the social default that convinces you that you’re better off following the crowd, but the ego default as well. It convinces you that you don’t need a margin of safety, because you know what’s going to happen. You feel confident predicting the future—predicting that the future is going to be like the past, that LTCM’s fourth year is going to be like its first three. The problem is that tomorrow is never exactly like today, and in that fourth year, the plan that garnered LTCM’s success in the previous three years stops working.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the second scenario, your decision isn’t based on a prediction; it’s instead prepared for a future in which your best-case scenario might not materialize. It’s that preparation mindset—as opposed to a prediction mindset—that saves you in the second scenario.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Warren Buffett has a saying that I often come back to: “Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing.”<a class="Endnote-Reference" href="40_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber46" id="SuperscriptNumber46" role="doc-noteref" title="note">[1]</a> The thing is, most of us rarely know what we are doing with the confidence required to go all in. When you don’t know what you are doing, a margin of safety saves you from the worst outcomes. Even when you do know what you’re doing and you make the best possible decision at the time, things can change.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If the worst-case outcomes never come to pass, the margin <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_197" role="doc-pagebreak" title="197"/>of safety will appear like a waste. The minute you convince yourself you could have done better without a margin of safety is exactly when you need it most.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We can’t prepare for everything. Some horrific events defy imagination, and no amount of preparation can ever give you enough optionality to deal with them. Yet we know from history that there are certain unfortunate events that we’re guaranteed to experience and that we can in fact prepare for, even if we have no idea when they’ll arrive. On a personal level, these include:</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">How do you build a margin of safety?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Let’s start with a very typical application. Engineers build margins of safety into everything they design. Suppose, for instance, that we’re designing a bridge and calculate that on an average day it will need to support 5,000 tons at any one time.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If we build it to withstand 5,001 tons, we have no margin of safety: What if there’s heavier traffic than usual one day? <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_198" role="doc-pagebreak" title="198"/>What if our calculations and estimates are a little off? What if the material weakens over time at a rate faster than we imagined? To account for all of these contingencies, we’d need to design the bridge to withstand 10,000 or even 20,000 tons. Why? Because we don’t know what the future will bring. We don’t know whether multiple trucks will ever get stuck on the bridge at the same time. We don’t know whether vehicles in the future will be much heavier than they are now. We don’t know many things about the future. So we design the bridge in a way that protects travelers in the widest range of possible future outcomes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Keep in mind as you’re preparing for the future that the worst outcomes in history have always surprised people at the time. You can’t use the historical worst case as your baseline. Engineers don’t rely just on the historical use of current bridges. You have to really stretch your imagination to explore and anticipate what could potentially go wrong.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s a simple heuristic for creating a margin of safety so you know when “enough is enough.”</p>
			<aside>
				<p class="x10-Sidebar-Box-Text-First"><span class="_0-Sidebar-Box-Run-in">tip:</span> The margin of safety is often sufficient when it can absorb double the worst-case scenario. So the baseline for a margin of safety is one that could withstand twice the amount of problems that would cause a crisis, or maintain twice the amount of resources needed to rebuild after a crisis.</p>
			</aside>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">For example, if you want to feel financially secure even if you lose your job, you can estimate how long it will take you to gain employment again, and then save enough to live off savings for double that amount of time.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">That’s our baseline. But we need to adapt our margin of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_199" role="doc-pagebreak" title="199"/>safety to the individual and situational circumstances. If the cost of failure is high, and outcomes are more consequential, you want a large margin of safety. For instance, if you’re worried about losing your job, and you’re in a sector or economy that’s volatile, you’ll want to increase the length of time you can take care of yourself while unemployed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If the cost of failure is low, and outcomes are less consequential, you can often reduce or skip the margin of safety. The longer something exists and performs well, the higher the probability that its pattern of success will continue. Coca-Cola isn’t going anywhere in the near future; neither is Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yet even established patterns aren’t foolproof. As Nassim Taleb writes in <i>The Black Swan</i>, “Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird’s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race ‘looking out for its best interests,’ as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.” Our outcomes can sometimes upend even our most well-established expectations.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">However, if you have a lot of expertise and data, you can reduce your margin of safety yet further. Here’s an example: Warren Buffett aims to buy stocks that are 30–50 percent less than their true value. So he has a 30–50 percent margin of safety on stocks. But he’ll pay close to a dollar on the dollar for stocks that he understands well. So there’s only maybe a 20 percent margin of safety on the stocks he’s the most confident in.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One of Warren Buffett’s core tenets for buying a business is that if he doesn’t understand it, he doesn’t buy it. In other words, if he doesn’t have enough information to calculate a margin of safety, he doesn’t invest at all. He also knows that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_200" role="doc-pagebreak" title="200"/>not all margins of safety will protect him—the goal isn’t to get it perfect for every stock he buys; it’s to use the best possible strategy for all his stocks in the big picture.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s the bottom line: Predicting the future is harder than it seems. Things are great until they’re not. If things are good, a margin of safety seems like a waste. When things go wrong, though, you can’t live without it. You need a margin of safety most at the very moment you start to think you don’t.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">Bullets before Cannonballs</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">If you’re still gathering information, don’t get overinvested in just one option. Keep your future options open by taking small, low-risk steps toward as many options as possible before committing everything to just one.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When you’re gathering information about your options, your best bet is to gather as much information as possible about each without investing too much time, money, or energy in any particular one. In <i>Great by Choice</i>, Morten Hansen and Jim Collins call this approach shooting bullets before cannonballs:<a class="Endnote-Reference" href="40_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber47" id="SuperscriptNumber47" role="doc-noteref" title="note">[2]</a></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p class="x06-Extract-FL">Picture yourself at sea, a hostile ship bearing down on you. You have a limited amount of gunpowder. You take all your gunpowder and use it to fire a big cannonball. The cannonball flies out over the ocean . . . and misses the target, off by 40 degrees. You turn to your stockpile and discover that you’re out of gunpowder. You die.</p>
				<p class="x06-Extract">But suppose instead that when you see the ship bearing down, you take a little bit of gunpowder and fire a bullet. It misses by 40 degrees. You make another bullet <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_201" role="doc-pagebreak" title="201"/>and fire. It misses by 30 degrees. You make a third bullet and fire, missing by only 10 degrees. The next bullet hits—ping!—the hull of the oncoming ship. Now, you take all the remaining gunpowder and fire a big cannonball along the same line of sight, which sinks the enemy ship. You live.<a class="Endnote-Reference" href="40_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber48" id="SuperscriptNumber48" role="doc-noteref" title="note">[3]</a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Here’s an example of bullets before cannonballs that I witnessed in real life. A client of mine—we’ll call him Solomon—was looking to hire someone to run his manufacturing business so he could step down and pursue other opportunities. He tried twice to choose a CEO to replace him. But each time, while the candidate looked great on paper, they didn’t work out in practice.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I recommended that instead of investing heavily in one candidate and turning down others, he should have two or three candidates perform a small test project lasting a couple weeks. These small simultaneous tests would maintain his optionality, and seeing the candidates perform in real life would be magnitudes more insightful than interviewing them or reading their résumés.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The two candidates were paid well for their time and tasked with a project that required them to work with the team to understand the problem, gather information, and chart a course forward.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The plan worked, and it yielded a surprising result: the candidate with the less impressive résumé was far and away the best with the team and made recommendations that ended up saving Solomon’s company more than they’d paid for the project. More importantly, if neither of the candidates had worked out, the company wasn’t saddled with an expensive exit cost.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_202" role="doc-pagebreak" title="202"/>Performing small, low-risk experiments on multiple options—in other words, shooting bullets and calibrating—keeps your options open before you commit the bulk of your resources to shooting a cannonball. Thinking about medical school? Shadow a doctor or a resident for a day. Take the MCAT and see what you score, or apply to colleges and see where you’re accepted. Thinking about a new career? Try doing it freelance a few nights per week first. Thinking about launching a new product? See if people are willing to pay for it before you build it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Preserving options carries a cost and can make you feel like you’re missing out. It’s hard watching others take action sometimes, even when those actions don’t make sense for you. Don’t be fooled! This is the social default at work. It tempts you to feel like it’s okay to fail so long as you’re part of the crowd.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">While some people are quick to join the crowd, others prefer to be correct. Preserving optionality can make you look stupid in the short term, which means that from time to time you’ll have to tolerate people treating you like you’re a fool. But if you look at the most successful people in the world, they’ve all looked short-term stupid on a number of occasions, when they were keeping their options open and waiting for the right time to act.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Warren Buffett sat out most of the dot-com craze of the late ’90s, and appeared to miss the stampeding bull market that came with it. People began chattering that he’d lost his touch. He may have looked stupid to some speculators for a few years—until the tech bubble burst and he still had tremendous cash reserves.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_203" role="doc-pagebreak" title="203"/>Live with a Decision before Announcing It</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Have you ever spent time crafting an email, and then instantly regretted it as soon as you hit “Send”? I have. It’s one of the worst feelings in the world. Perhaps not as bad, though, as announcing a major decision too soon and then realizing it was a mistake.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Many leaders want to announce a decision the moment they’ve made it. This is natural: they want to show others how decisive they are, and let everyone else revel in their dazzling new venture. But announcing right away can be like the email you can’t unsend. It starts things moving, and makes changing your mind much harder. That’s why I created a rule for myself: I make major decisions and then sleep on them before telling anyone.<a class="Footnote-Reference" epub:type="noteref" href="87_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" id="footnote-046-backlink" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*]</a></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">However, it turned out that sleeping on decisions by itself wasn’t enough. I added another element to the rule: before going to bed, I would write a note to myself explaining why I’d made the decision. Doing so allowed me to make the invisible visible. When I woke up in the morning, I’d read the note. More often than I’d like to admit, my best thinking from the day before fell short upon inspection in the harsh light of the morning. Sometimes I’d realize I really didn’t understand the problem as well as I thought I did. Other times, it just didn’t feel right anymore. And I’ve come to learn that this feeling is important to explore.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Living with a decision before announcing it allows you to look at it from a new perspective and verify your assumptions. Once you’ve made the decision—even if you haven’t <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_204" role="doc-pagebreak" title="204"/>communicated it—you start seeing things in a new light.<a class="Footnote-Reference" epub:type="noteref" href="88_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2" id="footnote-045-backlink" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*]</a> Your brain processes all the potential results of the decision as though it had already been made and put into action. This can often help you see nuances you might have missed, and those might, in turn, change how you implement the decision. Maybe you’re promoting someone, and you’re worried about their ability to lead a meeting and organize a team. Living with the decision might spur you to have them organize a meeting, see what happens, and recalibrate if necessary.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Also, living with a decision on your own for a day—or even two—allows you to check it with your emotions. Does this decision feel good in your bones? Do your brain and your heart and your guts all agree with it? Most decisions will feel fine. But a handful won’t. If one doesn’t feel right, it’s a sign that something is off, and you need to dig deeper before announcing your decision. Keeping it to yourself before executing allows you to keep open the possibility of undoing it.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">The Fail-Safe Principle</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Implementing fail-safes will help ensure that your decision is executed according to plan.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Imagine standing on Mount Everest, just fifty meters from reaching the very top. Your entire body is aching. Your mind is numb. It feels like no matter how hard you breathe there’s just not enough oxygen. You’ve been training for years, spent $60,000 on guides and travel, sacrificing time with your family and friends in the process. You’ve told everyone today is the day you’ll make the attempt. Everything you’ve worked for is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_205" role="doc-pagebreak" title="205"/>right in front of you. You can see your goal. You’re nearly there. But you’re thirty minutes behind schedule, and oxygen is running low. Do you turn around or push forward?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The world’s best Sherpas know that the most dangerous part of summiting Mount Everest isn’t reaching the peak; it’s the descent. So much energy is spent getting to the top that even if climbers are running out of strength or oxygen, they keep pushing themselves to the summit. They spend so much of their resources getting there, they neglect to account for the ordeal of getting back. Lost in “summit fever” they forget that the most important thing isn’t making it to the top, but making it home. You can’t win, after all, if you don’t survive.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For those of us outside the situation, likely with no plans to climb Everest, the idea of summit fever seems a bit ridiculous: reaching the summit isn’t worth someone’s life! But for those on the top of the mountain, turning their backs on a dream that’s so close they can see it is much harder. Plus, the incredible amounts of energy spent climbing the mountain stresses the body and impairs the mind—conditions that the defaults use to subvert your carefully laid plans and prevent you from reaching your true objectives.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Climbing Everest is a dramatic example of why it’s important to implement execution fail-safes to ensure your decision gets executed as planned. Is it finally time to bail when you’re running out of oxygen? Should you stay the course even though your other equipment is on its last legs? Execution fail-safes leverage your thinking when you’re at your best to protect you against the defaults when you’re at your worst.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The idea of an execution fail-safe is well illustrated by the Greek myth of Ulysses. Ulysses was the captain of his ship. He and his crew were navigating close to the island inhabited by the Sirens, dangerous creatures that lured sailors to their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_206" role="doc-pagebreak" title="206"/>deaths with their song—a song so beautiful that it drove crews mad with longing till they ran their ships against the rocks trying to reach its source.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Ulysses wanted to hear the Sirens’ song without risking the lives of his crew. Now, I’m not saying that Ulysses made a great decision here. If he’d really thought through his options using the principles and safeguards I’ve outlined, he would’ve steered clear of the island. But that’s not the part I love about the story. What I love is that Ulysses implemented fail-safes to ensure his decision was executed as planned.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He stuffed the ears of his crew with beeswax so they couldn’t hear the song as they approached the island. And to prevent them from changing course, he had them tie him to the mast so that no matter what he said or did in the madness of the song, he couldn’t influence them or change the decision he’d already made. He also instructed them that the more he struggled and insisted on changing course, the tighter they should bind him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Ulysses’s clever implementation of execution fail-safes allowed him to hear the song while ensuring the safety of his crew. Of course, fail-safes are indispensable in a lot of other contexts too.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">Three Kinds of Execution Fail-Safes</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">There are three kinds of execution fail-safes you should know: setting trip wires, empowering others to make decisions, and tying your hands.</p>
			<aside>
				<p class="x10-Sidebar-Box-Text-First"><span class="_0-Sidebar-Box-Run-in">fail-safe:</span> Set up trip wires to determine in advance what you’ll do when you hit a specific quantifiable time, amount, or circumstance.</p>
			</aside>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_207" role="doc-pagebreak" title="207"/>Trip wires are forms of precommitment—you commit yourself in advance to a course of action when certain conditions arise. For example, a team climbing Everest might set up a trip wire by committing themselves to abort their summit attempt if they don’t reach a certain location by a certain time. If the team fails, they turn back! No argument. They don’t try to decide in the midst of fatigue and oxygen deprivation; they’ve already decided and are already committed to turning around.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The path to success and failure is marked if you know where to look. The journey always contains the answers. Trip wires include both negative signs and the absence of positive signs. When the signs are positive, you know to stay the course. When things are murkier, however, that’s when it helps to set trip wires.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Negative signs are red flags that something is going seriously off course. The sooner you catch yourself going the wrong way, the easier it is to turn back. The other day I ended up going east on the highway when I wanted to go west. Only when I noticed the wrong city was getting closer did I realize my mistake! But negative signs aren’t the only ones to take note of. Sometimes the absence of positive signs is itself a sign.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When you don’t see the positive signs you expected, it doesn’t necessarily mean things have gone wrong. It does mean this is a moment worth paying attention to. Many projects fail, and many decisions get challenging right at this point—when people see neither negative signs nor the positive ones they expected. When that happens, it’s time to re-evaluate. Ask yourself, “Is the most important thing still the most important thing? Was I wrong? What will it take to reach my goals now that I’ve moved further in time but not in progress?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">By having clear trip wires in place before you start, you <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_208" role="doc-pagebreak" title="208"/>increase the odds of success. When the entire team understands clearly the markers of success and failure, they are empowered to act the minute things veer off course.</p>

			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Great leaders know that things don’t always go according to plan. They also know they can’t be everywhere at once. Teams need to know how to adapt when circumstances change. And circumstances change all the time.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Giving a team enough structure to carry out a mission but enough flexibility to respond to changing circumstances is called <i>commander’s intent</i>—a military term first applied to the Germans who were trying to defeat Napoleon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If you’ve ever been on the inside of a business where employees can’t take action until everything is approved by their boss, you’re seeing what happens without commander’s intent. There’s a single point of failure. If something happens to the boss, the business and mission fail.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Commander’s intent empowers each person on a team to initiate and improvise as they’re executing the plan. It stops you from being the bottleneck, and it enables the team to keep each other accountable to the goal without your presence.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Commander’s intent has four components: formulate, communicate, interpret, and implement. The first two components—formulate and communicate—are the responsibility of the senior commander. You must communicate the strategy, the rationale, and the operational limits to the team. Tell them not just what to do, but why to do it, how you arrived at your decision, so they understand the context, as well <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_209" role="doc-pagebreak" title="209"/>as the boundaries for effective action—what is completely off the table. Subordinate commanders then have the tools for the last two components: interpreting the changing contexts and implementing the strategy in those contexts.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Before you begin executing a decision, just so there’s no confusion as you move forward, ask yourself:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">Who needs to know my goals and the outcomes I’m working toward?</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted">Do they know what the most important objective is?</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">Do they know the positive and negative signs to look for and what trip wires are attached to them?</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">One sign that you’ve failed to empower your team is that you can’t be away from the office for a week without things falling apart. Some leaders think it makes them indispensable—that the team’s inability to function without them is a sign of how important they are. Don’t be fooled! This is the ego default at work. Effective leaders shouldn’t have to be available 24/7 for their team to make decisions and achieve objectives. If you can’t be away, it doesn’t mean that you’re indispensable or a supremely competent leader; it means that you’re an incompetent communicator.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another sign that you’re in the grips of the ego default is that you insist on controlling how everything happens. Good leaders determine what needs to get done and set the parameters for getting there. They don’t care whether something gets done differently from how they themselves would’ve done it. As long as it advances to the objective within the limits they’ve set, they’re satisfied.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Poor leaders insist that everything must be done their way, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_210" role="doc-pagebreak" title="210"/>which ultimately demoralizes their team and undermines both loyalty and creativity—exactly the opposite of commander’s intent.</p>
			<aside>
				<p class="x10-Sidebar-Box-Text-First"><span class="_0-Sidebar-Box-Run-in">fail-safe:</span> Tie your hands to keep your execution on track.</p>
			</aside>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Ulysses used trip wires and commander’s intent to safeguard his decision. He also had the crew tie his hands—a final execution fail-safe to ensure he followed through with his decision, and the reason this kind of safeguard is known as a <i>Ulysses pact</i>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tying your hands amounts to different things in different contexts. If you’re dieting, tying your hands might mean ridding your home of all junk food so there’s nothing to tempt you. If you’re investing, it might mean creating automated deposits each month. If you’re climbing Everest, tying your hands might mean securing an agreement from everyone that the team will turn around if they don’t reach the halfway point by a certain time.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Whatever decision you’re facing, ask yourself, “Is there a way to make sure I will stick to the path I’ve decided is best?” By thinking through your options, and precommitting to courses of action, you free up space to tackle other problems.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Even if we’re waiting as long as possible to decide, we now know exactly what to focus on and do when the time comes to make our decision. We’ve set our trip wires, we’ve empowered people to act on them, and we’ve tied our hands so that we can’t undo all our good work in a moment of stress.</p>
