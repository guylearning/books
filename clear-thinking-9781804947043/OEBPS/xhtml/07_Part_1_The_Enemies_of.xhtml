			<p class="x02-PO-Body-Text"><span class="_2-PO-Text-1st-Line-Run-In">THE FIRST THING </span>I heard was shouting. Generally, this is not what you expect to hear when approaching the CEO’s office. This CEO was different.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">I walked into his office, put my briefcase on the table, and sat down directly across from him. He didn’t <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2" role="doc-pagebreak" title="2"/>acknowledge my presence. While months of working for him had led me to expect as much, it was still unsettling.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">I was his designated right hand, and almost nothing and no one got to him without going through me first. That’s what made this call so interesting. It wasn’t on his calendar.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">Whomever he was talking with, the conversation had turned him red with rage. I had already learned the hard way not to interrupt him during moments like this with a nudge to take a breath. If I did, his wrath would quickly direct itself at me.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">As he hung up, his eyes met mine. I knew I had a split second to say something, or he’d start yelling at me for having to take this unscheduled call.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">“What was that all about?” I asked.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">“They needed to be put in their place,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">I didn’t know who had been on the other end of the phone, but the pitch of his anger led me to believe it was someone unfamiliar with him. The people who worked for this CEO knew it was easier not to tell him anything that might upset him. This included bad news, ideas that clashed with his beliefs, and of course a nudge to stop when he was making a situation worse.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">It would be one of the last calls he ever took in his office. This ordinary moment changed everything.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">It turned out, the person on the other end of that phone call was desperately trying to report a problem with serious consequences for the organization. When their concern was met with wrath that day, they decided to take their concerns to the board. Not long afterward, the CEO was fired.</p>
			<p class="x02-Part-Body-Text">While part of me wants to tell you it was directly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3" role="doc-pagebreak" title="3"/>because of his behavior, we both know that wouldn’t be true. He was fired for not acting on the very information the person on the other end of the phone was trying to tell him, because his ego wouldn’t allow for it. If he had been thinking clearly, he might still have his job.<a class="Footnote-Reference" epub:type="noteref" href="46_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1" id="footnote-004-backlink" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*]</a><span class="Footnote-reference">*</span></p>
