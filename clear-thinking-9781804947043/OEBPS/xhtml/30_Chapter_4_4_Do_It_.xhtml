			<h2 class="x03-Chapter-Title" id="_idParaDest-53">Do it!</h2>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">You’ve considered the options. You’ve evaluated them. You’ve found the best. It’s time to act!</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There is no purpose to knowing what you should do and not doing it. If you want results, you need action.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Making a judgment and executing it is easier than it seems and harder than others imagine. One reason we fail to take action is that we’re scared to deal with the consequences. It’s not so much that we don’t know what to do as much as we don’t want to deal with the reality of doing it. We don’t want to have conversations, because they might hurt people’s feelings. We don’t want to fire the person that we like, even though we know they’re wrong for the job.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Our ego conspires with the social default and the inertia default to weaken our resolve and keep us from doing what we need to do. But that’s not the only reason we fail to act.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another big reason we find action hard is that we’re afraid of being wrong. In this case inertia holds us in place as we gather more and more information in the false hope that we can ultimately eliminate uncertainty.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_184" role="doc-pagebreak" title="184"/>There are three principles that can help you know when to stop deliberating and start acting. But first, let’s discuss a helpful way of categorizing decisions by considering how <i>consequential</i> they are, and how <i>reversible</i> they are.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A">Consequentiality and Reversibility</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Consequential decisions affect the things that matter most: whom you marry, where you live, which business you launch. The more a decision affects what matters to you—either in the short term or the long term—the more consequential it is.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Reversible decisions can be undone by a later course of action. The harder or more costly it is to undo a decision’s effects, the less reversible it is. It’s easy to eat a chocolate bar, but once you’ve eaten it, it’s done. You can’t undo it. Having a baby is the same. Once you have one, you can’t undo it (nor would you want to!). At the other extreme would be a decision whose effects cost nothing to undo. I can decide to sign up for a free fourteen-day trial of something, knowing full well it’s easy to undo.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We can represent different kinds of decisions in terms of their degrees of consequence and reversibility on a graph (see the following figure). Among these decisions, two types deserve special attention: decisions that are highly consequential and irreversible, and decisions that are inconsequential and highly reversible.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When a decision is highly consequential and irreversible, its effects ripple throughout your life, and there’s no way to stop them. Some people call these “lead dominoes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When decisions are like lead dominoes, the cost of a mistake is high. Exactly the opposite is true of a decision that’s inconsequential and easily reversed. The cost of a mistake is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_185" role="doc-pagebreak" title="185"/>low: if you don’t like the outcome, you can just reverse it. The biggest mistake in cases like these is wasting time and mental energy. If you can take something back, or it doesn’t really matter, continuing to gather information becomes a drain on resources.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If you’ve ever bought a mattress, you’ll know exactly what I mean. You spend hours—if not days—looking at mattresses, reading reviews, comparing prices, and considering whether you’re a hot or cold sleeper. You finally decide on a mattress, and have it delivered, only to find that it isn’t what you dreamed of. So you exchange it for your fallback option anyway. You could have saved hours or days simply ensuring the store had a flexible return policy, deciding on a mattress within an hour, and moving on. When the cost of a mistake is low, move fast.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-Head-A"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_186" role="doc-pagebreak" title="186"/>Three Principles for Action</h3>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Now that we have a way of categorizing decisions by their degrees of consequence and revisability, let’s talk about some principles. The first is this:</p>
			<aside>
				<p class="x10-Sidebar-Box-Text-First"><span class="_0-Sidebar-Box-Run-in">the asap principle:</span> If the cost to undo the decision is low, make it as soon as possible.</p>
			</aside>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">In fact, if something is too inconsequential, then engaging in <i>any</i> decision-making might be a waste. Just choose. Decide quickly, and learn by doing. You’ll save time, energy, and resources that you can use for decisions that really matter.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">If, on the other hand, the decision is highly consequential and irreversible, then the stakes are high. The biggest risk here is moving too fast and missing something important. You want to gather as much information as you can before deciding. Therefore, the second principle is:</p>
			<aside>
				<p class="x10-Sidebar-Box-Text-First"><span class="_0-Sidebar-Box-Run-in">the alap principle:</span> If the cost to undo a decision is high, make it as late as possible.</p>
			</aside>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Remember to factor the cost of analysis into your decisions. This is something many people fail to do. Most decisions require an art that balances speed and accuracy. When you move too slowly on small decisions, you waste time and energy, no matter how accurate you may be. When you go too fast, you miss crucial information, make assumptions, overlook the basics, rush to judgment, and often solve the wrong problem. When things are hectic, however—even when speed matters—you need to slow down, just a little.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_187" role="doc-pagebreak" title="187"/>Michael Lewis gives an example of this in <i>The Undoing Project</i> about a woman who crashed head on into another car.<a class="Endnote-Reference" href="40_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber44" id="SuperscriptNumber44" role="doc-noteref" title="note">[1]</a> Medics rushed her to Sunnybrook Hospital, which is located next to Canada’s busiest stretch of highway. Sunnybrook had a reputation for treating the emergencies and traumas that come from car crashes, yet the woman had so many broken bones, the physicians missed some. Don Redelmeier was the Sunnybrook epidemiologist. His job was to “check the understanding of the specialists for mental errors.” He was there, in other words, to check other people’s thinking. “Wherever there is uncertainty there has got to be judgment,” said Redelmeier, “and wherever there is judgment there is an opportunity for human fallibility.” Doctors may be experts, but they’re still human, still fallible, and to complicate things further, their patients often give them unreliable information.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When things move fast, and life-and-death decisions need to be made, we often see only the things we’re specifically trained to see, and miss others that are nevertheless relevant. In this case, the woman presented another problem beyond all the broken bones: her heartbeat was highly irregular. Before she lost consciousness, she mentioned a history of an overactive thyroid, which is a classic cause of an irregular heartbeat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Redelmeier entered as the team looking after her was preparing to administer the drugs for hyperthyroidism: “[He] asked everyone to slow down. To wait. Just a moment. Just to check their thinking—and to make sure they were not trying to force the facts into an easy, coherent, but ultimately false story.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He wanted to slow things down because they had leaped to a conclusion that seemed to fit without considering other reasons: “Hyperthyroidism is a classic cause of an irregular heart rhythm, but hyperthyroidism is an infrequent cause of an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_188" role="doc-pagebreak" title="188"/>irregular heart rhythm,” he would say later. While it fit, it was unlikely—possible but not probable.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The staff began searching for other causes, and quickly determined she had a collapsed lung. “Like her fractured ribs, her collapsed lung had failed to turn up on the X-ray. Unlike the fractured ribs, it could kill her.” They ignored the thyroid and treated the collapsed lung, and her heartbeat returned to normal. When her official thyroid tests came back the next day, they were normal. As Redelmeier said, “You need to be so careful when there is one simple diagnosis that instantly pops into your mind that beautifully explains everything all at once. That’s when you need to stop and check your thinking.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When the stakes are high, and there are no take-backs, you want to decide at the last moment possible, and keep as many options on the table as you can while continuing to gather information.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In driver’s education, we learn that when you’re on the freeway driving at high speeds, you need to keep a pocket open in front of you in case someone unexpectedly veers into your lane or stops abruptly. Keeping extra distance between cars allows you to keep options open for whatever might happen. This is the same reason you should wait as long as possible when making an important decision. You want to give yourself as many options in the future so that if something changes, you have the space to maneuver and reposition yourself along the path of greatest opportunity.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">How do you know when it’s finally time to act?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When the cost of failure is cheap, the speed at which you come to a decision matters as much as the decision itself. When failure is expensive, it makes sense to learn more before taking action.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Defaults can transform caution into an excuse not to act if <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_189" role="doc-pagebreak" title="189"/>you don’t resist them. Anyone who has held on to a failing job, relationship, or investment too long knows that information gathering reaches a point of diminishing returns—at some point the cost of getting more information is exceeded by the cost of losing time or opportunity.</p>
			<div class="width_80">
				<img alt="" class="fill" id="image_page_189" src="../images/Art03_DecideALAPgraph.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A friend of mine works with engineers. He says they tend to be highly risk averse: they wait as long as possible to decide and can’t tell when they should act more quickly. “They keep thinking that gathering more data will make things firmer,” he said, “but they’ve already been prototyping and gathering information for months. They don’t know when to stop and commit. They start losing interest in the problem too, because all they’re doing is having meetings, aligning, gathering information, and writing up a giant document laying out how they made their decision. They’re all aware of basic decision-making skills, but they really, really struggle to know when enough is enough.” And it’s not just engineers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_190" role="doc-pagebreak" title="190"/>Decision-makers at large have become increasingly susceptible to analysis paralysis because so much data has become available to them. If you’ve ever struggled with analysis paralysis, a third principle can help you know when to stop deliberating and start acting:</p>
			<aside>
				<p class="x10-Sidebar-Box-Text-First"><span class="_0-Sidebar-Box-Run-in">the stop, flop, know principle:</span> Stop gathering more information and execute your decision when either you Stop gathering useful information, you First Lose an OPportunity (FLOP), or you come to Know something that makes it evident what option you should choose.</p>
			</aside>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Let’s consider the Stop, FLOP, and Know conditions one at a time.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">First, when you’ve stopped gathering useful information, it’s time to act. More information isn’t always better, and there are signs that you’ve gathered enough. When I interviewed <i>The Princeton Review</i> co-founder Adam Robinson,<a class="Endnote-Reference" href="40_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber45" id="SuperscriptNumber45" role="doc-noteref" title="note">[2]</a> for instance, he told me about a seminal study done by a psychologist named Paul Slovic back in 1974 that illustrates the folly of gathering too much information.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Slovic put eight horse handicappers in the same room and told them he wanted to see how well they could predict the winners of forty horse races, over four rounds of ten races each. In the first round each handicapper was given any five pieces of information he wanted on each horse. One handicapper might want the height and weight of the jockey; another might want the highest finish a horse had ever had. The handicappers also had to state how confident they were in their predictions.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the end of the first round, with only five pieces of information, they were 17 percent accurate. Given there were ten horses to a race, they were 70 percent better than the 10 percent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_191" role="doc-pagebreak" title="191"/>chance they’d have with zero information. They were 19 percent confident in their predictions, which isn’t too far from their actual results.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Each round gave them more and more information. For round two they were given ten pieces of information, then twenty in round three, and forty in the fourth and final round.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the final round, they were still only 17 percent accurate. The thirty-five additional pieces of information did, however, move their confidence level to 34 percent. All of the extra information made them no more accurate but a lot more confident.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Confidence increases faster than accuracy. “The trouble with too much information,” Robinson told me, “is you can’t reason with it.” It only feeds confirmation bias. We ignore additional information that doesn’t agree with our assessment, and gain confidence from additional information that does.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In my life and in the lives of people I’ve worked with, these are some signs you’ve hit the limit of useful information you can gather:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">You are able to argue credibly for and against the options you’re considering from all angles.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted">You’re stretching for insight by asking people for advice who are more than one step removed from the problem or who don’t have experience solving problems of this sort.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">You feel like you need to learn more, but you’ve stopped learning new things, and are instead in a constant loop reviewing the same information (or same arguments) over and over.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When you’ve hit any of these points, you’ve probably gotten all the useful information you’re going to get. It’s time to decide. That’s Stop, now let’s move on to FLOP.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_192" role="doc-pagebreak" title="192"/>If you’re facing a highly consequential and irreversible decision, and you’re waiting as long as possible to make up your mind, the time to decide is when you start losing opportunities. For example, if you’re selling a house, you might want to wait as long as possible to actually sell it. You go as far as listing it, setting a price, and getting offers, but when buyers start walking away, or you’re about to break a legal contract, then you’re starting to lose options, and it’s time to act.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Likewise, suppose your partner wants to take your relationship to the next level—be it going exclusive, living together, or getting engaged. Those are big defining moments in your relationship, and if you’re unsure, it makes sense to take your time deciding. But eventually your partner is going to get fed up and walk away. Right before that happens, when your partner makes it clear that you’re on the threshold of losing options, it’s time to decide.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Remember, the rationale behind the ALAP Principle is to preserve optionality. When options start diminishing, it’s time to act using whatever information you have. That’s FLOP: if you’re waiting to decide, wait no longer than your First Lost Opportunity.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It’s finally time to act when you come to know something that makes it clear what you should do. Sometimes you gather a critical piece of information that makes your decision easy, perhaps a First Lost Opportunity. Other times, especially in more ambiguous situations like relationships, it’s just a gut feeling that doesn’t go away or change. Either way, there’s always a moment when you simply know at a core level exactly what to do.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Knowing what to do isn’t enough, though. You have to take action.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Do it!</p>
