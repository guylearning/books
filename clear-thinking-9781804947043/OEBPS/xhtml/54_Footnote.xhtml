They learn the basics enough to be average, then look for the secret, shortcut, or hidden knowledge. Mastering the basics is the key to being ruthlessly effective. The basics might seem simple but that doesn’t mean they’re simplistic. The best in the world probably don’t have some secret shortcut or hidden knowledge. They merely understand the fundamentals better than others. My favorite example of this is Warren Buffett’s saying “The first rule of investing is to never lose money.” Despite the lifetime of wisdom behind it, people dismiss it as too simple. An exercise in thinking comes from reasoning your way to this insight through first principles from the ground up.</span></p>
