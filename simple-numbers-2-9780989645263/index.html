<p class="sc"><i class="calibre8">I can only dream as far as I can see…<br class="calibre9" />And when I get there, I can always see farther.</i></p>
<p class="center">&ndash; Anonymous</p>
<p class="noindent1a">The quote above is so true in my case. This book is just another stage of seeing farther than I could have ever imagined. As I looked at the data of many businesses through the lens of my previous book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits! </i>(2011), my process continued to evolve as I searched for financial truth through Simple Numbers.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2014 I was honored to contribute to Verne Harnish’s book, <i class="calibre8">Scaling Up</i>. It gave me an opportunity to share some of my latest thinking on how to manage profitability through labor efficiency. I showed an example of a common technique I use to isolate components of labor and hold them accountable to an output measure.</p>
<p class="noindent">Through my consulting practice, my team continues to see many companies plagued by bad data that is provided late to the business owner. The accountant thinks they must get it right, which is a noble thought, but it leads to rigid rules that are difficult to apply; and by the time the data is released, its value for analytics has long passed. Business owners dream about timely, useful data. My consulting team delivers it to them, and we train their staff on how to repeatedly provide it.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-119" class="calibre4"></a>I was fortunate to have some great entrepreneurs as clients, and my fellow Entrepreneurs’ Organization forum members taught me how accountants should work with them. Accounting standards are needed, but there is a whole world of alternative data presentation methods that often produce better financial truth for running a business. It is my job to provide both data sets: one for running the business, and one for banks and other external data users. But an interesting thing is happening. Once the banks and other users see the alternative data we prepare, they stop asking for traditional presentations and use just the management view (with proper disclosure on how it differs).</p>
<p class="noindent">As our work started to significantly improve companies’ profitability, it opened up more possibilities for them to scale up, and it led me to look not at just profitability, but also, and more importantly, at return on invested capital as the number one key to focus on. In 2016 I was asked to chair an executive education program for the Entrepreneurs’ Organization that was held at the Wharton School, which is the business school at the University of Pennsylvania. The school’s director of executive education, David Wessels, is an expert on return on invested capital concepts. Hearing Professor Wessels teach on this topic helped me formulate my own ideas about how return on invested capital applies to private companies. I then developed models to evaluate new business investments, and I created a new way to monitor performance and return on investment.</p>
<p class="noindent">As entrepreneurs learn to view their business as an investment vehicle that must provide a return to their investor, they see the enormous power of a privately held business to realize 50% to 100% returns from their invested capital, year, over year, without selling the business. This is why significant wealth can be created from owning a business if (a) you possess the skill to lead it, (b) you have the capital to launch it, and (c) you have the discipline to leave the after-tax profits in it to grow.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-120" class="calibre4"></a>This book is designed to give business owners and their teams the necessary understanding to scale smartly, know when to reinvest profits, and know when to harvest profits for other opportunities. By following the principles I outline in this book, you will have the tools needed to create a valuable, profitable business that will reap great financial reward, whether you keep it or sell it.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is my hope this book will let you dream farther, and see farther still once you get there.<a id="calibre_link-313" class="calibre4"></a></p>

<p class="sc">”<i class="calibre8">A man who aims at nothing hits it with<br class="calibre9" />amazing accuracy. Improve your aim,<br class="calibre9" />improve your odds!”</i></p>
<p class="center">&ndash; Greg Crabtree</p>
<p class="noindent1a">I am fortunate to interact with many successful entrepreneurs and get to know the real story of how they achieved success. Through our consulting and accounting practice, we see the most intimate details of those businesses, and I have enough gray hairs to have seen many of them from start to exit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Most people think business is complex, but there is a simple overarching structure to most things, and I believe I have discovered three simple rules to achieve launch <i class="calibre8">and </i>sustainability <i class="calibre8">and </i>a successful exit:</p>

<ol class="calibre10">
<li value="1" class="calibre11">Figure out what the market needs.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre11">Find a way to do it profitably.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre11">Achieve a 50% or better pretax return on invested capital (ROIC), year over year.</li>
</ol>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Does It Meet a Market Need?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Entrepreneurs have generally been pretty good at figuring this part out. It is not complex; find an unmet need and see what the market will pay for a product or service that fills the gap. It does <a id="calibre_link-204" class="calibre4"></a>not have to be something new; it could just be a new way of interfacing with the customer.</p>
<p class="noindent">When we reimagined what entrepreneurs need from an accounting firm, it started with finding out what business owners were not getting from the profession. I used my Entrepreneurs’ Organization forum as my focus group since they fit the profile of who I wanted as clients, but I could not do business with them according to forum rules. This allowed for an unusually strong focus group since they were not my clients, but they were motivated to help me run a better business. The focus group identified the following needs:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Elimination of tax day surprises: </i>Require at least a quarterly review of current-year tax implications, and set aside tax funds as they are earned rather than paying taxes one year behind.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Fixed-price billing: </i>If you bill by the hour, you are either giving away your expertise or charging for your ignorance.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Having an idea of what works (and what does not): </i>The accounting profession lost sight of helping their clients run best-in-class businesses and became more focused on selling billable hours that do not add value. They overlooked the fact that they had the data in their hands to research best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">All of this understanding led our practice away from being a CPA firm that did consulting when it was not tax season to being a consulting firm that provides CPA services only to clients we consult with. We now bill only on a fixed-price basis, and we have essentially turned our services into products. (The only exception is outsourced bookkeeping.) Our focus has changed to studying the data that is in front of us each day, and we develop our own beliefs about critical success factors in business. As a <a id="calibre_link-116" class="calibre4"></a>result, we can help when we have a client who wants to create a planned outcome, instead of simply providing a commodity service.</p>
<p class="noindent">Commodity services are still needed, but they come with the burden of having lower margins, and the services are usually delivered by bigger, more capitalized businesses that make competition difficult. If I can find my niche, the “bigs” will have trouble competing, and I can be more profitable with much less revenue.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Can You Do It Profitably?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Now that you have an idea to fill a market need, can you deliver it in a way that will appeal to customers and still make a profit? This is usually where entrepreneurs get trapped into revenue thinking instead of margin thinking. Part of the solution to better serve your customers may be reselling someone else’s goods or services and adding your labor to tie it all together. Think of those outside goods and services as pass-through costs because they are bait to attract the more profitable part of the transaction that you perform.</p>
<p class="noindent">In my previous book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!</i>, I hypothesized that at 5% profit you would barely break even in cash flow, at 10% you would have a good business, and at 15% you would have a great business. I came up with those levels by observation, and they still work for about 70% of businesses. However, I saw that there were outliers that could have a lower profit and still were great businesses. Many of them had low gross margins and relied on volume, but others who tried this strategy failed miserably. I also noticed that some businesses attempted high-margin models and failed, so margin had to be just one element of the solution. There was a missing piece. The trail to solve the mystery led me to the document most entrepreneurs struggle to understand and rarely look at: the balance sheet!</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-121" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Does It Meet the Minimum ROIC Standard?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">I discovered the missing piece when I started researching ROIC. Later I will detail how to measure and evaluate that metric and how to use it to set your profit target. The questions are: Of the capital I invest into my business, does net income provide a reasonable return? Do I have access to the required capital through my own cash, investors, or debt?</p>
<p class="noindent">To whet your appetite for the later discussion of ROIC, let me tease you with a number: 50%. Based on our research for businesses in the US and Canada, the minimum acceptable ROIC should be no less than 50%, and the average across most industries is 75%.</p>
<p class="noindent">I have often said that if someone can demonstrate their ability to run a profitable business, it is not that hard to get access to capital. The challenge is how to demonstrate you can do it if you do not have the capital to pull it off yourself. This is when you can develop a minimum viable product, create a “test kitchen,” or start small with what you can fund to prove the concept. After the proof of concept, outside capital is often not needed for growth. You can grow as fast as you can manage it just by reinvesting your own profits with perhaps some temporary financing from the bank. Certainly, some big initiatives require a lot of infrastructure, but the vast majority of new initiatives do not. The business grows by adding the next productive team member, the next profitable customer, the next profitable location&mdash;one at a time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since we have been using this approach to help our clients evaluate growth and new business initiatives, it really makes them pause when a new plan has no potential to meet the 50% ROIC standard, and it sheds light on why nobody else may have been successful. If you are in this situation, see if you can change either the profitability or the capital requirement.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-103" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Can You Change the Profitability?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">The error most entrepreneurs make in estimating profit is to start with a cost-build-up pricing model to determine what they should charge. While I agree that costs are important, I prefer to start with the price my target customer is willing to pay, then see what the minimum cost would be to deliver.</p>
<p class="noindent">Smaller niche businesses have more pricing power since they are not big enough to attract a predatory well-funded large business to drive the price down through competition. Leveraging technology to enhance labor productivity is another key to profitability. Also, never forget that plain old world-class execution is your best protection from competitors and is a profit generator. Very few businesses can really deliver.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another way to look at profitability enhancement is to share part of the transaction with another business, particularly if you have weaknesses in some aspect of fulfillment. Good metrics show that 30% to 40% of any transaction’s value is the sales, marketing, and customer service component, whereas delivery of the product or service is 60% to 70%. If you can share the customer with someone else, you can negotiate good terms that specify you do not pay them until you get paid, which lowers your capital need. We will look at that in detail later when we discuss the capital signature of your business model.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Can You Change the Capital Requirement?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">It has been enlightening to see our clients respond to the challenge of reducing their capital requirements when their business idea falls short of the 50% return. The best time to get better terms from your suppliers and customers is when you start a new activity. Once customers and vendors become accustomed to your terms, it is difficult to change them unless you are in a power position. Even if you have power, it can sometimes <a id="calibre_link-86" class="calibre4"></a>damage the relationship and possibly damage your customer or vendor as well since they are not prepared for the change.</p>
<p class="noindent">For starters, here are a few techniques to reduce your capital requirements:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Try to get the entire payment in advance, or get as large of a payment as possible in advance, as long as the remaining payment does not take so long that it negates the benefit of the up-front payment.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Maintain tighter inventory control over slow-moving stock (but never run out of key items).</li>
<li class="calibre11">Take credit card payments for some or all transactions. Even though your merchant fee can be 2% to 3%, it might be worth it if you lack capital to fund the activity, not to mention the labor cost of chasing down payments and bad debts. One of my favorite Gregisms is “Never make it hard for someone to give you money.”</li>
<li class="calibre11">Get extended terms from vendors if you are selling products or subcontracted services. It is common for a company’s subcontractors to get paid after the company itself gets paid.</li>
<li class="calibre11">For ongoing services, charge a fixed monthly fee that keeps you equal to or slightly ahead of the effort required to provide those services. If the start of services requires up-front effort, try to offset it with an up-front fee that equals or exceeds the cost of the initial effort so you do not dig a cash hole from the start.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Turn a capital cost into an operating expense. If your activity requires equipment or a retail store buildout, finance the cost and turn the payment into an operating <a id="calibre_link-160" class="calibre4"></a>expense over the useful life of the item being financed. Your profit will be lower because of the payment, but your yield will still be accelerated. If you use financing, you need to have a greater certainty of success and you need to be willing to pay off the debt if the business fails.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Understanding these three rules is a great example of the Hawthorne Effect, where people modify their behavior just because they are being observed. When we educated one of our clients in the staffing industry on the interrelationship of these rules, they created new offerings for their customers that were more profitable, they got paid faster, and the customer got a project billing structure they preferred over standard hourly billing. That led to profit going from 3% to 10% and ROIC rising from 23% to 51%. Half of the rise in ROIC was due to the profit, but the other half was due to needing less capital because they were getting paid faster. They saw more opportunity once they were aware of the power to be found in the interplay of these three rules. In other words, they went from playing checkers to playing chess!</p>
<p class="noindent">The good thing about being an entrepreneur is that you get to decide on the strategy. If you match the market need to the profit model and the capital model, you will be successful&mdash;assuming you can execute!</p>

<p class="center">&ndash; Warren Buffett</p>
<p class="noindent1a">A great error for entrepreneurs is to not think like an investor. Whether you are just starting a business or have owned one for many years, you must think like an investor to maximize the value of your business. For most industries, you should take more of a long-term investor mindset like Warren Buffett would&mdash; patient and demanding but seeking the balance of profitability and growth. If you are in the tech industry, you must have a faster internal clock since your business can become irrelevant much faster. To help my clients understand how their business fits their investment thinking, I have developed the following structure that encompasses every business model I have worked with.</p>
</div>

<div id="calibre_link-281" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-314"><b class="calibre5">The Three Business Value Plays</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Many entrepreneurs hear about companies that were sold and made them rich, and they get motivated to make the same thing happen for them. This can be a good thing if the entrepreneur’s characteristics match those in the success story they heard, but unfortunately, most of the time they do not. Because I am often faced with this situation among my clients, I put some thought and <a id="calibre_link-175" class="calibre4"></a>research into how I can frame the situation to give them direction, and I came up with the following three business value plays:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Run to harvest</li>
<li class="calibre11">Harvest to premium sale</li>
<li class="calibre11">Build to sell</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">We have clients in all three of these scenarios. It is important to understand the differences so you can implement an effective strategy.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-282" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-315"><b class="calibre5">Run to Harvest</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Run to harvest is the most common business model among privately held businesses, and it has made many entrepreneurs significantly wealthy. When this type of business is run at its best, it can be very profitable, but it may be operationally difficult to scale. It usually does not have recurring revenue streams for any great length of time. Customers may be loyal, or “sticky,” but only to the owner or a key staff member.</p>
<p class="noindent">This type of business also struggles to exceed much more than $5 million in revenue, which keeps it below the target of private equity funds as a purchase target. As a rule, this type of business attracts only four to five times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) as a sale value, and much of that is subject to an earnout because of the perceived lack of stickiness of the customers and the difficulty of continued operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">While those may seem like negatives, business owners who have this type of business might still achieve significant wealth creation if they follow the principles outlined in my first book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits! </i>It is imperative that business owners pay themselves a market wage for their role in <a id="calibre_link-94" class="calibre4"></a>the business (it is okay if that wage is at the top of the market), and they must use the after-tax profits of the business to smartly grow it as the market allows. Once the business has grown as far as the market allows, business owners should use the after-tax profits to diversify into other investments (such as another business, real estate, or the stock market). If you run your business on these principles, it will give you a better investment return than anything in real estate or the stock market, so be sure to fully capitalize your business before you do anything else with the profits.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-303" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-316"><b class="calibre5">Harvest to Premium Sale</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">When the harvest to premium sale model applies, it is my favorite strategy because it gives you the best of both worlds: you can keep your business and grow it, or you can sell it and get a significant premium on the sale.</p>
<p class="noindent">The main characteristic of this business model is very sticky customers. They are either contractually bound, or it costs them a lot to go elsewhere. We see this primarily in subscription software sales. It is not impossible for customers to switch software platforms, but they will not endure the pain and suffering involved unless the current platform is unbearable or someone else’s offering is too good to pass up.</p>
<p class="noindent">Just because your customers are under contract with you does not guarantee a premium sale. In government contracting, you are generally given only the value of current contracts because there are no guaranteed renewals. However, you may be paid a premium if you are an approved vendor under a broad contract that allows only a handful of other vendors to provide products and services. In essence, the buyer is paying a premium for your government contract as a hunting license for task orders and thinks they can outbid the other limited vendors.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-95" class="calibre4"></a>Premiums are sometimes paid for highly skilled teams that are hard to assemble. When the hiring market is competitive and a company needs to move fast, they can buy a small company, with a nice premium, to get their labor. We have seen businesses with under $5 million in revenue be paid one times revenue to acquire their team, even if the business is operating at breakeven or a loss.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ability to scale up is another key characteristic of the harvest to premium sale model. You might create a business that could scale, but you do not have the energy or passion for it, or maybe you do not want to risk the capital. Private equity firms love to look at these types of businesses and are willing to pay a premium, if you hold them to it. Therefore, it is always a good idea to plan how to scale, even if you sell your business to someone else and they scale it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Recurring revenue is always a hot incentive for buyers to offer a premium, but there is a good side and a bad side to this. On the good side, when recurring revenue fits the product or service, it works great. On the bad side, when you try to force a recurring revenue model onto a business where it does not fit, you can damage a good business and significantly underprice your services.</p>
<p class="noindent">The most common recurring revenue models are in maintenance services, such as for homes (pest control; alarm systems; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning etc.) or for software or equipment. Many businesses that resell technical equipment find they can take a very low margin on the original sale of the equipment if they also sell a three-year maintenance agreement. As I said earlier, if you focus on gross margin instead of revenue, you can get creative with structuring sales to give up margin in some areas and make it up in others. In the capital cost of the transaction, do not forget to factor in how long you can wait to get paid and when you have to pay your costs.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-114" class="calibre4"></a>The most common error in recurring revenue is trying to turn an inconsistently needed service into a monthly fee. You might be successful at selling it the first time, but the customer will not renew because they did not get value from regularly paying for something they do not always need. The worst case is when you agree to a service level you cannot afford. Either there is no contractual exit for scope creep, or there is no clear definition of when the scope has been exceeded.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-317"><b class="calibre5">Build to Sell</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Build to sell is the rarest value play. It can work, but it leaves a big crater when it fails. The most common example of this strategy is in software development, but we have also seen it used in harvest to premium sale models when the entrepreneur is great at getting a business off the ground but gets bored running it. In those cases, their strategy is to max out the reinvestment of aftertax profits and apply internal leverage to spur growth to an optimum sale point.</p>
<p class="noindent">In software development, you typically start with a minimum viable product and get some customers to provide market validation and feedback on needed enhancements. It is usually at this point when you decide to either attract outside capital or pass on outside investors if you can generate enough internal profits to fund development.</p>
<p class="noindent">Regardless of the industry, the critical piece is being sure the market values what you are building. My experience with a client tells a cautionary tale. The client had 45 stores in the retail outlet sector. The CEO (who was not the owner) and I had developed a maximum profit and value plan that said to hold growth at 45 stores, which was the maximum capacity of their central warehouse. The plan was to close the five worst-performing stores each year and open five new stores in more promising markets. Given the structure of outlet mall leases for their store <a id="calibre_link-158" class="calibre4"></a>size, it was inexpensive to open a new store, rents were usually based on percentage of sales, and there was minimal cost to get out of a lease. The CEO and I agreed that in their niche there were probably not many more than 45 good store locations due to customer demand.</p>
<p class="noindent">The owner, on the other hand, came from a real estate background and always thought bigger was better and wanted to open more stores. The CEO and I explained that we did not think the market would support more than 45 store locations, their warehouse did not have the capacity to serve more stores than that, and, given that the owner liked to deplete all the cash after the Christmas sale season (which led to lean summers), the company did not have the capital to carry more stores. But the owner prevailed and gave the full-steam-ahead order to expand to 75 stores.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is where Ernest Hemingway comes in. In his book <i class="calibre8">The Sun</i> <i class="calibre8">Also Rises </i>there are two characters who have this discussion:</p>
<p class="bk">“How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked.</p>
<p class="bk">“Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.”</p>
<p class="noindent">I thank Pascal Finette at Singularity University for sharing this quote in a keynote address he gave at the EO San Francisco University in 2018. As soon as I heard the quote, it took me back to this experience. It is amazing how long a person can hang on even though a business is dead. It was not my business, but as an advisor I hated to witness the death march, waiting for one final event to push it over the edge.</p>
<p class="noindent">There will never be a premium sale in this type of situation, so if your business is gradually getting in trouble, seriously evaluate your realistic options so fate does not suddenly overcome you.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-147" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Examples of the Three Value Plays</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">To put these ideas in context, table 2.1 shows examples of the run to harvest, harvest to premium sale, and build to sell value plays. These examples are based on compiled client data (not a single client). The table is followed by discussions of each example to help you recognize which model your business uses and ensure your strategy aligns with your type of value play.</p>

<p class="scl"><a id="calibre_link-148" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Run to Harvest Example</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">This example is a composite of businesses in the in-home senior care industry, which sends caregivers into homes to help homebound patients with their daily needs. The following are decriptions of the key characteristics:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Customer funded: No. </i>There is very little opportunity to get paid in advance, so it is not a customer-funded business.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Recurring revenue: No. </i>While you might argue that the revenue is recurring, the average length of contracts does not support it. A few contracts could last beyond a year, but most fall well short of that time frame.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">High use of labor: Yes. </i>This is a labor-heavy industry that uses low-wage workers and occasionally nurses. The labor turnover can be high, and a lot of caregivers are needed to satisfy the staffing needs.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Sticky customers: No. </i>Some customers become very attached to a certain caregiver, and that can be good or bad. The customer is sticky to the caregiver, not the company, and if the favored caregiver is not available, the customer might look at your competitors.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Perceived scalability: Low. </i>Businesses in this industry are grown one case at a time and can get to sustainability within a year, but it is difficult to grow fast, and there tend to be only a few large companies with locations in multiple cities.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Ability to create: High. </i>There are multiple franchise opportunities, which bring independence, and an owner/ operator can launch with minimal capital and very few regulatory barriers in most areas.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-108" class="calibre4"></a>You may look at these characteristics as challenges, but many business owners in this industry have built great businesses that are profitable. In the example shown in table 2.1, this owner would be making $600,000 profit over their market wage of $150,000 to $175,000 per year. At this level of profit, they could easily have access to $300,000 of after-tax cash to invest in other things to build wealth. While the business might not sell for a premium, the owner would still get a decent price for the business, especially if they provide terms to facilitate the transaction in a sale to their management team. (There are pros and cons to that idea!) Given the limited barrier to entry and low up-front capital, this would still be a good business given the economics. To use a baseball analogy, this business will give you enough hits to make the Hall of Fame; you won’t strike out very often, but you won’t win the home run title.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-319"><b class="calibre5">Harvest to Premium Sale Example</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">This example is based on a product sales business. As in most businesses, it can be started with minimal capital (less than $20,000) and will build equity to $5 million by retaining some, but not all, profits each year. This business example is representative of what I call the “necessaries” type of business&mdash;nothing flashy or techie, just a well-run business providing what the market needs for a fair price and offering good customer service. The following are descriptions of the key characteristics:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Customer funded: No. </i>The company has to invoice its customers and carry inventory, although it gets some favorable vendor terms from its suppliers.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Recurring revenue: No. </i>The products they sell are consumable, so there is not a recurring supplies component.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">High use of labor: No. </i>Since the products they sell are manufactured on a contract basis, most labor is focused <a id="calibre_link-109" class="calibre4"></a>on sales and customer service, with a high leverage to margin per labor dollar.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Sticky customers: Yes. </i>Even though there are competing products, this company’s products are used in a process that would be annoying for their customers to change. This helps drive a premium.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Perceived scalability: Moderate. </i>The company’s products are widely used, and scaling up could result from attracting large customers with high-volume needs and executing an effective sales process.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Ability to create: Moderate. </i>The barrier is the capital need for initial setup and reaching initial sustainability. The products may have some patent protection, which helps boost the value, but most patents can be worked around, depending on your appetite for legal fees. The challenge is to win sticky customers who would need a reason to change suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Because of the sticky customers, perceived scalability, and ability to create, the sale of this business could attract a premium if the owner plays their cards right. By understanding what their business is worth, they could say no until a buyer offers a price that makes it worthwhile to sell, versus holding on until the next buyer comes along. When investor money is plentiful, the most common examples are roll-ups in industries like auto service, landscaping, equipment maintenance, and home services. Essentially, it is anything that has a recurring customer at a relatively fixed price for service that allows for gains from operational efficiency with size.</p>
<p class="scl"><a id="calibre_link-89" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Build to Sell Example</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">This example is based on a software subscription business. The vast majority of my software subscription clients have an eventual plan to sell their business. The speed of the process usually depends on whether they take outside funds or not. If they are profitable enough to fund their own development, I caution them to know when they are done.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-320"><b class="calibre5">The Fall of Peachtree Accounting</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">When you launch software to a niche market, you can charge a premium price, and there is a mutual benefit to you and your customers. But at some point you must test the broader market to grow, and sometimes that requires you to cannibalize your existing software pricing to reach the bigger market. When Peachtree Accounting launched back in the late 1980s, they charged $5,000 for their system. When QuickBooks launched, it cost around $300 and fit more users’ needs than Peachtree ever thought about. There was no way Peachtree was going to drop their price to compete with the upstart QuickBooks. Love them or hate them, QuickBooks became the dominant business accounting system by using the profits generated from their successful Quicken product to attack the business market.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">The following are descriptions of the key characteristics:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Customer funded: Yes</i>. Many customers might pay for a oneto three-year subscription, which is deferred revenue, so the business owner developed a strong understanding of the difference between profit and cash flow early in their business life.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-149" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">Recurring revenue: Yes. </i>When a company can provide core operating software for an industry, renewals can run between 60% and 80%. Those who do not renew typically never fully implemented and committed to using the software.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">High use of labor: No. </i>The cost of labor for ongoing development is not cheap, but not many skilled employees are needed. The sales process is reasonably efficient, but the sales cycle is long.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Sticky customers: Yes. </i>Once a customer implements the software, they are not likely to change.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Perceived scalability: High. </i>There is still plenty of market to penetrate. The software is mature, but a better sales process is needed.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Ability to create: Low. </i>It would be difficult to rebuild from scratch, and the slow sales cycle is a detriment to new competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In an example like this, the founders usually have to take less than a market wage in the beginning to reduce the initial burn rate. If you can get customers to pay up front, the company will have cash, and because you can use an accrual basis for taxes, you will have few tax consequences despite having cash because the tax is pushed into future years. The challenge in this example is how to not waste profits on ineffective sales and marketing and how to avoid making software enhancements that do not change potential customers’ buying choices.</p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes tech companies think they should spend all their profits to grow. I am all for that strategy when you have a good idea and execute it effectively. But if you are not effective, hold on to the profits until you have a really good idea of what will <a id="calibre_link-124" class="calibre4"></a>work. My consulting firm has seen this situation many times, so we developed a concept called launch capital that helps our clients be rigorous in holding reinvestments accountable. (I will talk about launch capital in Chapter 6.)</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not uncommon for companies in this situation to have multiple years as zero EBITDA, yet sell for anywhere between 2 and 10 times revenue. That can make up for some wasted profits that did not yield results, but there is some opportunity to harvest a bit of profit in most situations like this. Not every business can get that high a revenue multiplier, but each situation gives clues as to what the buyers will consider.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Understanding Your Business as an Investment</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">As a privately held business owner, you do not have a third party like the stock market to establish a share price for you on a daily basis. This is actually a blessing since the stock market daily price is full of emotion, and there is very little technical understanding of the true value of a business. Imagine what the stock price would be for a publicly traded business if there were total transparency of its current financial position, future plans, and forecasts, without any spin!</p>
<p class="noindent">If you, as the owner, establish an understanding of and a framework for valuing your business, you are the person who sets the value of your business on a consistent basis. This is critical if you have partners, decide to share equity with key team members, or have compensation plans based on growing the value of your business.</p>
<p class="noindent">But before we discuss the value of your business, you must first have an understanding of return on investment and, more importantly, return on invested capital (ROIC) of your business, which is likely the most valuable asset in your wealth profile.</p>
<p class="scl"><a id="calibre_link-106" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Rate of Return Expectation</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">As an experiment, find an entrepreneur who has not read this book or heard my speeches about rate of return, and ask them this simple question: what should you expect as an annual rate of return on your investment without selling your business? You will likely get answers that range from 10% to 20%. Those percentages come from the generally held belief that the stock market returns somewhere in that range over a period of 10-plus years. But this is a misunderstanding that stems from several points:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Public market returns are calculated off the market value at the time of investment, not invested capital.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Entrepreneurs do not understand the concept of invested capital.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Entrepreneurs do not have a commonly held definition of what a return on investment is.</li>
<li class="calibre11">There is a misperception that publicly traded companies have higher returns than private companies. This is why a discount is applied for lack of marketability when a private company is valued. Given the recent demand to purchase private businesses, you could argue that the discount for lack of marketability has been significantly reduced.</li>
</ul>

<div id="calibre_link-243" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-321"><b class="calibre5">Invested Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Think of invested capital as money you put in. Debt is not invested capital; it is just a placeholder that must eventually be replaced with real capital. Sweat equity (working a job in the business at less than market wage) can be, and should be, considered invested capital. It is money you put in, but you did not account for it properly. So for our discussions, invested capital is money that the owners put in, plus sweat equity.</p>
<p class="scl"><a id="calibre_link-97" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Returns</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">If you buy a bond or certificate of deposit, there is a stated interest rate. Quite simply, what you get in interest is your return on what you invested, and your rate of return is the interest divided by what you originally invested. You can often renew a certificate of deposit and leave some or all of the interest in it for reinvestment. When you add the interest, it increases your original investment. Most of these calculations use pretax returns for evaluation.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-258" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-322"><b class="calibre5">Sample Business Case</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Let’s apply the concepts of invested capital and returns to a sample business case. Your pretax profit is simply your annual return on your investment, and you have to pay tax on your profit. In this sample case, assume that the cash for taxes will come from the business, regardless of whether the business pays the tax directly or if the profit flows through to your personal tax return and you pay the tax personally. If you decide to leave some or all of the profits in the business, your invested capital increases by the amount you retain in the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">In table 2.2, the business owner invested $100,000 to start the business and performs a job within the business that should pay $100,000 per year, but they go without pay in the first year (sweat equity). This is the same as putting $200,000 into a business as an investor and hiring someone else to run it. After the first year, the owner begins to take a market wage but leaves the sweat equity in the invested capital calculation, remembering that it was a key part of the original investment.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 2.2</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Sample case: Invested capital and returns</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00026.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Table 2.2 assumes an average tax rate of 40% and assumes that all after-tax profits were left in the business as retained earnings, which also adds to the invested capital balance. This example is uncommon for a start-up business that does $1 million to $2 million in revenue during the first couple of years in business, mostly because many entrepreneurs try to withdraw the early profits or waste them in an effort to avoid paying taxes. The scenario in this sample business case <i class="calibre8">should be the norm </i>for early capitalization, and it is what we advise our clients to do. Unfortunately, a lot of entrepreneurs do not understand this strategy, and it leads to early failures for start-ups.</p>
<p class="noindent">Notice the ROIC in table 2.2. In the first year, the business owner got 38%, which is no different than investing $200,000 in a certificate of deposit with a 38% interest rate. You would have earned $100,000 in interest, paid 40% tax (or $40,000), and if you are like most people, you would have reinvested the profits. Technically, the rate of return is 50% ($100,000 pretax net income divided by $200,000 original capital), but table 2.2 shows the year-1 after-tax net income as part of the capital base, like a <a id="calibre_link-127" class="calibre4"></a>normal balance sheet, since you do have access to cash generated from profits during the year to help you make more profit.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you think 38% ROIC is good in year 1, it increases to more than 50% in years 2 and 3 (see table 2.2). I have studied the business profit and capital structure of hundreds of businesses. Every business that was at the proper capitalization levels and had less than 50% ROIC struggled with cash flow and sustainability. If a business is highly leveraged, the ROIC will be even higher, but it is a false sense of success since it comes from overleveraging the business, and it will suffer if credit becomes tight. The only sustainable businesses with an ROIC less than 50% are the ones that have excess cash in the business (that is, beyond two months of operating expenses).</p>
<p class="noindent">An ROIC of 50% or more is a pretty good rate of return without selling the business! A high rate of return like this puts you in an optimal position to demand a premium sale price for your business, or you can walk away.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Real-World Business Case</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Since we use a common profit and loss format (our proprietary Simple Numbers Profit Model, discussed in Chapter 5) for the clients we work with, it is easy to aggregate data so we can study trends and business outcomes in our client base. The data in table 2.3 comes from 50 companies we work with across the US from all the basic industries (manufacturing, retail, services, and technology). By using an aggregate of 50 companies, the outcome is far more compelling than data from a single business. In selecting the 50 companies, we did not pick just the winners; we chose the first 50 companies for which we had complete data during the time period we studied and who we thought we would have ongoing data from so we could continue to study economic trends.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-99" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 2.3</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Real-world case: Invested capital and returns</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00023.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The beginning invested capital in year 1 represents the equity balance to start the first year of analysis. Many of the companies in this data set had sweat equity, but that number is not shown in table 2.3.</p>
<p class="noindent">Table 2.3 presents a good waterfall view of what really happens in business:</p>

<ol class="calibre10">
<li value="1" class="calibre11">Invest capital.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre11">Make a profit.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre11">Pay tax on the Profit.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-67" class="calibre4"></a>Decide how much after-tax profit to reinvest in the business.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre11">Distribute after-tax profits that were not needed for growth.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre11">Repeat!</li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">In the group of 50 companies represented in table 2.3, the revenue growth was between 14% and 20% for three years! None of them needed outside capital for growth, and as a group they averaged 1.5 months of operating expenses in cash (all labor costs plus operating expenses). This flies in the face of the common belief that you need outside capital to grow. Not only did these companies grow without outside capital, they distributed cash profits of 27% to 29% to the investors each year. The profit distribution varies from year to year since it cannot be determined until after taxes and reinvestments.</p>
<p class="noindent">I have not mentioned anything about revenue other than the annual growth rate. Revenue is the most slippery number on your profit and loss statement. It is just the start of the math. The real key performance indicators you should focus on are ROIC and the volume of your investment. If you compound interest at a rate of 50% to 100%, it grows quite nicely, as shown in table 2.4.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of our clients who are skilled at running a business, I would say that 75% ROIC is the most common data point. For our clients who have over $5 million in revenue, the average moves closer to 90%. As you get bigger, your cost structure should get more efficient. The challenge companies face is reinvesting in the business and getting the same return. Effectively reinvesting requires two things: (a) the market must accept your product or service at the current price point; and (b) if the market demands more, you need to be able to deliver at the same, or a better, cost.</p>
<p class="imgc"><a id="calibre_link-224" class="calibre4"></a><img src="images/00013.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-68" class="calibre4"></a>When an entrepreneur says they could grow if they had access to capital, they really mean they could grow if they could use someone else’s cash who could afford to lose it if their idea does not work. They are not willing to spend their own profits and risk losing them if they are wrong about what it takes to grow. That may sound harsh, but the data suggests it is true. In our 50- company data set, the entrepreneurs took out roughly a third of their profits to do other things. As much as you might like to think they were using the funds to diversify their investments, the funds were mostly used for consumption. Also, keep in mind that all these companies are following our guidelines for market-based wages for the job they do in the business, and most of them are at the high end of the market-based wage range.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is nothing wrong with consumption, but it does speak to how entrepreneurs truly act. Any business owner who consumes profits from the business to fund their lifestyle is on a slippery road to entrepreneurial hell because there will be some years when the business will not make a profit, but the consumption will continue. The only source to fund consumption in those years is to diminish the capital base of the business or, even worse, use company debt sources to keep up distribution demands. This is the key reason why businesses fail during recessions. Our clients thrived during the previous recession, and many had their most profitable years because they were fully capitalized and could take advantage of their weakened competitors.</p>
<p class="noindent">Entrepreneurs become more risk averse as they become more successful and make enough to live on comfortably. There is a place for outside capital, and there is a place for reinvestment of profits; you need to be aware of when to use which strategy. Many entrepreneurs who raise outside capital do not focus on getting profitable quickly enough, and this leads to many avoidable start-up failures. On the other hand, you need to know how to set expectations for the returns needed on reinvestments, and you need to hold your team accountable for results.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-69" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">The Black Art of Marketing for Growth</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">I was having dinner one night with my good friend Dan Martell, and we were discussing business (as I am prone to do). A thought hit me about how simple (but not easy) it is to grow a business. I told Dan, “If you can figure out what the market needs, find a way to do it profitably, and it makes a good return on investment, all that is left is to tell everybody about it.” Since then, as I applied that thought to my clients, I have found that it encompasses the root of the challenge. Notice that it does not say anything about finding money. If I can make a profit doing whatever the market needs, money is not a problem. The growth plan will usually fund itself from profits as fast as I can grow, or I can find capital if I need an up-front investment. I have yet to see a good marketfocused growth initiative that cannot get funded.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you can find a market need, figuring out how to satisfy it profitably is the easiest part of the equation. The marketing piece is still a bit of a black art. As much as the marketing pros will try to tell you they know how to market your idea if you spend enough, I see more activity than accomplishment in many high-spend campaigns. The real challenge comes when the market becomes insensitive to what has been working, and you have to keep changing your approach. It is almost like driving 100 miles per hour at night with no headlights. The occasional streetlight gives you a glimpse of the road, but not enough to stay out of the ditch.</p>
<p class="noindent">The main challenge to growth is a poor understanding of what the market needs and an unwillingness to risk profits that you are used to consuming. As the data set from 50 companies showed, those entrepreneurs were motivated to take about a third of the profits out of their business (see table 2.3). They all had opportunities to grow their business further by adding to their geographic reach, lines of business, or deeper penetration in the markets they served.</p>

<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-118" class="calibre13"></a><b class="calibre5">Are Entrepreneurs Like Cab Drivers?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">A classic behavioral economic study looked at cab drivers in New York City. A cab driver rented their car for 12-hour shifts. When the fares were sparse, the cab driver would sit in their car hoping for fares all day. When the fares were plentiful, they quit work at 2:00 p.m. and went home early. At the time of the study, the economists identified $500 of daily earnings as the point at which they stopped being motivated to stay on shift. Could it be that most entrepreneurs quit risking their cash once they have reached their subconscious consumption goal?</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">I think this is why the second business is the hardest to start for entrepreneurs. They are usually unwilling to do for the second business what made them successful the first time. I often counsel entrepreneurs to consider this before they sell their first business. I suggest that they might consider starting the second business before they sell the first one to make sure they can repeat their success.</p>

<p class="sc"><i class="calibre8">Price is what you pay, value is what you get.</i></p>
<p class="center">&ndash; Warren Buffett</p>
<p class="noindent1a">Now that we have established a framework to understand your business from an investment standpoint, we can assess its value and implement a decision-making tool to help you decide when to sell your business, or keep it, based on the economics.</p>
<p class="noindent">The marketplace can be a cruel taskmaster when it comes to valuing your business. In my experience, the first offer that starts the selling discussion never goes any higher once the term sheet is signed, so you must get the value right before the initial negotiation. The market sees every business model differently, so it tends to overvalue sexy businesses at times.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is also important to understand the buyer’s purchasing power. If the buyer has enough cash to cover the purchase, they can pay more if they choose to. If the buyer is funding the purchase from future cash flows (a seller-held note or a bank loan), the value of the business will be limited to how much can be funded from that cash flow, which will limit the company’s growth until the note or loan is substantially paid down. Since the vast majority of buyers try to fund their purchase from future cash flows, you need to understand how that valuation works.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-100" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Economic Value</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">In my previous book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big</i> <i class="calibre8">Profits!</i>, I developed a formula to determine the economic value of a business. It blends both the profits and the capital in a business, and it has proven to be quite robust in bringing clarity to the value of a business. We have successfully used this formula for private company buy/sell agreements, stock awards, stock options, and phantom stock plans in situations when a value formula is needed instead of an appraised value.</p>
<p class="noindent">The formula was originally based on the common problem of how to buy out a 50% partner. I asked fellow entrepreneurs this question: how many years are you willing to give up all of the company’s after-tax profits to get your 50% partner out of your life? Many entrepreneurs who had never bought out a partner said two to three years. The ones who had bought out a partner said five years.</p>
<p class="noindent">Next I looked at multiple data sets to prove the math. The outcome was my valuation formula that employs a blend of profit and capital. I found that if a company is operating on a stable level of profit, you would take the last three years of pretax net income plus the equity (assets minus liabilities) at the date of the sale (see table 3.1).</p>
<p class="noindent">In table 3.1 the company is maintaining its profits around 10% and is retaining very little of the profits each year to add to equity. Since profitability is stable, it is more accurate to use the last three years as the net income period for evaluation than to use the most recent year times three. Had profitability been falling, the buyer might argue that you should take the most recent year times three, or weight the most recent year heavier than the previous two years, to establish the true value.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-101" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 3.1</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Economic value example</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00007.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Table 3.2 proves the math to buy out a 50% partner. In this scenario, the partner who is buying would have to use 100% of the after-tax profits for 51 months to complete the buyout. In most situations when I have used this calculation, the length of the payoff is from four to six years. This formula is a good starting point to help you determine if you should buy out a 50% partner when no outside cash is available.</p>

<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00015.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-219" class="calibre4"></a>Many entrepreneurs think they can accelerate the buyout or leverage it. The only business that can grow its way into an accelerated payoff is one that does not need additional working capital to grow. If the company requires growth in accounts receivable or inventory, it is very difficult to pay off a buyout faster. The only situation where I have seen a faster payoff is when the exiting partner was a barrier to growth and the company hit new highs in both profit and growth once that partner was out of the business.</p>
</div>

<div id="calibre_link-259" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-324"><b class="calibre5">Market Value</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">There is a very good reason why an outside investor may pay a market value higher than my economic value calculation. Money chases easy, while entrepreneurs overcome hard. Given the alternative investments available for money to gravitate toward, a profitable business can still yield significantly more than market investments and, if you have money, you do not have to endure the building of a business. The founder gets a nice value for the business they built, and the investor can take it to the next level and often infuse new energy and structure the business to scale it. That is the premise every buyer starts with, but it still works less than half the time. Just make sure the check clears when you sell!</p>
<p class="sca"><i class="calibre14">Money chases easy.<br class="calibre9" />Entrepreneurs overcome hard.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Since an investment in a privately held business is not easily liquid, it usually requires a higher yield to attract investment. In recent years we have started seeing higher premiums for many businesses, even at smaller revenue sizes. There is so much cash looking for a place to invest and so few businesses for sale that prices are being driven up across the board.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-104" class="calibre4"></a>When public companies are growing and the stock market is making great returns, private company valuations stay in the four to six times net income range. (There are industry outliers, like tech, that require more of a bet placed on the future than reliance on current fundamentals.) Investors tend to flock to the public market instead of driving up private company prices since public companies have ready liquidity if the owners want to get out, whereas private companies take much longer to become liquid. When the stock market is near a bubble high and interest rates are very low for fixed income investing, value multiples start to approach 7 to 10 times net income. Money has to find someplace to go. To make great yields from a private business, you need not only cash but skill, or you have to pay someone who is skilled to use your capital wisely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Table 3.3 examines the same buyout example as shown in table 3.1 but with market value calculations at 5 times, 7.5 times, and 10 times net income. You can see that it takes about five years for the five times net income buyout of the 50% partner. As you start to move up the premium scale, the buyout time gets longer and longer.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-102" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 3.3</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Example of 50% buyout</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00012.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent">In case you are thinking about selling to a key executive, the management team, or a family member, table 3.3 shows the 100% sale amortization that ranges from 10-plus years to almost 36 years. As a practical matter, you are not likely to successfully complete a 100% sale from cash flows that lasts longer than 10 years. (The Small Business Administration usually lends for only seven years for this type of debt.) Once the value gets beyond five times net income, a capital injection of outside money will be needed to make this type of sale work, except in the rarest of circumstances.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-70" class="calibre13"></a><b class="calibre5">Selling to an Insider</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">A sale to someone internally who works for you is hard to pull off with outside debt. The lender is not sure the business will continue to perform as it has, and the purchaser is not coming to the table with any money, just internal experience. If you want to get more money up front, the purchaser will have to raise some outside capital to supplement the debt used at the time of purchase.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">This is an important point for multiple shareholders to understand when crafting buy/sell agreements. The company cannot usually fund a market value buyout from cash flow when the market is paying a premium for businesses. Structuring a buy/sell agreement to have an appraisal for valuation is a trap that often causes an early sale of the whole company, rather than one partner taking over after the other partner leaves. Sometimes there are dueling appraisals, when each partner hires their own appraiser, or the partners might agree to use the same appraiser. Unless the appraiser is directed to use only a historical or forward-looking discounted cash flows approach, the partners end up with an unworkable outcome that usually blows up one to two years into the deal.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a planning philosophy, it is hard to argue that the partner who leaves early, without the total sale of the business, deserves more than the economic value. Any attempt to pay the exiting partner more than their share of the economic value usually leads to a failed payout, and nobody is happy. The remaining partner needs to keep the company healthy while using all available profits to buy out the exiting partner. In most businesses, it does not work to stress the working capital or try to grow out of the payout</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-222" class="calibre13"></a><b class="calibre5">Case Study: Sale to Employee Stock Ownership Plan</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">I worked with a client who decided they wanted to sell their business to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) instead of selling it outright. The founders had done a good job of building a management team that would take over and run the business. They wanted to sell 100% of the business to the ESOP, and they would take back notes to fund the sale.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though there are significant tax benefits that would help increase cash flow to justify a slight premium to value, the deal would still have to make sense from a cash flow perspective. The founders selected an independent appraiser to value the business, and the appraised value made them happy since it was based on market sales of similar businesses at a time when crazy speculative premiums were being paid. My task was to deliver the bad news to the founders that the deal would never go through at that price, and either their notes would be in default shortly into the deal or they would be forced to sell the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">The founders were convinced the deal would work even though it required increases in profitability and growth that the company had never seen. Needless to say, two years into the deal there was not enough cash flow to service the notes, and the company was sold to another ESOP company that had idle cash and was willing to pay close to the original price. Even though the outcome would have been worse if a new buyer had not stepped in, it did not play out the way all of the stakeholders had wanted. You cannot get maximum value and sell to someone who does not have the cash or the financing ability to pay full price.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-161" class="calibre4"></a>because there is no money to operate with after closing. The only businesses that grow out of this arrangement are the rare ones that require very little increase in working capital to grow.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Why Would Someone Pay a Premium?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">When you compare the dollar figures for economic value and market value, you start to rethink that quaint idea of selling to a key employee or a family member for just the cash flow value. This is the biggest reason why family businesses have become rare&mdash;not because of social reasons. The market to buy and sell businesses is much more sophisticated than ever before, and it extends much more effectively into businesses valued at less than $5 million than it did prior to the dot-com era in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="noindent">As I said in the return on invested capital (ROIC) discussion, when the ROIC potential is high, the market finds a way to capitalize on it when there is plenty of cash to risk. To prove my point, let’s look at the example in table 3.4.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-244" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-325"><b class="calibre5">Table 3.4</b></h2>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Business case to pay 10 times net income for an acquisition</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00040.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-162" class="calibre4"></a>Assume the following:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">The company purchase price of 10 times net income includes any capitalization the company needs to meet their working capital stability standards.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Every $10 million in revenue growth will require $700,000 of additional capital.</li>
<li class="calibre11">There is no change in profitability as the company continues to grow.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">At the time of purchase, the ROIC is only 10%, which is not very exciting and is not enticing enough to accept as an outcome. The main reason someone would pay 10 times net income is they think they can grow the business better (and potentially more profitably) than the founder. You start to see why they bought the business when they get to stage 1 because they double the original business and get the ROIC up to 19%. To be fair, in table 3.4 I added more capital for each stage of growth. The time frame between each stage will determine if the additional capital will need to come from an outside source or if it can be funded from profits.</p>
<p class="noindent">At stage 2 you see the real reason why the purchaser bought the company: the ROIC increased to 33%. Keep in mind that ROIC is the year-over-year returns and does not include the terminal value of the company in a sale scenario. In the past, almost all companies that were funded from the outside looked for an exit within a 10-year horizon, but there is starting to be a shift, and owners are looking to hold their companies for the long term. As funds look for ways to give investors a return on their money, it is now making more sense to hold on to a business longer, even beyond the 10-year horizon.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consider the US public stock markets since the 2008 crash. The markets have become quite stale since then. Very few companies <a id="calibre_link-105" class="calibre4"></a>have gone public, and quite a few have gone back to private. Recall that in table 2.3, which reflects data from 50 private companies, the company growth rate is 14% to 20%, whereas the overall economy is growing from 2% to 4%. It is no wonder the smart money is trying to figure out new ways to invest in private companies (without going public) instead of just flipping them. I expect the private equity market to keep thriving in the current market conditions. Their task is to bring C-suite talent to all the companies in their portfolio at a far greater value than if each company had that talent on its own. That strategy is also more attractive to the executive in each functional area because they will be in charge of a much larger and more robust business.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-326"><b class="calibre5">Other Valuation Methods</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and you will hear many different ideas of how to determine the value of a business. Even businesses that are not profitable can be quite valuable in certain circumstances. Here are a few other methods to look at when considering value.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-327"><b class="calibre5">Strip Sale</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">This is the most common valuation method for small business transactions when one company buys another company. The buyer needs the company’s operating activity but does not need its overhead, thus the term “strip sale” since they strip out the company’s activity and bolt it on to their existing business. This is almost always done as an asset sale, with the seller responsible for paying off debts and vendors and clearing any liens on assets that were sold. For a business that is struggling, this is a good opportunity to hit the reset button and go in a different direction, and it often leads to a better valuation than trying to find someone to buy the business as is. As they say, sometimes the parts are worth more than the whole.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-150" class="calibre4"></a>A strip sale approach was used when a buyer bought my client’s business for $2 million while it was losing money. The buyer needed the company’s highly skilled labor, and it would have cost them at least that much to build a comparable team. Plus the buyer had more projects than my client did, and those projects were worth more, so assigning that work to a ready-made team would make them profitable from the first day.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-262" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-328"><b class="calibre5">Thorn in the Side</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Sometimes a business is a pain to its competitors, and the competitors want that business to go away because its new mousetrap is better. If they cannot compete with the better mousetrap, they might pay a king’s ransom to make the business go away. This is not uncommon in disruptive industries when the new kid on the block starts to gain market share and the buyer would have to cannibalize their existing margins to compete. It is better to buy them quick before they get too big. I have seen companies get 10 times their <i class="calibre8">revenue </i>just to go away.</p>
<p class="scl"><b class="calibre5">Software as a Service and Recurring Revenue</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Software as a service (SaaS) companies and other companies with a strong recurring revenue model are the darlings of the premium business value marketplace. Despite the glory, beware of the traps. I will cover this in more detail in Chapter 6 when I discuss reinvesting in your business concepts. The common belief is to throw all your profits (and possibly outside capital) at growing this type of business as fast as you can. I agree with the idea of rapid growth, but only if you know what actually works to grow your business.</p>
<p class="noindent">I have clients who continually invest in advancing their software (when is a developer ever done with the software?) and spend considerable sums for marketing. Both are noble activities, but more discipline is needed to spend money where it works, not to spend just because you think that is what you are supposed to do.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-151" class="calibre4"></a>When possible, I like the controlled experiment process for both software development and marketing. You spend a small amount to prove your concept before you throw a lot of money at it to see if it sticks. It is not a sin to be profitable and have an SaaS or recurring-revenue business.</p>
<p class="noindent">These types of companies like to talk about the lifetime value of a customer. Although it is a nice argument in theory, the ability to measure this value going forward is a shot in the dark. I have heard some pretty lame arguments by marketing directors who like to use this thinking to justify their budget at a higher and higher customer acquisition cost. As a case in point, Google dynamically increases the price of your key search term as you add content that drives demand for it; in essence, they make you bid against your own success.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to build your business on recurring revenue or add recurring revenue to your existing business model, focus on market needs that truly fit that model with long-term customers. Trying to force a traditional business activity into a recurring revenue model just to get a higher multiple for a sale does not work if it makes you less profitable on an ongoing basis.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-329"><b class="calibre5">Replacement Return Decision Process</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">When an offer is pending for you to sell your business, it is very difficult to know if you are getting a good deal. The question is not so much about market value, but rather if you should sell now or wait for another time. If you are ready to sell, try to get multiple competitive offers, conjure up any strategic value idea you can muster, scrub any discretionary expenses from the books, and hope for the best. If your company is in its prime and doing well, look at the replacement return you need to get&mdash;the aftertax proceeds from the sale to replace your pretax profit so you maintain the same net income.</p>
<p class="noindent">Selling a business is emotional. For as much as the money sounds good, you are selling your creation. One of the toughest entrepreneurs I know told me that the first weekend after he sold his business, he cried like a baby and second-guessed himself, even though he got a life-changing amount of money. That really hit me.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-153" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Replacement Return Case Study</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Going back to the behavioral economics concept, I needed a way to help my clients frame their thinking for the potentially lifechanging decision to sell their business. An idea came to me when a client called to discuss the potential sale of his business. His capital advisors had brought multiple offers at seven times net income to the table. The advisors (who stood to make $1.5 million in fees at this price) were telling him the offers were a good deal at a premium price, and they advised him to sell. I told him that even though the offers were indeed at a premium, they were still not enough. In a moment of inspiration, I did the math to help him think through the decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">He had a great business in a growing market, and his top-notch management team allowed him to work 15 hours per week in a strategic role, not an operational one. Plus he was drawing a generous market-driven CEO salary that allowed him to live comfortably. If he were to sell the business for seven times net income and pay taxes at the capital gain rate, he would have to get a replacement return of 18% to break even (the company’s current net income divided by after-tax proceeds from the sale). I explained that instead of selling now, he could keep the business, harvest the profits for a few more years, continue the company’s current growth rate, then sell the company for more. I said that even though there would be a risk that something in the future could change, a sale at seven times net income was not enough, given that the company was profitable and fully capitalized. I left the decision up to him with a cautionary note that the math said he could do better.</p>
<p class="noindent">He called me back in a week and said he got the offer up to 10 times net income, which brought the replacement return to about 10%. I gave him the green light to proceed with the sale. The change from 7 times to 10 times net income was life-changing money.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-154" class="calibre4"></a>Helping this client make such a pivotal decision was one of the most rewarding moments in my career. Although I did not get a percentage of the increase, I learned a far more valuable lesson: the strongest tool to increase the price is the power to say no and not be hurt if the sale falls through.</p>
</div>

<div id="calibre_link-265" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-330"><b class="calibre5">Replacement Return by the Numbers</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">To drive home this critical concept, let’s look at numbers from three different value points: 5 times, 7 times, and 10 times net income (table 4.1).</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-266" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 title="**Table 4.1**, Replacement return example" class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-331"><b class="calibre5">Table 4.1</b></h2>
<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">Replacement return example</h3>

<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00028.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-146" class="calibre4"></a>Even though the return on invested capital (ROIC) is 67% in each column, you must consider the current value of the company, net of taxes, to calculate the replacement return. Emotional reasons to sell a business include retirement, fear about the future market, or the desire to sell to family or key employees. But from an economic point of view, you would need to get a replacement return between 13% and 27% at the three value points shown in table 4.1.</p>
<p class="noindent">I find that most entrepreneurs are reluctant to invest in the stock market and generally turn to real estate for alternative investments. My real estate clients indicate (and my own data confirms) that the expected yield for a real estate portfolio is between 8% and 15%, not considering unusual spikes in market values for property sales or lack of liquidity in down markets with tighter financing rules.</p>
<p class="noindent">Using replacement return to guide your thinking, if you have a sale offer for five times net income, you should sell only if you have another business idea for reinvesting the after-tax proceeds. Since a good business can yield 50% ROIC or more, reinvestment in another business is the only economic reason to sell at this price.</p>
<p class="noindent">A sale offer for seven times net income is beyond the high end of real estate returns, and you should sell only to reinvest in a better business or for emotional reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent">An economic green light occurs only when the replacement return is anywhere below 15%. You would pass on an offer at this level only if there are still significant growth opportunities for your business. A good time to exit is when you foresee more risk or effort to take advantage of those opportunities, typically when you need to expand your geographic reach and you would be forced to travel and be away from family, which is always a tough trade-off.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-155" class="calibre4"></a>When you start a business or reinvest for growth, use ROIC for decision making. When you consider selling a business, use replacement return to gain economic clarity. Since I developed this concept to help my clients think through keep-versus-sell decisions, it has helped them postpone sales discussions unless they can get a replacement return below 15%. It also helps them see their business more as an investment and lets them focus on enhancing profit and making their capital more efficient; these are the levers of ROIC, as we will see in Chapter 5.</p>

<p class="noindent1a">Every Entrepreneur struggles to understand the dynamic relationship between profit and cash flow. Accountants have a report they refer to as a cash flow statement, but it is largely unreadable, even by accountants! Many entrepreneurs just print out a cash basis P&amp;L, which can work for small businesses that carry very little in accounts receivable or inventory. The missing purpose of why you need to keep your books on the accrual basis and monitor the balance sheet is to monitor profitability, and to have an understanding of how much capital it took for you to generate that profit&mdash;and when is it likely to turn into cash. If you gravitate to looking at cash basis reports, you do not understand the <i class="calibre8">trade capital </i>(a term I will define in the next chapter) that you had to fund to keep the business growing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Normally, during a consulting session, I would have the entrepreneur pull out their balance sheet and try to educate them on how the balance sheet moves as the business goes through seasonal cycles and growth. However, I have realized that the original design of the balance sheet was meant for the account-ants and not for understanding capital formation needs of the business. As I go through the explanation of proper capital needs for each business model, my goal is that you will come away with a better understanding of the four types of capital each business needs and what the capital signature of your model is, along with a way to measure capital efficiency and sufficiency.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-206" class="calibre4"></a>I will break traditional accounting thinking by netting certain assets and liabilities rather than using the traditional accounting presentation of “assets on the left and liabilities on the right.” Who came up with that anyway? The correct way of thinking is to connect the functional assets with their respective liabilities and look at them net of each other.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are an entrepreneur, I think you will find my approach intriguing, if not refreshing and insightful. If you are an accountant by training, you will likely struggle with it; but just remember that if our purpose is to help entrepreneurs better understand their business, you might want to take your cue from the entrepreneur and give this idea a shot!</p>

<p class="sc"><i class="calibre8">You have to learn </i>why <i class="calibre8">things work on a starship.</i></p>
<p class="center">&ndash; Captain James T. Kirk (<i class="calibre8">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</i>)</p>
<p class="noindent1a">As the CEO of your business, you can surround yourself with technical expertise in sales, marketing, operations, and finance, but you need to know <i class="calibre8">why </i>and <i class="calibre8">how </i>they all fit together. You will need a technical or intuitive understanding of profit and capital for each activity in your business.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you simplify all the business models in the world, they come down to three activities: manufacturing (make stuff), sales and distribution (sell stuff), or providing services (do stuff). You may do one, two, or all three of these activities, but each employs a distinct profit and capital model within the same business. However, if you want to scale your business, you should focus on the one thing you do best.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are great at manufacturing but fall short in sales, you should partner with a sales organization. You might be great at selling stuff but not world class at making it, so contract with a manufacturer that can do it better for a lower price. It is not <a id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre4"></a>uncommon for technology sales businesses to expand into providing services and fail miserably. They forget to account for service employee downtime that is not billable, and they struggle to interpret fluctuations from project to project because they are not selling tangible items with a consistent margin, as in the sales side of their business. They quickly learn that they need a lot more people in services to generate the same margin as one salesperson. And they struggle with the service value of each employee&mdash;a variable human component that does not exist in hardware.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once I started to categorize all my clients and their business segments into these three categories&mdash;make stuff, sell stuff, or do stuff&mdash;I saw an amazingly consistent set of metrics across all businesses of each type. These metrics help businesses with multiple types of activities understand where they make the most profit so they do not sacrifice their success in the pursuit of an activity they are ill-suited for, or in which they would have to sink money into fixing things.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Comparison of Make Stuff, Sell Stuff, and Do Stuff Models</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Let’s start our comparison of the three business models from a familiar point of reference: profit and loss (as shown in table 5.1).</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-300" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-332"><b class="calibre5">Table 5.1</b></h2>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Profit and loss comparison for businesses that make stuff, sell stuff, and do stuff</span></i></p>
<p class="text1"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">* dLER is direct labor efficiency ratio. mLER is management labor efficiency ratio. See Chapter 8 for a detailed discussion on LER.</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><a id="calibre_link-28" class="calibre4"></a><img src="images/00009.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-29" class="calibre4"></a>The first thing to notice is the wide variation of gross margin. This is a prime example of why revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, and cash is king!</p>
<p class="noindent">There is also a wide variation in the contribution margin as percentage to sales and the direct labor efficiency ratio (dLER). The management labor efficiency ratio (mLER) is a little tighter, but it still varies a lot. Net income as percentage to sales varies widely, but notice that two out of three columns are essentially equal to net income as percentage to gross margin. That is still not a universal indicator, but it is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s dive into each example.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-23" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-333"><b class="calibre5">Make Stuff</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">The company in the “Make Stuff” column of table 5.1 is ultimately a $2.6 million manufacturing business. When you think about it, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is just a passthrough. If a customer wanted to use all their manufacturing capacity and said they would buy all the materials and supplies for everything the company makes, and if they asked the company for a manufacturing services quote, the price should be $2.6 million (all things being equal).</p>
<p class="noindent">The company might quote a lower price because the customer would be taking all the risk on materials and supplies, but I would encourage them not to do that since none of their operating costs would change. What does change is the amount of inventory they would need to carry. They might be able to lower the price some, depending on how much less capital they need to deploy. But hold that thought; we will evaluate it when we look at the Sell Stuff model.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-17" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-334"><b class="calibre5">Sell Stuff</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">The “Sell Stuff” example in table 5.1 is based on a distributor model. At first glance, you wonder how the company survives <a id="calibre_link-205" class="calibre4"></a>on a 13% gross margin; but you can see that of the three businesses in table 5.1, they have the highest net income as percentage to gross margin at 23.21%. Once again, the harsh reality is that this business owner does not have a $40 million business. It is a $5.35 million inventory management company. To work on a margin this thin, they have invested in the best inventory management systems, processes, and automated handling capabilities. They are world class in their ability to execute a repetitive process because there is not enough margin for error&mdash;literally!</p>
<p class="noindent">I often tell my clients who sell stuff that the accounting process for inventory is theoretically very simple, but less than 5% of businesses who have inventory are good at it. Most businesses get close, true up the difference once a year (quarterly at best), and slug an unknown variance that no one can explain into COGS. Does that sound familiar to anyone?</p>
<p class="noindent">You could break down a Selling Stuff model into two segments: businesses that never handle inventory (or only what has already been sold so they can fulfill orders), and businesses that carry stock with no specific customer to buy it. From a capital perspective, if you stock your items, you carry more inventory and typically get paid at sale or carry lower accounts receivable. If you sell items that other companies fulfill, you will typically have higher accounts receivable waiting to get paid, which trades off the carrying cost of inventory. The worst capital structure is when a business gives corporate terms of 30-plus days on accounts receivable and also carries inventory. In that case, the business needs a really high profit margin to be viable because of the capital signature.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-18" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-335"><b class="calibre5">Do Stuff</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">While the “Do Stuff” business in table 5.1 has a nice profit in dollars, it is the hardest to scale because there is very little COGS <a id="calibre_link-30" class="calibre4"></a>pass-through; it includes only subcontractors and materials. In this case, a subcontractor is a person or a company that performs a portion of the service at a rate of 130% of, or more than, what you would pay one of your employees to do the work. If you have freelancers or use a staffing company to provide direct labor, they should be shown as direct labor. Once the rate charged by a subcontractor exceeds 130%, you are essentially leaving enough margin in what you are paying to require some management oversight, and those costs should be accounted for as a passthrough in COGS.</p>
<p class="noindent">A services business generally has to get significantly more gross margin (and revenue!) to match the net income as percentage to gross margin of the other business types. Operating expenses as percentage to sales tends to be significantly higher than the other models. All of this leads to an underwhelming net income as percentage to gross margin, as compared to the other two business types. I have some services clients that can get to 20% or higher net income as percentage to sales, but they struggle to maintain it, and they struggle even more to scale it. There are only so many customers who will pay the kind of prices that produce that much profit.</p>
<p class="noindent">The thing you need to know is which of these business models you would rather have. What defining question does the data need to answer?</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-19" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-336"><b class="calibre5">The Defining Question</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">The typical entrepreneur is profit-and-loss myopic. They look at gross margin, they look at how much labor they have to manage, they look at net profit, but they rarely look at the balance sheet. They speak of cash flow, but that is just the change in the balance sheet items, and it does not encompass everything they need to know.</p>
<p class="sca"><a id="calibre_link-163" class="calibre7"></a><i class="calibre14">The defining question:<br class="calibre9" />what is the ROIC for each business model?</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The real question you need to ask of the data is this: what is the return on invested capital (ROIC) for each business model? Before you can answer that question, you need to understand the four types of capital.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-298" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-337"><b class="calibre5">Four Types of Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Every business model has a capital signature that is influenced by the type of capital required to run that model. They have common characteristics, which explains why one business with gross margin of 13% can thrive while another business fails at that same percentage. A business can have 20% net income and go broke without outside investment to support it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at the four types of capital:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Trade capital</li>
<li class="calibre11">Infrastructure capital</li>
<li class="calibre11">Buffer capital</li>
<li class="calibre11">Launch capital</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-22" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-338"><b class="calibre5">Trade Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">The term <i class="calibre8">working capital </i>has always bothered me. It is taught in accounting school, and bankers have faithfully beat up their borrowing customers with that metric for years. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. It seems simple enough, but it tells an incomplete truth. Working capital contains two items: cash on the asset side, and line of credit on the debit side. I choose how much cash I keep in the business and how much I decide to put in or take out. I choose whether to borrow funds from the bank or put my own cash in to support accounts receivable and inventory.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-171" class="calibre4"></a>Because my firm models every business we work with, I started looking into this deeper and realized there was a clear subcomponent of working capital lurking below the surface. Trade capital is working capital with cash and line of credit (all short term debt) stripped out. It is the net of accounts receivable, inventory, and work in progress, less accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue. The resulting number tells you how much recurring income you will have at this volume of sales. Unless you act to change terms with vendors and customers, trade capital will remain constant in your model, and we use it to predict cash flow from operations rather than needing to predict each individual line of trade capital for forecasting.</p>
<p class="noindent">It was eye opening to discover that the easiest way to predict operating cash flow is not the action of the individual trade capital components, but the harmony of how they interact; and I only need to look at the net number. By looking at the net number, it also helps my strategy decisions. For example, I can worry about inventory levels, but when my vendors give me good enough terms that I have no real net cost of carry, why would I ever risk being out of stock?</p>
<p class="noindent">This is the weakness of the traditional balance sheet presentation. If I were to redesign it, I would net the elements of trade capital in one group, instead of putting assets on the left and liabilities on the right. For all our clients, we add this net number in our balance sheet presentation, then we show trade capital as a percentage of rolling 12 revenue. The power of this calculation is amazingly simple:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-172" class="calibre4"></a>If your trade capital percentage to revenue is lower than your net income percentage to revenue, you are in the cash-free growth zone. You can accept growth and not burn cash, as long as net income percentage is higher than trade capital percentage.</li>
<li class="calibre11">If your trade capital percentage to revenue is higher than your net income percentage to revenue, you have to use the base camp growth method. To grow, you will burn cash to invest in accounts receivable or inventory; you can grow only as far as your cash and debt resources allow. Then you pause for a time to let the cash flow catch up, and you let it build it for another growth run to the next base camp.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">This is why some companies have linear growth and others have a growth spurt, flatten out, and have a growth spurt again.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-180" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-339"><b class="calibre5">Infrastructure Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Infrastructure capital is easy to understand because it is the cost of your fixed and intangible assets net of the debt that supports particular assets, which normally include equipment, furniture, and building and leasehold improvements. It also includes intangible assets in a business purchase of goodwill items.</p>
<p class="noindent">In this case, the proper utilization of debt can make a huge difference in the return on investment. In a typical scenario, the bank wants you to put about 20% down on real estate and somewhere between 0% and 20% for leasehold improvements and equipment, depending on your credit history. We accountants make this a lot harder than it needs to be, as I describe in the following real-life scenario.</p>
<p class="noindent">Suppose you go to the car dealership and buy a truck for your business that costs $50,000. To get the best financing rate, you pay $5,000 down and drive away with the truck. Your accountant asks you what the $5,000 purchase was for that is booked to fixed assets, and you tell them about the truck purchase. This sets off a series of accounting adjustments:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-159" class="calibre4"></a>Fixed assets are debited for $45,000 to get the full asset value, and $45,000 is credited to book the note payable.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Each payment on the note is recorded. A credit is booked to the expense account where the note payment was recorded until the accountant found out about it, a debit is booked for the principal portion, and a debit is booked for the interest portion.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Depreciation is booked, which should be done monthly but is usually done once per year. Most businesses book it as tax depreciation instead of true book depreciation over the useful life of the asset.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">You can see why entrepreneurs hate accounting and easily get confused. If you book the down payment to an expense account called truck expense, and you book each note payment to truck expense, you would end up with <i class="calibre8">exactly </i>the same outcome over the life of the asset with a third of the accounting entries (this is essentially equivalent to the old rules of booking an operating lease). Certainly, this would be a violation of generally accepted accounting principles, but it would be closer to economic truth and easier to read and understand. If you had to send the bank a financial statement, you would note the departure of accounting process and let them know the current balances on the equipment notes. The bank already ignores the book value of fixed assets and looks at the market value for your equipment.</p>
<p class="noindent">I do not expect my thinking to become the standard of accounting presentation, but it is necessary for entrepreneurs to grasp ROIC concepts. Here is a real-life story to illustrate the point.</p>
<p class="noindent">A retail store client visited our office for a planning day. For their first five stores, they paid for the buildouts with their own funds to the tune of $200,000 to $300,000 each. We applied the ROIC <a id="calibre_link-31" class="calibre4"></a>principle of 50% return standard, and they were just above it. When I modeled the potential return for the sixth store, I had them finance the buildout and treat the payment effectively as rent. As a result, the ROIC potential on that store shot up to 200%! Essentially, financing the buildout and converting it to an operating expense removed a huge barrier to scaling and provided an incredible ROIC. I told the client to be mindful that if the store fails, they will still have to pay the debt, but they will also have to pay the rent for the term of the lease. There is economically no difference, so it can be accounted for in the same way if you are looking for economic reality instead of traditional accounting presentation.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-236" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-340"><b class="calibre5">Buffer Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">In my first book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!</i>, I established a cash standard for all businesses. It says that cash should always be equal to two months of operating expenses and zero drawn on a line of credit. Essentially, any expense you do not get terms on would be part of this calculation (all labor and operating expenses). The way I arrived at this was to research four years of client data and look for the deepest negative cash flow cycle in any given month. For a normally operating business, I never saw a dip greater than two months of operating expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent">As we started sharing this metric and driving our clients to use it, we realized the best part was that entrepreneurs could easily see how much cash is enough and how much cash is too much. It clearly defined what it looks like to be fully capitalized. I am fine with debt, and I even encourage it when it matches the true useful life of a productive asset like buildings and equipment. But the perpetual financing of trade capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory, put severe constraints on a well-functioning business.</p>
<p class="noindent">My approach was proven in 2008. The media was full of reports about lines of credit being pulled from businesses, but my clients <a id="calibre_link-221" class="calibre4"></a>were not concerned. Instead, they asked me how to protect their cash in such a crazy market. I then realized they had been listening. In the three years that followed, while everyone was complaining about a recession, my clients enjoyed some of their most profitable years because they had cash and, therefore, market power. Because of the recession, their growth was limited to taking over competitors’ accounts, but they fared better than those who went out of business because of being overleveraged.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-341"><b class="calibre5">Debt Roulette</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">In his book <i class="calibre8">Fooled by Randomness</i>, Nassim Nicholas Taleb says that trusting the market is like playing Russian roulette for $100,000 per pull. You might get lucky and get ahead by $1 million, but eventually you die. This is how debt goes bad. You go to the well once too often, and that final push takes you down.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Over my years of monitoring the cash standard, I have seen a few businesses struggle to maintain two months of cash and meet the ROIC standard. Staffing companies are a great example. We have several clients in this industry, and many have to rely on factoring invoices to manage cash flow. However, one client faced the challenge by asking for, and receiving, up-front payments. Sometimes you just have to ask! Some markets will not allow this, but be creative. Bill quickly, bill often, and if you can get either a deposit or a retainer, you will significantly lower your capital requirement and boost your ROIC.</p>

<div id="calibre_link-267" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-342"><b class="calibre5">Launch Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">I refer to launch capital as the magic pixie dust for scaling business. The magic comes from its elusiveness, buried in your financial data, and only entrepreneurial wizards who have a gut <a id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre4"></a>for business know how to use it. My mission is to level the playing field for all entrepreneurs, so here is how to become a wizard.</p>
<p class="noindent">Simply speaking, launch capital is the operating losses you incur before a business activity becomes profitable. It is most easy to understand at initial launch, but it continues throughout the life of your business as you scale or respond to new competitive pressures of the market. This chapter discusses capital for initial launch, and Chapter 6 is all about launch capital during a growth phase.</p>
<p class="noindent">When I gave a speech to a group of entrepreneurs, a successful business owner whom I will call Bob was in attendance. I did not know his numbers, but I had been told he was a great businessman who had 15 auto service stores, and he was a good mentor to the group. Bob consented to let me use him as an example of the ROIC concept and let me see how good my guesses were!</p>
<p class="noindent">I said, “Bob, my guess is that it will cost you about $1 million for the dirt and the metal building to put up a new store.” He agreed, and I continued: “The bank will finance 80%, so you will need $200,000 of your own money to put down.” He agreed again. “Once the building is complete, you will have about $200,000 of opening costs and operating losses to cover until the store breaks even.” Bob paused, smiled, and said, “Yep, that is exactly what we budget.” I continued with the final piece: “Your go/no go decision for this location will be based on whether you think there is enough traffic to get this store to produce at $200,000 net profit run rate within 12 to 24 months. It will take you the first 12 months to get going, but you should get to at least $200,000, an average of $16,666 per month, by the twelfth month or sooner, but no later than 24 months.” After I finished, Bob gave me one of the best compliments I have ever received: “What you just told me in two minutes took me 20 years to figure out!” Bob is a business wizard. He does not need accountants to tell him how to run a business; they only need to handle his <a id="calibre_link-64" class="calibre4"></a>compliance work and provide data to other people because he knows his numbers in his gut. I hope these concepts help passionate entrepreneurs who do not have a gut for numbers build successful businesses.</p>
<p class="noindent">The two parts that entrepreneurs miss are correctly calculating the launch capital needed for start-up costs and the operating losses they need to cover until they break even. The operating losses require capital, just like buildings and equipment; but they are accounted for on the profit and loss statement, not on the balance sheet. To effectively see this requires a nonstandard presentation of financials to first predict the losses, then to measure your return for making that investment. It is also easy for entrepreneurs to predict the best-case scenario and not be prepared for the worst case.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Case Study: The Importance of High Return with High Risk</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Several years ago we had a client who needed to open new offices in other cities to grow their respiratory care business. We correctly estimated that they would have $150,000 of launch capital invested before the location would break even. They launched the first location and were about $60,000 into it when they realized the political alignments of the needed referral sources were not likely to make this location a success. They abandoned the office and got out of their lease. (Fortunately, they negotiated a reasonable up-front penalty in case they needed to leave.)</p>
<p class="noindent">They picked the next city and tried again. The same issues came up when they were about $75,000 into it, and once again they pulled out. The third location worked out. The <a id="calibre_link-220" class="calibre15"></a>new office was profitable well before the $150,000 was spent. That location produced over $750,000 of profit annually for several years, making it a great return on investment even if you include the two misses.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is what business is all about. You may realize by now that growing a business is really running a legal gambling enterprise! You need a high return because the risk of failure is real. If you take the return potential out of business (including higher taxes), failures increase and investors look for other places to put their money and effort. Learn to make good bets and cut losses quickly to save your cash for another try.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-343"><b class="calibre5">Capital Signature</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Now that we have an understanding of the four types of capital, and before we dive into launch capital for the growth phase of a business in Chapter 6, let’s look at the capital signatures for businesses that make stuff, sell stuff, and do stuff. Table 5.2 shows this breakdown and is a continuation of table 5.1, where we looked at the profit and loss for each business type.</p>

<div id="calibre_link-269" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-344"><b class="calibre5">Make Stuff Capital Signature</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">In the Make Stuff model in table 5.2, you can see that trade capital includes accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable. This model works for cash flow because vendors are willing to carry terms on inventory, so the company does not have to pay for inventory until it is used. Many manufacturing companies also have work in progress if the item they make has stages to its completion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Notice that the trade capital percentage to revenue is 12.30% and the profit percentage to revenue is 13.30%. This means the company essentially breaks even for cash flow on growth. If they decide to accept a lower percentage of profit to grow, say 10%, <a id="calibre_link-164" class="calibre4"></a>they would grow in a cash-negative cycle that would limit their growth potential. The only thing they could do then would be to use the base camp approach to growth that I described earlier&mdash; use only their existing cash plus line of credit, wait for their cash to catch up and build, then grow again.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-345"><b class="calibre5">Sell Stuff Capital Signature</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">The Sell Stuff model in table 5.2 represents a distributor, and they carry inventory and receivables. They run a tight ship on collections and inventory turnover, so their vendors fund almost all of their receivables and inventory. You can see that they are slightly better on trade capital percentage to revenue and net income percentage to revenue. This means that, for now, they can grow their profit and cash equally, but they cannot let any trade capital components go negative on them or it collapses quickly. When the percentages are very small, it requires even closer monitoring than normal to not let it flip and go cash negative.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some distribution companies only sell products and never take possession of the items they sold. In many of those cases, their profit margin is very low and they have to give longer terms, which often negates the benefit of not carrying inventory. I can still see this as a better play if a company is not good at building a team of people to effectively manage inventory. In table 5.2 you can see that they have a significantly higher infrastructure capital number than the other two models because of their inventory management equipment and software investment, such as bar coding and radio-frequency identification (RFID) capability.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-346"><b class="calibre5">Do Stuff Capital Signature</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Instead table 5.2 you can see why businesses that do stuff struggle with ROIC. If this services business did not have deferred revenue, their ROIC would be close to 33%. Based on public markets, that would be okay, but it underperforms all other models and explains why service firms break up easily and often <a id="calibre_link-193" class="calibre4"></a>fail to scale. They do not have an understanding of their capital requirement or the discipline to meet a capital goal, even if they have one. Many professional services firms we work with have a hard time breaking away from the old model of stripping all their cash out each year and living on their line of credit until they pay it back. To expose the weakness in this approach, all it takes is one year where the balance on the line of credit does not go down and there is no cash. Their highest-performing employees end up leaving, and they are left with only their weakest performers.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is one model where I can see a one-month core capital number if a company has a strong recurring client billing. But if the billing can be random and lumpy, they should commit to the two-months rule.</p>
<p class="noindent">The company in table 5.2 is in a cash-free growth zone due to the deferred revenue. Once again, if the deferred revenue ever goes away, their trade capital would jump to roughly $1.5 million with the same profit of roughly $1 million (their trade capital percentage to revenue would be 15%), and they would run out of cash while they are waiting to get paid. Instead of growing quickly, they would need to use the base camp approach to growth.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">CPR: Cash Power Ratio</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">To drive home the picture of the cash-free growth zone, we created the Cash Power Ratio (CPR) in Figure 5.1.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-348"><b class="calibre5">Growth with Outside Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">If your trade capital percentage to revenue is greater than your profit percentage to revenue, you can look for outside capital to help. The problem is that private equity firms are usually not interested unless they can deploy large amounts of investment with very predictable returns. They seem intrigued at first, especially if you utter the words “recurring revenue,” but they get nervous if you continue to chew through cash as you grow. In some cases an investor can take a recurring revenue stream and make a fixed yield on it, but those opportunities are hard to come by unless the revenue stream is a strong contract.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-72" class="calibre4"></a>Outside investors seem to be interested in funding launch capital spending to move the needle on your sales and bring it up to speed, where it requires less catalytic spending to keep the momentum going. If an investor is going to spin the roulette wheel of growth, it had better have a big upside&mdash;or at least your story should sell that idea!</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-349"><b class="calibre5">The Defining Question Revisited</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Earlier in this chapter we formed a defining question: what is the ROIC for each business model? We can see in table 5.2 that the Make Stuff, Sell Stuff, and Do Stuff models have a similar ROIC, but the Sell Stuff (distribution) model wins by a nose! However, the Make Stuff (manufacturing) model has the least amount of volatility if any of the trade capital items shift toward the negative (such as if customers take longer to pay or vendors require payment sooner). And, as we saw in the discussion of capital signature for a services business, the Do Stuff (services) model comes in last in ROIC.</p>
<p class="noindent">Does this mean that the Sell Stuff model is the winner? On paper, the answer is yes. But, like most things in life, it depends. Regardless of which type of business you have, a solid understanding of three business models, the types of capital, and your capital signature will help you succeed and make your model best in class.</p>

<p class="sc"><i class="calibre8">Entrepreneurs trying to grow their business<br class="calibre9" />are really running a legal gambling<br class="calibre9" />establishment! Improve your odds<br class="calibre9" />to grow smartly to beat the house!</i></p>
<p class="center">&ndash; Greg Crabtree</p>
<p class="noindent1a">It is easy to understand the story I told in Chapter 5 about launch capital for Bob’s next store. As I continued to study business models and conduct analysis calls with clients, it became clear that we were always making adjustments for special spending to explain why profit was down. Every entrepreneur likes to experiment. They hear what someone else did and want to give it a try&mdash; a new form of marketing, a new key executive who promises to be the missing link to sales, a high-priced consultant with the right elixir to cure all your ailments.</p>
<p class="noindent">All those things can be either productive or destructive, but you need to establish an outcome expectation like we did for Bob’s next store. Once you have a framework for setting the expectation, you can evaluate the new spending with a clearer mind. You will not be able to predict the outcome, but you will be able to hold the experiment accountable, like my respiratory client did when he jettisoned bad locations to save precious capital (see Chapter 5).</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-198" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Causation versus Correlation in Spending and Growth</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">The idea of setting expectations for special spending began to gel when I was working with a software company. They were fortunate enough to have a customer-funded business model like John Mullins talks about in his book <i class="calibre8">The Customer-Funded Business </i>(which I highly recommend). Since this company often collected one to three years of annual subscriptions up front, they never had to search for cash to grow the business. What they had to search for was the catalytic spend that would accelerate growth.</p>
<p class="sca"><i class="calibre14">A catalytic spend is when you bet that<br class="calibre9" />an expenditure will fuel growth.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">When a software company is built to sell from its inception, growth experts question the company’s motive to be profitable. They say the company’s goal should be to spend every cent of their available cash to grow. I am all for that idea if you know the <i class="calibre8">causation </i>effect of spending on growth. But when you know only the <i class="calibre8">correlation </i>of spending and growth, you can become wasteful in your spending strategies to spur growth. Did you grow because of your spending, or in spite of it?</p>
<p class="noindent">Each year my software client diligently planned for their growth spending, and we plotted the potential increase in the business value if the results turned out as predicted. For a fourto five-year period they risked annually between $500,000 and $1 million on growth initiatives (sales, marketing, and technology development), and I asked them to evaluate how the spending impacted sales. Each year they admitted that there was little to no effect. The company was indeed growing, but that growth was organic and resulted mostly from the strong market position of their product in their particular niche.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre4"></a>I think the company could have saved and distributed about $4 million if they had not wasted so much on growth initiatives, but the company sold for a very nice number and you do not have to feel sorry for them. Their annual planning exercise drove home a point to me. I started to identify discretionary and catalytic spending and wondered if we could measure the impact.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">How to Measure Success in Growth Spending</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">I decided that the most critical measure of spending success had to be an increase in net income. If I use revenue to measure success, there is too much of a tendency to give up price and margin to increase volume. There are some risky build-to-sell business strategies that focus on getting sales first and profit later. This approach was used by many online retailers until about 2015 or 2016. Since then, the buyer market for these types of businesses has dried up. Many of those who did buy these companies have remorse and are stuck with businesses that have high revenue, no profit, and no way to become profitable. As my good friend Alan Miltz, creator of cashflowstory.com, says, “Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, and cash flow is king!ˮ</p>
<p class="noindent">I considered using gross margin or contribution margin to measure spending success. Both of these are better than using revenue, but they still allow for giving in on price and stressing the labor support model, even though some extra margin dollars were produced. For as harsh as it may be, profit needed to be my yardstick.</p>
<p class="noindent">Next I had to decide on the time frame. In considering how long to wait for a return, I stuck with my idea for the business model itself: a minimum of 12 months, a maximum of 24 months. Some high-risk, high-return businesses might need longer, but they are in the minority. A business will not reach its fullest growth potential from spending for 12 to 24 months, but it should be far enough along to begin reaping rewards and growing profitably.</p>
<p class="scl"><a id="calibre_link-223" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">A Real-World Example Over Five Years</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">To demonstrate this idea in the real world, a client of ours allowed us to share his phenomenal experience over a five-year growth cycle. Since we held monthly calls with the client during this time, we knew that their catalytic spend was an annual increase in marketing expenses over the previous year’s maintenance spend. Their discretionary choice to add to the annual marketing spend was the first cost; they had the luxury of adding labor and other operating costs only after they knew that new revenue was flowing. Companies will not always have that luxury, but they did. Also, their marketing spending was not transactional, such as spending for AdWords or search engine optimization; it was old-fashioned travel, entertainment, and trade shows.</p>
<p class="noindent">Their story starts in the first year we started working with them when they had $700,000 in revenue. They had just started getting profitable and felt like they needed to risk some new spending to drive their business (see table 6.1).</p>
<p class="noindent">They decided to make a bold move and increase their marketing spend by $121,000 over the previous year’s spend of $75,000. That meant an increase of $60,000 in net income was needed to claim success. You can see that they got close, which is not bad for a first effort with a 45% return. As you can see, their other costs increased, but we know that those were after the marketing spend and after the new revenue streams were known.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-32" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 6.1</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Launch capital example: Year 1</span></i></p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-111" class="calibre4"></a>At this point we have to revisit my three simple rules for business success from Chapter 1 and reevaluate:</p>

<ol class="calibre10">
<li value="1" class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Did they figure out what the market needs? Check! </i>The new revenues and customers were a sign that they were on the right path and there was more market share to be had.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Did they find a way to do it profitably? Check! </i>Their profit was not as high as they would like, but they have a very low capital signature, and even at 5% profit they were cash-flow positive.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">For the amount of required capital, did they achieve a pretax profit of 50% or better return on invested capital (ROIC)? Check! </i>Since their business model allowed them to get paid before they paid their vendors, they were above 50% ROIC, even at 5% net income to revenue.</li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">Let’s look at year 2 in table 6.2. Jackpot!</p>
<p class="noindent">When something works well, do you have the guts to keep going? The company decided they needed to increase spending again, but they wanted to trim the additional amount to $100,000. That means their increase in profit success over the previous year was now defined at $50,000. They had a blend of recurring and onetime customers, so they needed to continue marketing to existing customers and find new ones.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-33" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 6.2</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Launch capital example: Year 2</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00034.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent1a">You can see in table 6.2 that they blew their $50,000 goal out of the water with a 493% return, and their profit jumped to $628,000 at 17% to revenue! Part of this extra profit came from the previous year’s new customers reaching full potential. Unless you <a id="calibre_link-122" class="calibre4"></a>analyze specific customers, it is hard to tell how much came from the current year increase in marketing spend versus the prior year since the company continued to pay for travel to all clients for ongoing marketing and to defend them from competitors. They would definitely benefit from tracking sales growth for both new and existing customers and reporting the results regularly.</p>
<p class="noindent">In two short years this company jumped from $700,000 to $3,600,000 in revenue; more importantly, they jumped to $628,000 in net income at a rate of 17.36%! Should they sit here and harvest, or should they push ahead? This is always a critical juncture for an emerging business, and there are several key questions to answer:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Are you in the black hole? This company is right in the middle of the black hole, which is defined as between $1 million and $5 million in revenue (or in certain circumstances, gross margin). The deepest, darkest moment is usually at $3 million. If you are profitable at $3 million, you are usually functioning with your hair on fire because you have an unsustainable labor structure and not enough, or not the right, management to keep things together. Your only choices are to pull back to $2.5 million or less to maintain sanity and reduce stress, or push through to $5 million and upgrade your management processes and people.</li>
<li class="calibre11">What do you want as an owner? Some people think they have hit the jackpot if they make $600,000 in profit above their market wage. Others want to know if there is more market share to be had.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Are you maintaining 50% ROIC or better as you grow? My client was at well over 100%, which was definitely a green light.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">What did my client decide? To keep going!</p>

<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00029.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre4"></a>They decided to add $400,000 to their spend and really go big. This time, success would be measured as an increase of $200,000 in net income. Well, they missed it. They did have revenue growth, but net income was flat. Some businesses would still call this a success, but I was proud that they did not. Instead, they critically evaluated what happened:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">The things they had historically spent money on stopped working as well. The funny thing about marketing expenses is that the deployment must vary because the market becomes desensitized to your message. It is like seeing a new TV commercial and thinking it is clever at first, but by the 20th time you are sick of it.</li>
<li class="calibre11">There is only so much messaging the market can handle at one time. In software development, adding another programmer can slow down a project; similarly, too much marketing in one area diluted the company’s message and may have aggravated their customers because of too much contact.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Their final conclusion was to rework their maintenance marketing spend and be more judicious about how much new spending to add.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The result worked like a charm for the next two years, as you can see in table 6.4.</p>
<p class="noindent">The company moderated their spend increase for year 4 to $166,000, and once again they knocked it out of the park with a 91% return. Then in year 5 they added another increase of $154,000 to marketing and got an even better return of 286%. Eventually their current spend could be reduced to make their</p>

<p class="noindent">profit go up considerably, but that could backfire because their customers could wonder why they do not hear from the company anymore, why their website still has the same graphics it had five years ago, why their team member page still has pictures of employees who are long gone, and why their last blog post is 18 months old.</p>
<p class="scl"><a id="calibre_link-165" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Consider Your Geography</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">This company’s experience gives hope to any business that has less than $1 million in revenue. It grew from $700,000 to $10 million in revenue in five years, was profitable every year, and used zero debt to get there. As a matter of fact, they were cashflow positive and had plenty of cash to distribute even after taxes were paid. When I show this example, people always ask me what kind of business this is. The answer is not important because most businesses we work with have the same capital signature and profit potential. The one detail I will share is that they are not geographically limited in their customer base.</p>
<p class="noindent">Professor David Wessels from the Wharton School, who introduced me to the power of the ROIC concept, often says, “it is not your share, it is your where.” The next percentage of market share in a limited geography is very costly to acquire, as opposed to gaining an even smaller percentage of market share in a bigger geographical area. There is no way my firm would be as big as we are if we deployed our current business model for just Huntsville, Alabama. We chose to take geography out of our business model, and now 85% of our clients are not in our city. As I often say, “When I am in Huntsville, I am a local CPA; when I leave town, I am an expert.”</p>
<p class="noindent">Not every business model is suited to serve multiple geographies, and some companies that have tried failed miserably because they did not invest in the management and serviceability to make it successful. This goes back to your personal choices. If you do not feel confident or just do not want to expand geographically, then don’t. It is your choice, but remember what Professor Wessels says: <i class="calibre8">where, not share. </i>If you limit yourself geographically, it will be a self-imposed constraint on your business potential, and you must accept the challenges it brings. You can look for ways to overcome any constraint, but you need to be clear that geography choice is a critical business strategy.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-128" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Launch Capital in Discovery Mode</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">I wish I could say that all our clients carefully plan their launch capital and use our accounting structure and reporting process, but entrepreneurs tend to be free wheeling and then retrofit our Simple Numbers analysis on the fly to gain financial clarity.</p>
<p class="noindent">One such example is described later in this section, but first let’s take a look at my firm’s unique Simple Numbers approach. We use it for every client, regardless of industry.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-237" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-351"><b class="calibre5">Simple Numbers Analysis</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">The principles of our Simple Numbers analysis and presentation are as follows:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Every month ends a 12-month accounting cycle</i>. The ending month does not matter; the data is just as meaningful for any given 12 months. Rolling 12 data is the best form of financial truth for profit-and-loss presentations. It eliminates every excuse because it includes an entire year&mdash;all holidays, all four calendar seasons, and all business cycle seasons.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">It reveals behavioral economics. </i>There have been studies on how people use annual and monthly data to make key decisions. The results show that control groups who used only annual data to make buy and sell decisions for stock portfolios traded less frequently and had a higher yield than the group that traded only with monthly information. A month is a horrible unit of time to base decisions on. Accounting processes struggle to effectively report on monthly data, no matter how skilled your finance team is. No months are equal, but all 12-month periods are equal.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Our Simple Numbers summary view is robust and serves clients in all industries for the following reasons:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-65" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">It does not mix labor with cost of goods sold, so gross margin can be used as the true economic top line of the business. </i>Essentially, cost of goods sold are pass-through costs that flow outside your business. They serve only to inflate revenue.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Labor efficiency is clearly defined. </i>Because direct labor and management labor are isolated, rather than mixed with other costs, we can see productivity relationships to measure labor <i class="calibre8">output</i>, not minimize labor as a cost unless it is nonproductive. The addition of productive labor grows a business. Direct labor is held responsible against gross margin, while management labor is held responsible against contribution margin. I will discuss labor efficiency in Chapter 8.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Allocations are eliminated. </i>I am not a fan of allocations in the overall view of financials. I can see that it is necessary in segment reporting to spread certain shared revenue and costs, but I want to show labor that is not loaded for payroll taxes and benefits, nor do I want operating expenses (or overhead) allocated to cost of goods sold or labor. The omission of allocations saves my team time because they do not have to make the adjustments.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">It includes an output number called contribution margin that is the critical number in a business model. </i>My experience with modeling hundreds of businesses has shown that if I know contribution margin dollars, I can model up to revenue and down to net income. It also adds an additional benefit to share with your team. Since it is based on gross wages and gross margin, your team can <a id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre4"></a>easily grasp the output of labor concept. They may not like it if their output measure is poor, but you have to address the truth to make improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The Simple Numbers summary has multiple views to further expand its usefulness. Unfortunately, these views can be generated only in spreadsheets unless you have a good coder or an accounting system with a robust reporting package. Even though these views are simple templates in our spreadsheet models, accounting systems have not made it easy for companies to reproduce them.</p>
<p class="noindent">The views in our Simple Numbers summary are as follows:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Year over year. </i>We start with rolling 12, then move to rolling 3, then finally show monthly. For shorter-term information, I always prefer rolling 3 over monthly.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Last 3 months. </i>Once again, we start with rolling 12. If you look at rolling 12 for the past three months and see it going up every month, real growth is taking place. Conversely, if it is falling, it is a major red flag that needs to be addressed quickly. After rolling 12, we look at rolling 3 and then monthly. The idea is to look at the longest data set first, work our way to the shortest, and not overreact to short-term data.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Year to date. </i>The year-to-date view is good only for estimating taxes. Otherwise, it is an invalid time period for analysis. My own company is a good example. In the year-to-date view we look great through October, then fall off the rest of the year. Most companies lose their butt in the last two months of the year, but we do not look at it that way in our own firm. We always try to beat last year’s November and December, and that always makes our rolling 12 go up!</li>

<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-123" class="calibre4"></a>As we reviewed their performance over the past three years, we could see that revenue increased in the current year (it was flat the previous year), and profit steadily declined to less than half of what it had been. The revenue increase in 20X3 was largely due to price increases we pushed for due to rising costs. Just a 1% decrease in gross margin impacted the bottom line in 20X2 since total operating expenses did not move. The market does not always give you room for a price increase, but when this company increased its prices, their customers did not notice too much.</p>
<p class="noindent">The company was in the later stages of expanding their capacity, so we needed to dig deeper to create a picture of how the existing business was performing and also identify all the launch capital spending that was already seeping into their current operating data. We also needed to identify the annual effect of the price changes, since they had been in effect for only three months. You can see the benefit of rolling 3 data in table 6.6.</p>

<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Launch capital for expansion: Rolling 3 performance</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00021.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-37" class="calibre4"></a>Not every business has consistent activity in every quarter, but when you do have consistency (or a limited seasonal business cycle), rolling 3 is a powerful pacing tool to show a shorter-term picture of your business performance. From this case example, we immediately learned from the company’s rolling 3 data that they hit a new high in contribution margin and its percentage to sales. Like I said earlier, contribution margin is <i class="calibre8">the </i>critical number because it shows the productive output of the business engine, and it gives you more choice about what to spend your operating expenses on.</p>
<p class="noindent">After we spotted this company’s encouraging trend, we then extrapolated it to an annual number (see table 6.7) and evaluated it from there.</p>
</div>

<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00031.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-38" class="calibre4"></a>By annualizing the quarter, we saw that the price increase had put the company on its best contribution margin path. Now we could focus on the operating expenses. By annualizing them, we could see the following:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Facilities expense was up because of spending on the new expansion.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Marketing expense was up for the cost of announcing the expanded capacity to customers.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The increase in management labor reflected hiring new staff members that would not otherwise have been needed.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The increase in other operating expenses included consulting fees of $50,000 for the expansion. The increase in total operating expenses was $690,000, which was purely for the new capacity. If the company had not started the expansion process and just raised prices, they would have netted $1,068,881 in profit (or maybe more, without the distraction).</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">It would not have been enough for us to tell the company only how much they would have made. They also needed to know that their new profit target, after the expansion was open, had to incorporate the 50% return on the expenses that were hiding in the profit-and-loss statement. Since they spent $690,000, their profit target for next year would be $345,000 higher. If all went according to plan, they would be looking at net profit of $1,657,987 after the new capacity had been online for a full year. Otherwise, they would have to question their strategy or their execution of the growth plans. I had the utmost confidence that this company could meet or exceed that target.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-112" class="calibre4"></a>Traditional accounting reporting was not designed for this level of insight. You need to have a clear understanding of what costs support your ongoing business and develop a way to tag spending in every major category that you determine was not needed to maintain the current business. By default, that is what you are betting your profits on. This is totally different from retaining profits to fund increases in trade capital or repay debt. When you use profit to fund those elements, you can get your money back by reborrowing the debt you paid or collecting the receivable you funded. But when you make an expense bet, or what I call a catalytic spend, when your growth plan fails to launch, there is no getting your money back. When you put your money on the roulette wheel and the spin does not go your way, the pit boss is not going to give you your money back and let you try again.</p>
<p class="scl"><b class="calibre5">Accounting Techniques for Longer-Term Launch</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">The sure way every accounting system can account for launch capital is to have specific general ledger accounts set up for those costs and tag them as they are incurred. Most systems have divisional accounting capability, and you can set up launch capital as a division. Otherwise you need to make a good enough monthly estimate of what the discretionary spend was and track it offline, like we do in the custom forecast models we run for our clients.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another approach we are using for a software development client is to track all the labor and contractor costs on their balance sheet during the prelaunch phase of the software. This allows us to see the cumulative investment and feel the pressure build up to see what the final status will look like; then we can either get the software launched or stop development if we see that it costs considerably more than anticipated. We can also adjust our tax estimate planning, since most of that cost can be deducted in the year it is spent.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-227" class="calibre4"></a>This is a great example of how to not let tax thinking drive your mindset. At the same time, it is beneficial to deduct the cost of building or expanding a product or service, to lower your cash outflow by the same amount as the tax benefit. But remember: it is never a good idea to spend a dollar to save 40 cents in tax! Spend only on things you believe will be more profitable than the amount of your investment.</p>

<p class="sc"><i class="calibre8">A man who aims at nothing hits it<br class="calibre9" />with amazing accuracy!</i></p>
<p class="center">&ndash; Greg Crabtree</p>
<p class="noindent1a">Throughout my accounting career, I always cringed at the sound of the word “budget.” It probably goes all the way back to growing up on the farm. My mom was the finance person, and my dad was the farmer. I do not remember my mom ever keeping a budget, but she always had a plan for how to build and move forward. Her plan even factored into how she sent me to college. I had a checkbook with no balance written in, just an instruction for me to spend only what I needed. When I came home every two weeks, I would transfer the checks I wrote into her checkbook and account for my actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">This technique may not work for every college student. Even though my mom weighed only 100 pounds and had red hair and freckles, I did not want to get her mad, and I also wanted to earn her respect by being responsible. I often say that budgets are a license to spend and that planning and forecasts are tools of growth and profitability. In Chapter 10 I will explain my alternative process for budgeting.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-92" class="calibre4"></a>Our planning process always starts with establishing a target. A target is one specifically defined goal you want to reach. In contrast, a forecast is when you plan ahead and predict a course. Planning processes usually fall short in one of these two ways:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">You make a plan for the year but do not take into account the ramping effect of what you are currently doing. If your plan is to increase sales by 10%, it will take time to reach that number as your new sales initiatives roll out. You might fall short of 10% in the first half of the year, so your sales will have to increase by 12% to 15% in the last half of the year to average out to 10% overall. If you do not consider ramp-up time, you will be constantly disappointed in your planning.</li>
<li class="calibre11">You build your plan for the year on a monthly incremental basis, but you miss the bigger opportunity of stopping activities that are unproductive because you are always thinking in increments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">You can negate these shortcomings if you first establish a target you want to attain within one to two years and then build a forecast to get there. Do not be bound by calendar or fiscal years; give yourself the freedom of the rolling 12 view. Once you establish a picture of what you want your target to look like, you can build a weekly, monthly, and quarterly plan for how to get from here to there. If this is January and it will take 15 months to reach your target, then your rolling 12 around March of next year will tell you if your forecast hit your target. If you can hit your target sooner, great! If it takes longer, that is fine as long as your plan is still realistic and still takes you where you want to go.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-213" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">The Forecasting and Targeting Process</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Over the years I have seen that the forecast models developed by our clients, or by other consultants, are usually lacking in one or more of these areas:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Forecast has too many details and levels.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Forecast accounts for only profit and loss.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Forecast time period is based on a year and is not rolling.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Model does not allow for easy updating throughout the year.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In addition, the balance sheet and cash flow report need to accomplish the following:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Reasonably predict accounts receivable, inventory (if applicable), accounts payable, term debt repayment, automatic withdrawals, and repayment of line of credit.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Plan for quarterly estimated tax payments (for US businesses) or plan for taxes and a payment schedule (for international businesses).</li>
<li class="calibre11">Plan for any shareholder dividends payments expected or driven from meeting performance goals.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">When we create our custom forecasting model for our clients, we make sure it can be updated with minimal effort by incorporating the following:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">We store the source data on one tab.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-194" class="calibre4"></a>Any presentation of data needed is on a separate tab that pulls from the source data, to avoid having to input data on the presentation tab.</li>
<li class="calibre11">We do not use blank columns as spacers because they make it harder to copy data to the next column during updating.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The current month of actual data can be dropped in and rolled forward with every month end close.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">My favorite tab we use in our model is aptly named the Thinking Model. Not only is this worksheet useful to set performance targets, but it is also a good tool for exploring what-if scenarios; setting minimum, target, and stretch performance levels; and verifying that if any new revenue growth occurs, it benefits the bottom line.</p>
</div>

<div id="calibre_link-183" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-355"><b class="calibre5">Thinking Model Example</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">The Thinking Model example in this section shows the last three years of actual performance data in our Simple Numbers analytical format. The example business is a services contractor that coordinates other contractors and materials. Each contract is worth $500,000 or more in revenue, and the revenue can swing wildly depending on the company’s success in winning contracts. The contracts usually take 6 to 12 months to complete, and the company recognizes revenue as costs are incurred on contracts.</p>
<p class="noindent">You can see in table 7.1 that revenue went down in year 2, yet the company’s direct labor costs stayed about the same. This is a great example of my launch capital concept, described in Chapter 6, because the company bet they could win the right contracts to increase revenue in year 3 if they increased their marketing spend (mainly bid and proposal costs) and beefed up their management team ahead of the awards to handle the significant increase in</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-228" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 7.1</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Thinking model: Years 1 through 3</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00010.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="text1"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">* dLER is direct labor efficiency ratio. mLER is management labor efficiency ratio.</span></i></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-39" class="calibre4"></a>volume. This was a bold move to say the least, but they were confident in their ability and had just enough cash and borrowing power to dig out of the year 2 hole. As we review their performance throughout this example, we will keep track to see if their launch capital spend met the 50% return standard.</p>
<p class="noindent">Notice in table 7.1 that direct labor stayed essentially the same from year 1 to year 2. This was a strategic decision that is hard for entrepreneurs to make. They had built a team of employees they wanted to keep, and the company believed they would need the team in year 3. If they had trimmed their staff to keep in line with year 1 performance, they would have cut direct labor by $291,250 to get their direct labor efficiency ratio (dLER) up to $3.20&mdash;that is, $3.20 of gross margin for every direct labor dollar spent&mdash;which was their performance in year 1. This demonstrates the two labor plays in business: you either flex the labor to what you sell, or you sell to cover your committed labor level. The business in this example committed to their labor level and increased sales to cover it, which took a year. Since the sales to cover the excess labor did not occur in the same year, their overspending of labor essentially became launch capital. They did not <i class="calibre8">have </i>to spend this money; they <i class="calibre8">chose </i>to spend it.</p>
<p class="noindent">The next increase you can see in table 7.1 is marketing. The increase was due mostly to travel and contractor costs to assist in the bidding and proposal work. The increase of $75,000 from year 1 to year 2 is launch capital because it was spent to move the business above the current revenue level.</p>
<p class="noindent">You can see in table 7.1 that the company’s management labor cost also increased; like direct labor, this increase was a choice, not a need. The company knew it would need to fill new leadership roles if they were to take the company to the next level. This addition of management labor is a critical point that I refer to as the black hole (see Chapter 6). Recall that the black hole is the <a id="calibre_link-216" class="calibre4"></a>journey between $1 million and $5 million in revenue or gross margin in some circumstances. I have found that when gross margin is below 40%, it becomes the true top line of the business. For the example in table 7.1, the company’s gross margin percentage to sales was 30% or less&mdash;$4 million in year 1&mdash;and was their true top line. If you ever want to compare your business to another business in a different industry, use gross margin as the top line.</p>
<p class="noindent">The company realized they had cheated the management labor bucket in getting to a gross margin of $4 million in year 1. They knew they would need to rebuild their management team to get to the next level, dropping some team members who could not grow further in their roles and adding key team members to cover tasks that had previously been part-time responsibilities of overworked leaders. This is the best way to traverse the black hole. The fix is not quick, and it often carries the pain of a losing year, even if you get it right; it could take a couple of years if you get it wrong.</p>
<p class="noindent">For launch capital purposes, the catalytic spend (or bet) on additional management labor in year 2 was $325,000 (table 7.1). The company did not need that increase to maintain where they were, so the total increase included raises, bonuses, and new people minus employees who left. I generally do not include the increases in payroll tax and benefits, since this cost is a reaction to the new management labor spend, but you would not be wrong if you wanted to include it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Other operating expenses also increased due to some one-time consultants who helped with the transition, so another $50,000 is added to the launch capital tally.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s recap the launch capital spends in year 2 (table 7.1):</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Direct labor cost exceeded the company’s need by $291,250.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-40" class="calibre4"></a>Marketing increased by $75,000.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Management labor increased by $325,000.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The increase in other operating expenses included $50,000 in consulting fees.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The total launch capital spend in year 2 was $741,250. Therefore, the minimum increase in profit needed from year 1 to year 3, at 50%, is $370,625.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Let’s evaluate the company’s launch capital spend in year 2. They invested $741,250, and the profit increased from $955,000 in year 1 to $1,955,000 in year 3, an increase of $1,000,000. To measure the return, take the increase in profit of $1,000,000 and divide it by the cost of $741,250 to get the annual return of 135%. This company placed a risky bet, but it definitely paid off! These are the kinds of risks entrepreneurs take all the time to grow their business and create wealth. Incremental bets throughout the life of the business are far more critical to its success than any initial investment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before we set the company’s next performance target, there are a few things to note on year 3 in table 7.1:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Gross margin. </i>Gross margin as a percentage to sales increased to 30% from 27%. In this case, the change is neither good nor bad, since it is essentially pass-through costs. They are not controlled by the company, but rather by the customer as stated in the contract. The change would matter if the company controlled the source or the price, or if they had to pay the costs before they get paid by their customer. The company is not focused on revenue at all; they are focused on gross margin dollars.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-230" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">Direct labor</i>. You can see that dLER dropped from $3.20 in year 1 to $3.10 in year 3. This represents a potential opportunity for margin improvement in the future if the company can return to a better performance level, which we will model and quantify in the next section.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Management labor efficiency. </i>Management labor efficiency (mLER) hit a new high at $3.75 and is a new company standard that helps establish a salary cap for new management hires, and it establishes a ceiling for raises and bonuses. In the next section I will discuss how to use this key performance indicator to hold your management team accountable for true economic output.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Operating expenses</i>. We look at operating expenses as a percentage to their relative measure. At the bottom of table 7.1 you can see we measure facilities and other operating expenses against contribution margin; marketing against revenue; and payroll tax and benefits against all labor.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Facilities costs. </i>These are gradually increasing. Since most facilities costs are fixed, be aware of significant spending like adding new space that is more expensive.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Marketing and payroll tax and benefits</i>. These have settled into a stable pattern and can be predicted by the historical percentage unless the company’s activity changes relative to these categories.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Other operating expenses. </i>This a catchall bucket for business costs. You can see that they normalized as a percentage of contribution margin in year 3 after the down year.</li>
</ul>
<div class="box">
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-41" class="calibre13"></a><b class="calibre5">Lagging Variable Cost</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">I refer to other operating expenses as a lagging variable cost. If the company experiences a downturn, you cannot simply shut off these expenses; similarly, they do not immediately increase when the company grows. These expenses often lag six months to a year.</p>
<p class="noindent">I have never found it helpful to forecast at the line item level. If a client uses line items, I can usually beat their accuracy by using a percentage and identifying which discretionary decisions in this cost pool will be significantly different.</p>
</div>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Setting the Next Target: Levels of Attainment</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Most entrepreneurs continually look for next year’s target, but remember that you can use the targeting process described in this chapter any time you need to make a business change to capture an opportunity or to correct underperformance. My preferred approach is to view these targets as levels of attainment&mdash;which I call the minimum, target, and stretch levels&mdash;that could occur on a rolling 12 basis in any given month. Through monthly forecasting, you can have an idea of when you might hit the targets, but we all know that sometimes plans do not turn out as expected. If you use the minimum, target, and stretch levels to drive bonus plans, the levels will generally be dependent on time, but you could establish a one-time bonus when a key level is hit on a rolling 12.</p>
<p class="noindent">To establish a working area in the Thinking Model, we will take the lessons we learned from the past three years of performance. We look for the company’s best data points, then establish our planned performance levels.</p>
<p class="scl"><a id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Setting the Minimum Level</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">We start with setting the minimum level of attainment. For illustration, table 7.2 shows only year 3, which is carried over from table 7.1.</p>
<p class="noindent">This plan is developed using the Simple Numbers bottom-up targeting process. After studying how entrepreneurs really think, we learned that most of them start with what they want to spend money on and work up from there. The most common thing they want to spend money on is labor to get the job done.</p>
<p class="noindent">Tables 7.2 and 7.3 break down each step in the following bottomup targeting process, but in practice this is all done at one time. The results from the steps are inserted into table 7.3, which contains columns for the minimum, target, and stretch levels of attainment. The calculations occur in the following order:</p>
<p class="no">1. Identify the management team’s annual wages and, from history, establish the mLER you want to hold them accountable to.</p>
<p class="no">2. From table 7.2, multiply the management labor contribution margin times mLER to get the contribution margin for the minimum column in table 7.3.</p>
<p class="no">3. Once contribution margin is established, we estimate direct labor needs.</p>
<p class="noa">a. Determine the expected level of dLER. For the minimum level, I usually set it at the previous year’s level unless there are anomalies that impact it either way. In our example, we set the minimum level the same as year 3; that is, $3.10.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-42" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 7.2</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Thinking Model: Working area for targeting process</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00016.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noa">b. We know both contribution margin and dLER, so from table 7.3 in the minimum column, the formula to calculate direct labor dollars is contribution margin divided by (dLER minus 1.00):<br class="calibre9" /><br class="calibre9" /><b class="calibre6">$5,625,000 / (3.10 &ndash; 1.00) = $2,678,571</b><br class="calibre9" /><br class="calibre9" /><a id="calibre_link-169" class="calibre4"></a>That is the hardest math I will make you do! Just remember to solve inside the parentheses first, then solve the rest of the equation.</p>
<p class="no">4. Gross margin (minimum column in table 7.3) is found by adding direct labor and contribution margin.<br class="calibre9" /><br class="calibre9" /><b class="calibre6">$2,678,571.43 + $5,625,000.00 = $8,303,571.43</b><br class="calibre9" /><br class="calibre9" />Gross margin is assumed to remain the same until we see it move. As I said before, it is more important to build a target based on gross margin dollars, regardless of revenue; however, I agree that the minimum level of gross margin percentage needs to be acceptable.</p>
<p class="no">5. Revenue is simply gross margin dollars divided by gross margin as a percentage to sales (table 7.3, minimum column).<br class="calibre9" /><br class="calibre9" /><b class="calibre6">$8,303,571.43 / 0.3 = $27,678,571.43</b></p>
<p class="no">6. Once you know revenue, labor, and contribution margin, you predict operating expenses based on percentages (shown at the bottom of tables 7.2 and 7.3); the exception is facilities, which I usually estimate since it changes only by choice.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-226" class="calibre4"></a>Now that you have a grasp of how the math works and its sequence in a single attainment level, we can explore how all three levels work together. But before we move on to the target level, let’s review some key points about establishing the minimum level:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">The minimum level is usually carried over from the prior year.</li>
<li class="calibre11">You would rarely establish a minimum level that is below the prior year unless there are challenges you cannot control, such as the loss of a key contract or customer without an identified replacement, or if a key employee or group of employees leaves and their departure reduces your potential output or sales volume.</li>
<li class="calibre11">If you know that the current momentum of your business will carry you higher, you might need to establish the minimum level higher than the prior year. To use a basketball term, there is no need for a lay-up in the planning process.</li>

<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-356"><b class="calibre5">Setting the Target Level</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Your major focus should be on setting the target level. Ideally, your target level will be a blend of what you already have in place, the expected outcome of key initiatives you have defined with and assigned to your team, priorities that can reasonably be accomplished, and business results realized during the planning year.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here are the key points in the target level column of table 7.3:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The mLER increases to 4.00 while management labor dollars stay constant. </i>The thinking here is that the investment in new management labor increased the capacity for handling further growth. This tells <a id="calibre_link-231" class="calibre4"></a>the management team that even though there was good performance in year 3, the company was still paying for the future and had not achieved optimal performance. In the team’s celebration of rebounding in year 3 (see table 7.1), it is easy for them to feel that they have earned their pay and deserve more, while you think they have not yet fully delivered on what you are already paying them for.
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11">Pay should chase performance whenever possible. It is easy to get pulled into paying before you see demonstrated performance. This always happens with a new hire, since they are unproven, but you should always avoid paying ahead for existing team members. The exception is promotions; you do not know ahead of time if the promoted person can handle their new role.<br class="calibre9" /><br class="calibre9" />When you set the desired target for mLER, ask yourself if your current team can produce at this level and not expect to get additional labor dollars to spend on new hires, raises, or bonuses. If you believe they can, you have to overtly set that expectation; be prepared for pushback because they will naturally want more as they produce more. Your argument here is that you pay a market-based wage for market performance. By paying a market-based wage, as confirmed by wage surveys and other market sources, then setting market performance levels through planning, you can help temper your team’s pay expectations.</li>
</ul>

<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The dLER holds steady at $3.10 from year 3.</i> Entrepreneurs often ask me what a good labor efficiency ratio is. I usually tell them the answer is in <a id="calibre_link-174" class="calibre4"></a>their own data. If you look at your company history, you can usually find a time when your company hit a record in its rate of performance. I mostly look only at rolling 12 data to find the record, but sometimes I have to look at rolling 3 to see what is possible if underperformance is not a seasonal issue and rather a lack of focus and performance. In table 7.3, we did not increase the dLER, since the company was still growing into its new labor. We postponed the increase to the stretch level.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Gross margin as a percentage to sales holds at the most recent historical percentage. </i>I never change the gross margin percentage unless there is a demonstrated trend or an action that we know will impact it. This is where gross margin thinking comes in handy. Some of our most successful clients have finally eliminated the word “revenue” from their vocabulary. It is not about revenue dollars, it is all about gross margin dollars. These same clients have removed all incentives based on revenue and replaced them with either contribution margin or gross margin.
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11">My preference is to base sales incentives on contribution margin since it comes after direct labor has been applied. Salespeople complain that they do not have control over direct labor, but I say they do. They need to get to know the direct labor team and make sure they sell what the team does best, not sell stuff just to make a commission. Conversely, the direct labor team needs to spend time with the salespeople to let them know what the team does best because, if the salespeople do not sell those things, the direct labor team starves!</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-44" class="calibre4"></a>If I cannot win my argument on contribution margin, gross margin is my next preferred sales incentive basis. If I cannot specifically calculate cost of goods sold (COGS) on each sale, I will still use gross margin and apply a trailing calculation of gross margin to keep salespeople focused on not using price alone in their sales negotiations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Other operating expenses are handled the same in the target level as in the minimum level. </i>The only possible increase is if the marketing spend needs to go up as a percentage to revenue, depending on how much of a revenue increase you project. In table 7.3, no additional marketing budget is needed to accomplish revenue goals; the increased amount reflects what is needed to increase the effectiveness of the marketing efforts.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The revenue increase of $1,845,238 is the result of our bottom-up technique. </i>This is where we evaluate the work output and see if it is reasonable and meets our goals. In this case, it hits what the company felt was available in the market and what their marketing plans could reasonably bring in during the year. If the revenue number were off, the first adjustment would be to move mLER up or down as needed. If it produced a net income less than your desired target, you might even look at reducing management labor by eliminating poor performers or unneeded roles. It is not uncommon to overhire in a growth phase, thinking you need certain roles, only to discover later that the role was not needed or could be combined with another role.</li>
</ul>
<p class="scl"><a id="calibre_link-45" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Setting the Stretch Level</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Now that we have established the minimum and target performance levels, we move to the stretch level. This reflects what could theoretically happen, but the likelihood falls into the 25% to 50% range. I am not a fan of making the stretch level so high that there is no reasonable chance of it happening.</p>
<p class="noindent">The main parameters we normally use are as follows (see table 7.3):</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The mLER moves up to $4.25, and the management labor dollars increase by $200,000, which raises contribution margin by $1,225,000</i>. If you surpass this target, you will need to give bonuses or raises, or you will need to add supporting labor. I prefer to design bonus plans that include these payouts in the performance target that has to be reached, or set the target high enough that the company still keeps money after the bonus is paid.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Direct labor and dLER go up. </i>I set the dLER target back to the historical best of $3.20 (year 1 in table 7.1), which will lower the direct labor needed if there is not a revenue increase. Since we raised mLER to $4.25 and added management labor, we need to add $426,948 of direct labor to support the contribution margin volume.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">All operating expense percentages stay constant (bottom of table 7.3) because there are no conditions that warrant changing them. </i>There could be a small increase in facilities, unless you add space, but resist trimming any of the other operating expense percentages until you see them drop on a rolling 12 basis for several months. For most businesses we work with, there are not enough areas you can cut in these buckets and remain sustainable; however, there are a few exceptions that will go away, like high-cost consulting.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-90" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">The net results for the stretch level are revenue of $35 million and net income of $3.2 million.</i></li>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-357"><b class="calibre5">Evaluating the Plan</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">We have considered various scenarios, done the math, and developed a new plan that looks great on paper, but is it realistic? To answer that question, we need to look at several areas.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-21" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-358"><b class="calibre5">Market Maturity</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Is the company in our example facing a mature market for their product or service in their designated service area? Table 7.1 shows the company jumped to a reasonable level of market maturity with their growth from year 2 to year 3. In year 3 they will be more focused on maintaining what they have, with some incremental improvement, until they define their next major market move. If your company is in the midst of a major growth initiative, this would not demonstrate enough growth between levels.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-20" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-359"><b class="calibre5">Performance and Efficiency</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Is the company maintaining its performance and improving in labor efficiency ratio measures? The number one way to make more profit is to improve how you leverage both direct labor and management labor. This company’s plan accomplishes improvement in both, but there is only marginal improvement in direct labor. Once you pass $5 million in direct labor, it becomes harder to see significant changes in dLER without a major overhaul of processes. In the example, the company is planning only minor improvements in dLER that can usually be accomplished with improved focus.</p>

<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-360"><b class="calibre5">Return on Invested Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">What is the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC)? This is the real question to determine how good a plan is. The full cash <a id="calibre_link-166" class="calibre4"></a>flow forecast model gives you that number, but I will show you how to calculate the elements of invested capital here.</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Trade capital. </i>You can use several calculations to figure trade capital.
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11">Using the historical estimate of days in accounts receivable (AR), you can predict the average AR you will have to carry at the given revenue level:<br class="calibre9" /><br class="calibre9" /><b class="calibre6">AR / 365 = Day of sales</b><br class="calibre9" /><br class="calibre9" /><b class="calibre6">Day of sales x Days of AR = Average AR</b></li>
<li class="calibre11">Using the historical average of day of accounts payable (AP), you can calculate an estimate of AP:<br class="calibre9" /><br class="calibre9" /><b class="calibre6">Annual COGS / 365 = Day of COGS</b><br class="calibre9" /><br class="calibre9" /><b class="calibre6">Day of COGS x Days in AP = Average AP support from vendors</b></li>
<li class="calibre11">Other trade capital elements that could be present are assets you have to fund (inventory, work in progress, prepaid job expenses) and liabilities that help reduce asset carry (deferred revenue, customer deposits, accrued expenses).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Infrastructure capital</i>. This is the simplest type of capital because you estimate the net book value of fixed assets and intangible assets, and subtract the debt that is directly associated with them.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Buffer capital</i>. This is the core capital target concept I discussed in my previous book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits! </i>A fully capitalized business is one that <a id="calibre_link-46" class="calibre4"></a>has no line of credit balance that is funding AR or inventory, plus the business has two months of operating expenses and labor in cash. Essentially, it is anything a company does not get terms on.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Launch capital</i>. There is no launch capital for the planning year since we are not making any discretionary spending bets, like we did in year 2.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The capital calculations for our example company are shown in table 7.4, along with the resulting ROIC for the minimum, target, and stretch levels we developed in table 7.3.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-253" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-361"><b class="calibre5">Table 7.4</b></h2>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Capital calculations and ROIC for minimum, target, and stretch levels</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00033.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-167" class="calibre4"></a>You can see that the company is meeting my minimum ROIC standard of 50% at all three levels of their plan, ranging from 74% to 90%. Why would you not keep enough cash in this business to protect an <i class="calibre8">annual </i>return of 74% to 90%? The tricky part is whether this business is growing at those return levels without taking too much risk. Owning your own business and effectively balancing its growth and profit strategies is one of the best ways to build wealth, but there is nothing easy or automatic about it!</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Leveraging $1 of Management Labor</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">When we complete a targeting session, the last thing I bring into focus for the client’s management team is how much revenue they need to add for every added dollar of management labor. Most companies fixate on the leverage of their direct labor, which is important; but the leverage on management labor separates great businesses from the rest.</p>
<p class="noindent">To illustrate this point, let’s go back to our example company and three key metrics from the target level (table 7.3).</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">mLER is $4.00.</li>
<li class="calibre11">dLER is $3.10.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Gross margin as a percentage to sales is 30%.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Now we can make the following calculation:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">$1 of management labor times mLER is $4.00 of contribution margin.</li>
<li class="calibre11">$4 of contribution margin divided by (dLER minus 1) is $1.90 of direct labor.<br class="calibre9" /><br class="calibre9" /><b class="calibre6">$4 / ($3.10 &ndash; 1) = $1.90</b></li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-168" class="calibre4"></a>Contribution margin of $4 plus direct labor of $1.90 is $5.90 of gross margin.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Gross margin of $5.90 divided by 30% is $19.66!</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">For every dollar of management labor added in this business (a raise, a bonus, or a new body), the company will need to add $19.66 of revenue to stay at the same rate of profitability, given that the key metrics stay the same.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is an example of how the term “scaling” is often misapplied. In some businesses, the founder thinks that costs will stay constant or go down as the business grows. While this can be true up to $5 million in revenue, it is rarely true past that level except in a few rare business models. More commonly, you lose margin as you grow and have to compete with the major market players. ROIC is what scales; it gets better as you grow because most elements of your capital signature get more efficient if they are managed properly. Scaling is more about market penetration than improved margins with growth. If your operating margins get better as you surpass $5 million, you are in a special class.</p>
<p class="noindent">The example company in this chapter has a low gross margin (i.e., 40% or below), and recall that I look at gross margin as the true top line of the business for this level of gross margin. You can see that it takes almost $6 of gross margin for every dollar of added management labor. I have done this calculation countless times. For businesses with a higher gross margin, it comes out in a range of $6 to $10 for revenue. If the company’s gross margin is below 40%, it hits the same range for gross margin dollars. It always shocks people to see this, and it gives them a new perspective on why they need to hold management more accountable to deliver contribution margin, not just revenue.</p>

<p class="sc"><i class="calibre8">Labor is the only cost that comes to work every<br class="calibre9" />day with an attitude! Monitor and manage it<br class="calibre9" />to optimal performance to win the game.</i></p>
<p class="center">&ndash; Greg Crabtree</p>
<p class="noindent1a">Since I created the Simple Numbers approach to analyzing data, I have become associated with the term “labor efficiency ratio,” affectionately known as LER. It has become a key diagnostic and management tool for those who adopt it. Like all tools, it can take time to master, but it has proven to be effective at keeping track of productivity for both direct and management labor.</p>
<p class="noindent">In my first book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!</i>, I talked about overall LER, which is gross margin divided by all labor. This measure can be effective for businesses under $5 million in revenue that do not have a clear distinction of what is direct labor and what is management labor. Also, when I wrote my previous book, I had not completed enough sample data sets in which we broke out direct labor and management labor to confidently report on how to separate them. Since then, we have divided LER into the two types of labor with all our clients; we have even taken LER down to the segment reporting level with great effectiveness.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-232" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Uniqueness of LER in Financial Analysis</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">There is a good reason for why you will never see LER in a public company’s financial statement. They do not want you to see labor broken out by type because you would be able to identify the most critical aspect of their business management strategy (for better or worse). If there is any mention of labor in the financial statement, it focuses on some portion of labor, but it is typically hidden in other costs.</p>
<p class="sca"><i class="calibre14">Labor should never be mixed with another cost.<br class="calibre9" />It is the only cost that comes to work<br class="calibre9" />every day with an attitude!</i></p>
<p class="noindent">When we did our original research, it became painfully obvious that labor dollars measured against some form of margin was a more intuitively correct analysis than measuring bodies per revenue dollar. A CEO can always make a quick change to make the labor ratio look better by slashing the lowest end of the pay spectrum, but that is usually not where the fix is needed. We also homed in on a point that every business owner should understand: labor must be broken out and never mixed with a nonlabor cost, because it is the only cost that comes to work every day with an attitude! Labor is a variable output cost that largely depends on your management skill, strategy, and sometimes your willpower!</p>

<div id="calibre_link-26" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-362"><b class="calibre5">LER Formulas and Labor Divisions</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Recall the following ratios we have been using throughout this book:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Direct labor efficiency ratio (dLER) = Gross margin divided by direct labor</li>
<li class="calibre11">Management labor efficiency ratio (mLER) = Contribution margin divided by management labor</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-189" class="calibre4"></a>We do not use revenue as a numerator, due to the pass-through nature of cost of goods sold (COGS). Since COGS can vary by business model and by customer interaction, using revenue as the numerator does not allow for accurate comparison. Gross margin is the first dollar you can spend internally; therefore, it is the true top line of your business and should be used to hold direct labor accountable for performance.</p>
<p class="noindent">This brings up an interesting challenge for your sales team. They must focus on gross margin and contribution margin, not revenue. Otherwise they put unbearable pressure on your labor to perform without enough margin. I want my sales team to sell what we do best, not just sell anything they can and always default to price adjustments to win the deal. Granted, the sales team does not control labor, but they cannot ignore it in pricing and sell the impossible.</p>
<p class="noindent">Management labor must focus on three variables:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Drive revenue</li>
<li class="calibre11">Control COGS (pass-through costs)</li>
<li class="calibre11">Manage direct labor</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Management is an active function, not simply a position. When someone wants to move from daily production to management, it is often code for wanting more money and authority over people, instead of the desire to commit to a management role. In the old days of layered management, these types of positions existed, but they were the first to get cut in a layoff. In today’s flat management structure, there is no place for passive management roles if the company wants to be a top performer.</p>
<p class="noindent">How do you create a distinction between direct labor and management labor? I start by identifying the personnel who are <a id="calibre_link-218" class="calibre4"></a>direct labor, then management labor is everybody else. As long as your methodology is consistent, your data will be good. Beware of comparing your company to the industry as a whole or any benchmark data unless you know how the numbers are compiled. Your best guidance lies within your own data. Set your own performance standards instead of measuring yourself against someone who might be running a different strategy.</p>
<p class="noindent">While you consider which staff members are direct labor, keep these points in mind:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Customer-facing team members are direct labor.</li>
<li class="calibre11">People who sell or deliver products or services are direct labor.</li>
<li class="calibre11">If a person has a split role&mdash;partially direct labor and partially management&mdash;do not split the person. We call this the butt-in-a-bucket approach. A person is either all direct labor or all management. If they spend 50% or more of their time doing what your business does, they are direct labor.</li>
<li class="calibre11">If your own role will eventually be all management, classify yourself as management labor and try to delegate your direct labor duties to minimize those tasks.</li>
<li class="calibre11">In professional service firms, we classify all billable personnel as direct labor. I am considered direct labor because I spend about 45% of my time facing the customer. I would give up my CEO role before I would give up my direct duties. Similarly, billable doctors, lawyers, and engineers are direct labor.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-87" class="calibre4"></a>If your company primarily sells stuff, your salespeople are direct labor, and your sales manager or VP is management labor. If your company primarily makes stuff and you employ a couple of people to sell what your direct labor produces, those salespeople go into management labor; they can be separately reported as a segment of management labor.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Direct labor encompasses the total wages of employees.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Do not separate their nonbillable or time-off costs into another line. Do not include payroll tax and benefits in wages. Control them as a separate pool of costs. The one exception is that some staffing companies include payroll tax because they have such a thin margin.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Once you have identified direct labor, then everybody else is management labor, including administrative support personnel.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Case Study: Aspire to Serve Inc.</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Now you know how to separate direct labor from management labor, so let’s look at a case study called Aspire to Serve Inc. (ATSi), with data set created from a blend of client experiences, and explore how to use LER.</p>
<p class="noindent">In table 8.1, the first thing you notice about ATSi is they are right in the middle of the black hole I have mentioned before; that is, the journey between $1 million and $5 million in revenue, which is usually filled with the greatest challenges. At $3 million in revenue, ATSi must choose a key strategy: either stretch their team as far as they can and then backfill, or invest in labor ahead of growth and trust their sales process and access to debt or capital to fund that growth.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-47" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 8.1</b></p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-48" class="calibre4"></a>Most entrepreneurs have a tendency to grow their way out of their lack of profitability. We often refer to this as stage 1 of denial. Although growing is indeed a viable option to improve performance, experience tells us that most unprofitable businesses have some unproductive costs that need to be fixed first. Notice that I did not specifically say they need to cut costs. The amount they are spending for labor, or anything else, may be the correct amount; it may be that they are spending on the wrong source. A different person or vendor at the same cost might be more productive. My job is to educate entrepreneurs on their options, and they get to decide which approach they want to take.</p>

<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-363"><b class="calibre5">Forecast and Year 2 Results</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">We engaged with ATSi just after the first quarter ended for year 2. Let’s look at the key highlights of their initial plan (table 8.1):</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">They forecasted 12% annual revenue growth over the previous year.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Although they planned to spend fewer marketing dollars, they expected their efforts to be more effective, at 9.3% as a percentage to sales, if their sales growth materializes.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The major plan to increase profit comes in the dLER ratio, which is expected to rise to $3.02 by keeping their labor cost flat and increasing revenue by 12%. That is not a bad strategy, as long as you have the right people in the right seats, and they have capacity.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The company predicts a $100,000 reduction in operating expenses by trimming in a few places and increasing management labor, primarily to compensate the owner at a market wage and reduce their need for distributions. (A $50,000 increase was not enough to get them to market and get off distributions, but it was a start.)</li>
<li class="calibre11">If their forecast comes to fruition, they would use all the profit to reduce their line of credit and improve their return <a id="calibre_link-49" class="calibre4"></a>on invested capital (ROIC). They would not owe taxes, since they had an unused loss carrying over from year 1. (In this example, I am counting the line of credit as temporary capital, since it indicates they are undercapitalized by the amount due on their line of credit.)</li>
<li class="calibre11">Assuming this forecast holds true, the line of credit balance will drop to $31,000 and cash will stay the same if there are no distributions and accounts receivable stays roughly the same at year end.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Let’s look at table 8.2 and see what happened!</p>
</div>

<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00037.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-50" class="calibre4"></a>Table 8.2 proves that business is a lot harder than putting numbers on a spreadsheet! Notice the following:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Although ATSi had the greatest of intentions, their annual revenue growth goal did not materialize.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The company realized that some customers and service offerings were not profitable. They started trimming underperforming labor and cutting unprofitable customers, and they dropped some services that were losing money late in the year when they realized they did not have the right people in the right seats. You will see more of the labor trimming effect in year 3.</li>
<li class="calibre11">While they made some modest improvement in operating expenses, they realized that you typically cannot cut enough costs to become profitable; you have to focus on not being wasteful.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">ATSi was expecting to make a profit in year 2, but instead they failed to implement the changes needed and had to fund a loss instead of having profit by following a three-pronged approach:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">They squeezed their cash down by $40,000.</li>
<li class="calibre11">They used that $40,000 to pay down their line of credit so the bank would not think the loan was uncollectible (because the bank would worry, since you cannot repay a loan when you have losses).</li>
<li class="calibre11">Instead of taking distributions, the owner made a capital contribution of $19,819.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">After reflecting on year 2, ATSi learned the following:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">A dLER of $3.25 would get them to breakeven, and $3.50 would get them to 10%.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-51" class="calibre4"></a>Their marketing spend may have missed the mark, but they would give it one more year at the same level and try to track more so they could correlate the results of their spending by channel.</li>
<li class="calibre11">They were out of funding resources, so any cash shortfall would have to come from personal funds or borrowing from the owner personally.</li>
<li class="calibre11">It would have been better to get profitable in year 1 rather than trying to grow out of a hole since they had limited access to funding for their launch capital.</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent1">ATSi is ready to move on to year 3 and put a foundation in place.</p>
<p class="noindent">Table 8.3 shows that ATSi is making progress! The key highlights of year 3 are as follows:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">It took the company until partway into the first quarter of year 3 to transition direct labor staff members who were ineffective. Then the company established a salary cap policy for hiring and raises that said no labor would be added unless dLER was $3.50 or better for that quarter. ATSi was fortunate that their revenues were consistent throughout the year, so they could see this on a quarterly basis. If their revenue had been seasonal, they would have needed to use a rolling 12 to control the salary cap.</li>
<li class="calibre11">They determined that a significant portion of their marketing spend was ineffective. You will see an adjustment in year 4.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Their operating expenses grew back to a similar level as in year 1. Trimming these costs is much like weeding a garden: it takes constant focus or they grow back; but this is not nearly as important as managing dLER.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-53" class="calibre4"></a>With only $25,000 in profit, there was not enough cash flow to meet the company’s obligations. The owner had to raise $105,482 through personal borrowing to help pay down the line of credit and keep the cash stable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="scl"><b class="calibre5">Progress in Years 4 through 7</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">The foundation was laid in year 3, so let’s look at ATSi’s successive years in table 8.4 and see their progress build.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">ATSi years 4 through 7</h3>

<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00000.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The highlights of year 4 are as follows:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-115" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">Using a dLER of $3.50 to control hiring and raises, ATSi was finally able to hit 10% net income and a leveraged ROIC of 99%, but they still needed to pay off their line of credit.</i></li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The biggest change in operating expenses was their marketing spend, which fell by $124,000</i>. As a result, their revenue increased at a higher rate than in year 3, which had a greater marketing spend. Marketing expenses should be effective, but the challenge is tracking and measuring that effectiveness. ATSi tended to keep customers for multiple years, and they had overapplied the lifetime value of a customer concept to justify some of their marketing spend. The lifetime value of a customer can be a valid concept if you have a lot of cash to burn until you scale, but ATSi did not. When funding is limited, you first have to get profitable with what you have, then decide if you want to gamble with your after-tax profits and use the launch capital ideas described in Chapter 6.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The owner finally took a full market-based wage in year 4 and did not have to take distributions from that point forward to fund personal living expenses.</i></li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The distributions in year 4 were used to pay off the personal funding sources the owner contributed during years 2 and 3. </i>Since those were not long-term structured sources, they had a higher repayment priority than the business debt, which did get reduced some.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">No taxes were paid on the business profits, since ATSi was still carrying forward losses from prior years, but every dollar of profit would be taxed from this point forward.</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-54" class="calibre4"></a>Things really started taking off in year 5. ATSi started to feel and see the benefits of their plan. Here are the highlights:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">With a dLER of no less that $3.50, you are still looking for the upper end of what is possible. </i>As you identify your brand standard and your team executes to that standard, you do not add labor until you have to. In year 5, ATSi set a new standard for what is possible, but sometimes their direct labor was functioning beyond capacity, or as we say, “running hot.” They knew they would need to add labor in the following year, but they could be patient and find the right new team members. ATSi found that a dLER of $3.50 gave them a steady state of operations and room to train new staff. If needed, they could temporarily run as high as $4.00, but that would not be sustainable for more than one year.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The mLER settled in at $5.00 or above. </i>This is usually the last metric to solidify, but it should remain constant or slightly improve from here. Until the shareholders are taking a full market wage, you cannot target the mLER rate. While dLER varies considerably from business to business, mLER seems to run from $3.50 to $4.00 for 10% profit performance, and it moves to $5.00 once you get above $5 million in revenue for the majority of businesses we see. ATSi was able to use an mLER of $5.00 as their salary cap for the management team from this point forward.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Facilities, payroll taxes, and other operating expenses had not changed drastically from year 1</i>. The costs from year 1 were really for the year 5 revenue support. These costs should scale relative to contribution margin from this point forward, with a slight lag in timing. They usually adjust one year after the next size level is attained.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-55" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">The company’s marketing effectiveness really improved, and they started to get a better feel of how to spend for impact. </i>By keeping the spend level the same as year 4, they were able to achieve 13% growth over that year and were poised to increase the spend, now that they had a better idea of what worked for the money invested.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The company profits soared, so they paid off their line of credit and had a company celebration! </i>Distributions were made only to cover taxes on profit that flowed through to the owner. They retained the rest of the cash to build their core capital target of two months of operating expenses in cash. For ATSi, that is $250,000 for one month and $500,000 for two months, so they ended the year almost at one month.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">ROIC soared to 147% with no leverage, but the company was still undercapitalized by one month of operating expenses. </i>The investment was finally starting to pay off!</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">ATSi’s success continued in year 6, and their profit climbed to 19%. The key highlights from year 6 are as follows:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Since their dLER ran above $4.00 in year 5, they took the pressure off by adding more employees, then the dLER dropped back to $3.76. </i>From here, the company needed to balance raises for their team against the cost of adding new personnel.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Operating expenses stayed in line with their operating ratios, and the additional marketing spend was a success in that it was proportional to the company’s growth.</i></li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Of the $765,000 in profit, about $500,000 was used for distributions</i>. That included $270,000 to cover taxes and $230,000 for an after-tax distribution to the owner. The <a id="calibre_link-113" class="calibre4"></a>company did not see any investment opportunities that would meet the minimum 50% ROIC standard, so they built wealth outside the business. It feels good when you get a profit distribution as a tangible reward for your strategy. The remaining profit was used to increase cash, get to 1.5 months of core capital, increase accounts receivable, and purchase some minor fixed assets.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">ROIC came in at 138%, which is not too shabby!</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Year 7 was the company’s best year ever, in terms of net income dollars and net income as a percentage to revenue. While the net results were outstanding, ATSi must stay mindful of certain trends to remain stable. Here are the highlights:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The dLER has fallen back to $3.49 because the company had to staff up quickly for a 20% growth year. </i>They expect dLER to fall back to $3.75 as the new team members get acclimated and fully trained. You can see that the dLER drop cost them 3% on contribution margin as a percentage to revenue. Also, part of the change was caused by increased wages for their existing team members so ATSi could stay competitive in a very tough labor market. The company will probably need to increase their prices soon to get dLER back to $3.75 because efficiency alone cannot overcome rising wages.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The mLER continues to rise, but ATSi will likely need to add more members to the management team as they cross the $5 million threshold and exit the black hole. </i>They will be able to add that labor and stay above their $5.00 mLER target.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The company’s marketing effectiveness continues to shine. </i>Their spend was held at about 6% to sales, and they added 20% in new revenue. It is imperative to track marketing effectiveness this way so you can give effective feedback to the person in charge of spending.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-56" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">Operating expenses continue to lag revenue growth, but those expenses typically take a year to respond. </i>Their percentage to revenue dropped significantly this year because the company had a big growth year, so they expect some of those costs to rise in the following year.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The profit was used for distributions of $753,286, which includes $364,700 for taxes and $388,586 to the owner as a profit distribution. </i>They also increased their cash by $237,569 to meet their two-month core capital target.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">ROIC stayed high, at 123%, and the company is fully capitalized. </i>Where can you get that kind of yield in the market?</li>
</ul>
<div class="box">
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Is Marketing to Blame?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">For as much as every entrepreneur wants an algorithm to tell them how much to spend on marketing, our experience across many industries shows that it is more art than science. The most effective method is to test, evaluate, and expand until the market resists.</p>
<p class="noindent">If your results are not as expected, marketing may not be the issue; it could be that your product, service, or customer service approach is not what the market wants.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">The ATSi case study exemplifies the kinds of transformations that we often get to experience with our clients. I am amazed at how often entrepreneurs make effective decisions when they have timely and understandable business data.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="calibre_link-84" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Key Data Points for Labor Productivity</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">There are only a handful of major data points you need to focus on when your data is structured so you can read it clearly. Here are a few more key takeaways from working with our clients on their labor productivity.</p>
<p class="scl"><b class="calibre5">LER Is Your Four-Minute Mile Barrier</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Back in the 1950s it was widely believed that no human could ever run a mile faster than four minutes. Then Roger Bannister did it in 1954 with the help of two runners who helped pace him. LER in business is like a world record; it exists to be beaten, and it serves as a pacing mechanism. When our clients monitor LER by quarter, month, week, or day, they have a greater chance to achieve their desired target. Once they reach a new level, it reminds them what is possible and points to the next mile marker.</p>
<p class="scl"><b class="calibre5">Focus on Labor Dollars, Not Bodies</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Whenever I hear an entrepreneur discuss revenue, profit, or any other measure per person, it makes me cringe. The last time I checked, no two people are the same, so a per-person metric to quantify output seems dehumanizing. I know it is not meant that way; it is just that people do not see the actual dollars they need to create a better measurement since most companies bury payroll information in their financial reports.</p>
<p class="scl"><b class="calibre5">Equitability, Not Equality</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">This might not be a popular thing to say, but assuming the playing field is level in the first place, pay equitability is more important than equal pay. With an equal pay concept, the business or the employee is avoiding measurement to compare the levels of output by person. Equitability means paying more to those who consistently produce more. The nice thing about equitable pay is that it motivates the business owner to keep paying people more as they produce more, and the company often provides on-the-<a id="calibre_link-85" class="calibre4"></a>job training to help employees achieve their best. It is the ultimate win/win scenario for employers and employees. In a highly competitive wage market, savvy businesses use this approach, rather than paying employees as little as they can, to keep the competition from stealing them away.</p>
<p class="noindent">One of my favorite behavioral economics researchers and authors is Adam Grant, who is a Wharton School professor and the bestselling author of <i class="calibre8">Give and Take</i>. He discussed the topic on his blog in a post about athlete pay on professional sports teams. He wrote, “Teams with unequal pay won fewer games when pay differences were not connected to performance. But they won more games when differences in pay were based on players’ contributions. Equity matters more than equality. Differences in pay aren’t a problem, as long as they’re fair. When players are paid less than teammates who aren’t performing any better, jealousy, resentful [<i class="calibre8">sic</i>], and discouragement often follow. When they’re paid less than teammates who deliver more value, they understand” (“Should Teammates Get Equal Pay?” July 18, 2014, retrieved from <a href="http://www.ethicalsystems.org/aggregator/sources/6" class="calibre4">https://www.ethicalsystems.org/aggregator/sources/6?page=2).</a></p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-367"><b class="calibre5">Individual versus Team Performance</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">In the ATSi case study earlier in this chapter, the company did not track hours by billable event. They are what I call a productized service business that charges a fixed price for each service. ATSi tracks teams of people who are responsible for each group of services, and that allowed them to identify some services that needed price increases and others that needed to be discontinued. It also allowed them to manage growth by team because, in terms of growth, certain services outpaced others. In a perfect world, we could track growth by person, but the team approach is valid.</p>

<div id="calibre_link-299" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-368"><b class="calibre5">Team Member Education</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">In the case study, ATSi invested heavily in educating their team members about gross margin, dLER, and contribution margin. <a id="calibre_link-203" class="calibre4"></a>Although the company did not disclose everything, they shared the company’s goals and progress toward contribution margin targets as each year progressed. They established recognition of achievement bonuses that were paid when key targets were met, but they were not large amounts&mdash;just enough to reinforce the importance of hitting a target. The key point is that the CEO assumed responsibility for leading the training to prove the company was committed to the concept and was willing to explain and defend the strategy.</p>
<p class="scl"><b class="calibre5">A-Player Grid</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">One of the favorite tools among my fellow Entrepreneurs’ Organization members for team identification and development is the A-player grid. This tool has been around for a long time, and I am not sure of its origin, but figure 8.1 is an example of how I use it with my clients.</p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00003.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>

<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">A-player grid.</span></i></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-88" class="calibre4"></a>The first time that I saw an A-player grid, it was a typical four-quadrant consultant box. Most of my Entrepreneurs’ Organization peers agree that culture, on the y-axis, is important enough to require that employees reach a level of 7 or higher. I always challenge my audiences to plot each of their team members on this graph. Very few people accept the challenge because they do not want to turn over that many people at once. Employees who fall in the bottom-left corner are easy for most of us to terminate quickly; those team members are low on culture and low on productivity. The employees in the upper-left quadrant are the lovable slackers. You like them, but they never get enough done to meet their productivity goals and are often found holding up the walls in the hall while talking to passersby. People in the bottom-right quadrant are the toughest to deal with; we call them the terrorists. They produce a lot but destroy your culture, and if you let them go it will cause a short-term loss. You wonder if they are truly committed to your culture or your profit.</p>

<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-370"><b class="calibre5">Accounting for Contractors</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">While I always encourage our clients to correctly classify workers as employees or contractors, some industries encounter situations that are not always clear. For LER purposes, we include a contractor in COGS if they are a legitimate business and the amount you pay allows them to make a profit as a business, not just get paid a wage. Even though you might upcharge your customer for what the contractor charges you, it is reflected in your gross margin; essentially, you compensate your direct labor for interfacing with the contractor.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you hire a contracted freelancer who essentially charges a market labor rate plus payroll taxes (25% to 35% markup), it is fine to classify the freelancer as direct labor. The key is to be consistent. Many of our clients have perfected a way to keep their committed labor at peak LER and use subcontract labor to the same or better contribution margin for overflow work. If you <a id="calibre_link-83" class="calibre4"></a>want to compare your contractor’s output to your team’s output, use contribution margin percentage.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-274" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-371"><b class="calibre5">Staffing Company Exception</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Over the years we have worked with several staffing company clients from various focused industries. Staffing companies work off very thin margins, compared to other service businesses, since they are essentially being paid to recruit employees, run their payroll, and replace them if the client does not like them. They do not manage the person. For this effort, they usually get a margin of 20% to 30%. Since that margin is so tight, we include payroll taxes in the margin calculation.</p>
<p class="noindent">These clients choose one of two approaches to view their data, which demonstrates the flexibility of our structure:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">For straight staffing agencies that just provide personnel, they include wages and payroll tax in COGS. Their recruiters and account managers are considered direct labor.</li>
<li class="calibre11">If an agency has travel or other out-of-pocket costs, they are considered pass-through costs and are reflected in COGS. The contracted employee and associated payroll tax goes into direct labor, and the recruiter and account manager go into management labor. If the agency does have pass-through costs and wants to account for them like companies who do not have these costs, they are flowed through the balance sheet as reimbursable costs since they effectively inflate the revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Either methodology works, as long as you consistently apply the approach you choose.</p>
<p class="scl"><a id="calibre_link-82" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Matching Labor to Demand</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">There are two key plays you can use to match your labor level to your sales demand: sell to the labor level that you commit to, or flex your labor level as your sales demand changes.</p>
<p class="noindent">A lot of clients tell us they flex their labor to demand, when in reality, their rolling 12 labor graph shows labor going up and gross margin going down. Not every industry is suited to flex labor without major pain. Some companies have tried remote workers with flexible schedules, or they look for part-time employees to match labor to demand.</p>
<p class="noindent">As an example, Starbucks considers a team member to be full time at 30 hours per week. A team member can be asked to work up to 40 hours, but they are guaranteed 30 hours in six shifts of 5 hours each. That gives Starbucks a labor flexibility of 25% with no overtime premium. They make sure to hire people who can live on 30 hours per week so managers are not pressured to schedule employees for extra hours, even if the company does not need that much labor. A key point here is that team members are scheduled in 5-hour shifts.</p>
<p class="noindent">In terms of performance, the ideal shift length for part-time workers is five hours because that is the maximum allowed before a meal break. Among our clients, we have seen that any time an employee takes a full meal break, there is a loss of productivity as the meal break approaches and a slow ramp-up after the break ends. I have yet to find a business that could mitigate this loss.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, for a full-time day worker, optimum productivity occurs in a 10-hour shift. This is the longest work day that does not cross over two meal periods. Several of our manufacturing clients have found that four 10-hour days gives them greater output than five 8-hour days. Their challenge is the same as faced <a id="calibre_link-93" class="calibre4"></a>by Starbucks: finding people who want to work on that schedule and possibly keeping an overlapping team in place. A few years ago I read that USAA, an insurance company, split their team in half and went to four-day, 10-hour shifts. Half of the team worked Monday through Thursday, and the other half worked Tuesday through Friday. I do not know if that innovative model is still in place. The only concern would be customer service coverage on Monday and Friday.</p>
<p class="noindent">Certain roles may not allow for 5- or 10-hour shifts, but many production environments are well-suited for this model. The downside is that this structure introduces cultural difficulties that you have to manage. Any time an employee is working when others are not, they think they are doing all the work.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-277" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-372"><b class="calibre5">Moneyball for Business</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">It is flattering when our clients refer to my LER concepts as Moneyball for business. Clearly there is more to Billy Beane’s statistical analysis that pulled the Oakland A’s out of the cellar and later helped the Red Sox win their first World Series in 86 years to finally overcome the curse of the Bambino! When you can get LER down to the team member who produced it, you start to have the ability to build your championship roster, just like a sports team does. You will see the productivity arc of your team as they progress, and you can start to identify who is in it for a championship run and who is in it for a season.</p>
<p class="noindent">Like all time and billing systems, the software our firm uses, Practice CS by Thomson Reuters, allows us to establish a standard billable rate by person. But Practice CS allows us to connect those billable hours to a client invoice, and it will write up or down everybody’s billable dollars to what made it to the invoice. Most simplistic time tracking systems will not do this critical step, so they do not allow you to determine actual billed value by employee. If you do not connect the ultimate value that <a id="calibre_link-197" class="calibre4"></a>made it to the invoice by employee, it would be like measuring quarterbacks against pass attempts, regardless of how many were completed and for how many yards.</p>
<p class="noindent">If your time keeping system can handle this allocation process, you have a huge advantage because you can measure true output. The process is not without subjectivity, however, because you can allocate write-offs against everyone who worked on a task, even though some individuals may not have caused the loss. We win together and fail together, and even though a system may allow for specific write-offs by person, every person should support team efficiency rather than being the one who shines and saves the day. From the data I get for our firm, it is obvious who the top performers are, even though they may share some writeoffs they are not responsible for.</p>
<p class="noindent">Tracking LER by person also helps when you mix contractors in with your employees. Our clients are often shocked when they see their lack of leverage when they use contractors, compared to keeping full-time employees busy. It is not uncommon for an employee who you utilize 50% of the time to give you a higher margin than a contractor. It pays to do the math.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-373"><b class="calibre5">Career Labor Efficiency Curve</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">One of my most requested slides after a presentation is the career labor efficiency curve. The graph looks at an employee and compares their labor output and compensation for each year across their career. Before we dig in, let’s look at baseball to introduce the concept.</p>
<p class="noindent">Baseball uses an output metric that I wish we had in business; it is called wins above replacement (WAR). Here is what Wikipedia says about WAR: “A player’s WAR value is claimed to be the number of additional wins his team has achieved above the <a id="calibre_link-215" class="calibre4"></a>number of expected team wins if that player were substituted with a replacement-level player: a player who may be added to the team for minimal cost and effort.” I am not endorsing the accuracy of the metric; but assuming it is a reasonable representation of output, Jason Varitek, retired catcher of the Boston Red Sox, is one of the best examples I could find (figure 8.2).</p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00004.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-295" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-374"><b class="calibre5">Figure 8.2</b></h2>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">WAR and compensation for Jason Varitek.</span></i></p>
<p class="noindent">The Boston Red Sox have long been my favorite team, even though I live in Alabama. As the Red Sox made their 2004 run to break through and finally win their first World Series in 86 years, Varitek was a key player and team leader. His WAR rose each year from 2001 to 2005, and you can see that he was getting steady pay increases. As a catcher, he had a tough job. Players at that position usually have shorter careers, and they rarely get long-term deals due to the high risk of injury.</p>
<p class="noindent">After winning the World Series in 2004, many of the key players, including Varitek, got raises and multi-year deals, since other teams were looking to draw them away in free agency. Varitek’s on-field performance declined due to some injuries, but the front office knew that his leadership on the team offset his declining batting average. Eventually, Varitek decided to refocus his efforts, <a id="calibre_link-156" class="calibre4"></a>so he retired and became part of the Red Sox front office with reduced pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though you probably do not have a World Series trophy, it is no different in your business. A key employee helps you achieve a significant level of attainment in your business, so you give them a big raise or bonuses, but the employee does not continue with the same output level. Look for an opportunity to change the person’s role and compensation, like the Red Sox did with Varitek, and keep a key leader around at the right amount of pay. Sometimes the employee will leave after entertaining offers from other companies. Or maybe they will find their second wind and their career takes off again. In other cases they discover that their skills have become outdated in a changing marketplace, and they have to either retool their skills or accept a different role.</p>

<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Career labor efficiency curve: Three zones.s</span></i></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-110" class="calibre4"></a>To reflect these changing dynamics, I break down the career labor efficiency curve into three segments: the training zone, the chasing zone, and the replacement zone (figure 8.3).</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-291" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-376"><b class="calibre5">Training Zone</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">When someone starts working for you, they rarely produce enough in the beginning to justify their pay. It could take days, weeks, months, or years for their productivity to exceed their pay, and this period is called the training zone. It is important to make the training zone as compressed as possible, but it also needs to be effective. Make sure the person knows they cannot stop improving when they produce more than they make, which I call the crossover point. This is just the beginning of the chase!</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-293" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-377"><b class="calibre5">Chasing Zone</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">When the employee hits the crossover point, they enter the chasing zone. This zone embraces the idea that, in the best compensation models, pay chases performance (not the other way around). The most tried-and-true way to maintain profitability is to have the employee prove they can produce before you increase their pay. However, if you are at risk for losing a key team member, you might have to pay before they perform. In that case, establish a new output expectation to justify the raise. If the employee resists the new expectation, you might need to let the other company draft them, and you can bring up the next player from the bench.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-294" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-378"><b class="calibre5">Replacement Zone</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">The toughest part of personnel management occurs in the replacement zone. The harsh reality is that we all reach a point when, after a long run of successful productivity, our pay exceeds our output. Larger companies can experiment with options like changing roles and adjusting pay. Smaller companies must act faster because they have only a few key producers. This is why <a id="calibre_link-157" class="calibre4"></a>we encourage companies to invest in systems and processes that measure team members’ output so you can help extend their career as their performance starts to wane. Also, you must be careful to not attribute lower margins to labor if you are not raising prices to keep up with inflation in your labor costs. When you face the data objectively, you have a much better chance of keeping your team productive longer and reducing drama when replacements are needed. My bet is there will always be something for capable people to do if you are willing to adapt.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">LER as a Tool for the Future</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">When I first created the principles and methodology of LER, I had no idea how big it would become. My team has witnessed its impact and the clarity it gives our clients, who now have a metric to match up to what they see in the business and what they cannot see when they are away from the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">I predict that LER will continue to gain popularity as technology starts to enhance team members’ roles in a labor-constricted economy. Who knows where it will go from there?</p>

<p class="sc"><i class="calibre8">Every entrepreneur needs to know whether the<br class="calibre9" />shiny object is a diamond or a distraction.</i></p>
<p class="center">&ndash; Greg Crabtree</p>
<p class="noindent1a">Now that you have seen your business model margins and LER for your business in total, it is time go 3D to see how each segment of your business performs. Most businesses will have more than one distinct product, service, division, or location in their business model. Traditional financial presentations leave a lot to be desired in understanding how each of these segments is performing. This lack of delineation in your data opens the door to an endless stream of excuses in management meetings on why the business missed its mark this month. With more precision in your reporting, you can put your finger on exactly what’s going right&mdash;and what needs to be cut.</p>
<p class="sca"><i class="calibre14">You must face the harsh reality that corporate<br class="calibre9" />costs need to be held accountable to the net<br class="calibre9" />operating income generated by the segments!</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The first big mistake accountants make in segment reporting is to try to produce a full P&amp;L for each segment by allocating out <a id="calibre_link-130" class="calibre4"></a>corporate or shared costs. As a young bank controller, I learned this lesson when I prepared the first ever branch profitability report for my bank. I was quite proud of it, until I showed it to the branch managers and they all protested, “Why did you allocate that to me? I don’t have anything to do with those costs!”</p>
<p class="noindent">After I thought about it, I realized that they were exactly correct. Why should their branch’s P&amp;L show anything that was not directly related to it? I modified the report to show only the actual operating expenses of each individual branch. It was corporate’s responsibility to manage the costs that were not directly associated with the branches. I also gave the branches cost-of-money credit for the deposits they generated that other branches loaned out. For the branches that loaned out more than they had in deposits, I charged them for the cost of money they used from the other branches. The managers agreed this was a more useful presentation, as it gave us a pattern of the most successful branches to try to replicate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ultimately, I learned that it is a useless exercise to allocate out corporate costs. I learned to hold corporate costs accountable to net operating income from the segments, because that income from all branches had to be high enough to cover the corporate overhead costs and make the target profit. Holding corporate costs accountable makes management uncomfortable sometimes, but facing that harsh reality is needed to build a great business.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since many businesses do not have a clean segment like a branch or location, I have developed principles for every business to define their segment reporting and take it as deep as is practical for analysis purposes.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-379"><b class="calibre5">Segment Reporting Concepts</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Segment profitability is pretty simple when you have locations or very distinct operating divisions. However, segment analysis <a id="calibre_link-57" class="calibre4"></a>can go much deeper than that. The key is to not get sucked into allocation hell trying to get to a corporate net income by segment. There are three levels you can dive down to in segment reporting: Gross Margin (Level 1), Contribution Margin (Level 2), and Net Operating Income for Segment (Level 3). When we first start working with a new client, many will only have Gross Margin data. As they see the benefits of tracking direct labor, we can get them to Level 2, Contribution Margin. Typically, most segments stop here unless you have a formal division or location structure. Any of the three levels can be useful, but the deeper you can go with accurate tracking of costs, the more insight you will have.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-308" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 title="**Table 9.1**, Segment reporting levels" class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-380"><b class="calibre5">Table 9.1</b></h2>
<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">Segment reporting levels</h3>

<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00001.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-58" class="calibre4"></a>As we have discussed, your operating expense structure is not that flexible, and I prefer to get any segment first to a gross margin number and then to a contribution margin number. If there are any operating expenses that would go away if that segment went away, it would be acceptable to identify those as “turn-off costs” and then get to a net operating income of segment&mdash;which would be defined as the amount of profit or loss that would disappear if that segment did not exist. It would not get allocations of overhead or other general supporting operating expenses that you would assume would remain. Your guiding principle of segment reporting is: if the revenue or expense turns on while we have this segment and turns off when it goes away, then treat that revenue or expense as a segment item.</p>
<p class="noindent">A segment can be anything that we can first get to gross margin. Then hopefully, we can connect direct labor to that gross margin and get down to a contribution margin. A common list of segments might include:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">By line of business</li>
<li class="calibre11">By customer</li>
<li class="calibre11">By division</li>
<li class="calibre11">By location</li>
<li class="calibre11">By team</li>
<li class="calibre11">By job or contract</li>
<li class="calibre11">By employee</li>
<li class="calibre11">Any other activity that can be tracked by revenue, COGS, and direct labor</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-59" class="calibre4"></a>Segments that should have similar margin and LER would be jobs, contracts, and customers. For these, your best performers will be obvious and you should work to bring the rest up to that level. Lines of business can have a dramatic difference in performance. Make sure to stay focused on margin, not revenue. For lines of business that have different margin percentages, you can use a return-on-investment rate to determine which line is best by taking segment profit divided by all of the trade capital and infrastructure capital required for that activity to get a return on investment for that segment.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">How to Analyze Segment Data</b></p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-0" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-381"><b class="calibre5">Location Segments</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Let’s start with a simple example of a multi-location retail business. In table 9.2, we have a complete P&amp;L for store-specific income and expenses. To best compare the stores, the leading numbers of the group for each major criterion is highlighted in green. The far right column represents what a theoretical store could do if it optimized each of the best characteristics.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-24" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 title="**Table 9.2**, Initial location segment summary" class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-382"><b class="calibre5">Table 9.2</b></h2>
<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">Initial location segment summary</h3>

<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00032.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-60" class="calibre4"></a>Take note that the store with the most revenue does not have all of the best characteristics. Store 2 produced the largest dollar amount of store profit, but it was not as efficient as Store 1. Store 1 sold at a higher gross margin and had lower operating costs. In retail, it is difficult to match operating expenses by store, but margin output has to compensate for a store that costs more to operate. Store 3 seems to do the best with managing labor, so you would look at what they are doing differently from the other stores.</p>
<p class="noindent">Based on the P&amp;L, Store 2 would still be the rooster crowing about how good they are, since profit dollars are all that matter. Right? But P&amp;L’s do not tell the whole story&mdash;so let’s add the return-on-investment analysis to the bottom for table 9.3 and look at inventory by location and buildout costs by location.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-25" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-383"><b class="calibre5">Table 9.3</b></h2>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Location segment summary with ROI analysis</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00030.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-131" class="calibre4"></a>Now we see the true story! Store 4 is the one that makes us the best return on our investment. Store 4 sells less because they have taken a focused inventory approach to only stock the inventory that has good margin. It turns five times a year instead of the shotgun inventory approach Store 2 is using to stock more and see what sells. Which store do you think is more likely to wake up one day and realize they need to write-down inventory that will never sell? Store 2 is at a higher risk of developing stale inventory that you will eventually have to dump.</p>
<p class="noindent">Store 4 also accomplished a lower buildout cost by having the landlord handle some renovation as part of their rent. The company also looked for retail space that was more ready to fit. Lower inventory and buildout all count to ROIC, and efficient use of capital allows for more stores to be opened. I would also think there are many more potential locations that would support $850K in revenue than $1.3M. This is a great example of why you cannot rely on the P&amp;L alone in your analysis of best segment activity.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-73" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-384"><b class="calibre5">Division Segments</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">To explain division segments, we will use an example company that performs installation and maintenance of equipment and requires field services labor. This example, showin in table 9.4, segregates activity into projects, recurring maintenance contracts, and new construction projects. Even though they are using the same skill set for each area, the business models are quite different.</p>
<p class="noindent">The project work produces the most revenue, but you can see the recurring maintenance work yields the best rate of contribution margin. Before this company broke out the activity, they thought their margins were the same for all activities. They were also surprised at how low the margin was on the new construction segment.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-61" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 9.4</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Initial division segment summary</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00022.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent">To improve performance, they looked at LER by project and determined which projects were below acceptable LER. They determined it was a blend of poor pricing habits and poor execution. After addressing those issues, they were able to bring up contribution margin percentage for projects by 6%, which flowed to the bottom line. Not much improvement was needed on the recurring segment, just to continue growing it and not let margin and LER decline in ways that were preventable. They realized that construction was not a good segment for them if they wanted to aggressively grow, so they assigned a small amount of staff resources to choose only those construction projects that would lead to recurring work or other project work.</p>
<p class="noindent">To look deeper, let’s now add an analysis of their segment investment to the view in table 9.5. In this scenario, I have shown only trade capital as the investment, since their infrastructure capital would be assumed to be used evenly across all activities and mostly consists of service vehicles.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-62" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 9.5</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Division segment summary with ROI analysis</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00011.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent">This is where you really see why private equity values companies with recurring revenue. Since there is a service agreement, you are always billing in advance, with only a few slow-paying customers. This is why the recurring AR days outstanding is only 5 days, where it is 45 days for projects and 75 days for construction. There are tactics you can employ to try to lower the days in the other activities, but you are not likely to get either to equal the speed of payment from the recurring work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since I am basing the return calculation on a margin number, I chose to express it a multiplier rather than a percentage, but either way will work. It is clear that their project work is far better than their construction work. You can also see the significant improvement in the return on the projects, once they improved the LER from 2.22 to 2.84. That slight increase in labor productivity more than doubled the return on trade capital, from 3.57 to 7.89.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-191" class="calibre4"></a>Now that they have optimized each activity, they can be more effective at scaling if the market is there. If scaling requires tradeoff decisions of price or terms, they have the tools to evaluate the impact of both.</p>

<div id="calibre_link-74" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-385"><b class="calibre5">Service Team Segments</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">More than any other business model, service business models benefit from LER tracking by person or team. What you bill the customer is the pure output of the labor cost to provide that service. This is why timekeeping is so important, so you can evaluate the “cost” to provide the service. Most people make the error of thinking that you track time in order to bill for your time. Unfortunately, billing by the hour ultimately causes you to either give away your expertise or charge for your ignorance. The goal is to maximize the value of your labor whenever the market allows, by using fixed-price billing methods and then managing the labor to the least cost to deliver the service.</p>
<p class="noindent">The case study below is adapted from a service company that used similar labor for all three service teams, but used different approaches to sell and manage the work. We have found the concepts in the case study to apply to any service industry (legal, accounting, marketing, IT, engineering or industrial). However, LER by industry can vary dramatically, so do not use these rates as benchmarks. You must study your own industry and company to develop your own targets.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s meet the teams. Each exemplifies a distinct billing model.</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Hourly Billed Project Services (“Project”). </i>This is the most common business model in the services world. Many companies have survived a long time using this approach. Yet, in a tight labor market, it is starting to show why it has deficiencies. Common characteristics are:
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-138" class="calibre4"></a>Services are billed by the hour or by soft estimate to customer. Rarely will a job not have a write-down of time, and there is no opportunity for a write-up.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Bill rates can either be a common rate for anybody who works it or vary by skill level. My team and I are not fans of the single rate approach, since you theoretically can never work up rate, you can only work down rate.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Projects are loosely scheduled as to deadlines, but workers do not calendar out tasks. Essentially, the whole team is working from a “to do” list.</li>
<li class="calibre11">There may be a master schedule of expected project completion but little to no project status vision. If they keep time, you may have total time spent, but snot likely by task or estimate of time to complete. If you don’t track time, you are totally blind.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The process depends on a team of self-managed staff. This is nice to have and is more common in a soft labor market when more people are available to build your team. In a tight labor market, it is hard to find that skill set, and it takes time, dollars, and turnover to build those team members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Hourly Billed Scheduled Services (“Scheduled”). </i>This is a common model in the home services industries, but we see it starting to be applied in other service areas with success. Common characteristics are:
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11">Billing is generally still done by the hour or by rate sheet value for a task, but is not as prone to writedown for hourly billing. I recommend billing every two weeks and no less frequently than monthly.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-136" class="calibre4"></a>All services are managed through a calendar system to put the task on the calendar of the team members. This allows for vision of capacity and gives each team member a definite production target. The calendar has to allow for project shift and overruns, as well as leaving room for high value tasks that randomly come up.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The calendar system requires a coordinator to oversee the team calendar and pull forward or push out tasks as demand changes. It becomes pretty obvious very quickly who can work to a schedule and who either constantly works late to catch up or is just always missing schedules.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The minimum schedule would be always two weeks out, but longer is better if you have recurring tasks. This is very similar to the two-week-sprint cycle in Agile programming concepts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Fixed-Price Productized Services (“Fixed Price”)</i>. Niche segments of every industry have the service providers that found a way to bill on a fixed-price basis and control the scope of the engagement. The challenge has been to bring that approach to the broader market. This approach is more common with a non-commodity service, but we are seeing it applied with success anytime the customer prefers a fixed price and you can manage scope and create clear points of when change orders apply. Common characteristics are:
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11">You have created a process that gives you an advantage over your competition to some or all of your service with less cost than the market. Billing <a id="calibre_link-137" class="calibre4"></a>for the value of the service and not your time allows you to gain the margin you deserve.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Customers prefer a fixed price for this service instead of hourly. Fixed price is like buying an extended warranty; sometimes it makes sense, and sometimes it does not. Fixed price that is presented as a good value proposition builds pricing trust quicker than an hourly method. Most entrepreneurs tell me they hate being billed by the hour if they do not have an idea of how much time it would take.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Project quoting is faster, since you can establish common pricing for repeatable services. Customers love the ability to get a quote quickly.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Your staff has a clear idea of what to perform to, and any gains accrue to them as higher performance.</li>
<li class="calibre11">You still need to track time for cost accounting purposes. Our preferred accountability is to assign a market billing rate per person, relative to their value to the market and their salary. You multiply each person’s market rate by their hours to get what you would have charged by the hour for the project. Then you write up or down the project and allocate the billing adjustment to each person. Sophisticated billing systems will do this for you, and we have devised offline methods to create that data when the system is lacking capability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">So let’s look at the numbers for our three teams; see table 9.6.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-132" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 9.6</b></p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="calibre_link-140" class="calibre">
<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-386"><b class="calibre5">Initial service segment summary</b></h2>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00027.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent">You can see in table 9.6 that the billed hours before write-offs show that the Project team is putting in the hours! Most businesses would consider them the key driver of their business. But in the world I live in, it is your output and your effectiveness that matter (see table 9.7).</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-133" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 9.7</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Service segment summary with write-offs</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00014.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent">After we look at write-offs in table 9.7, you can see that the project revenue dropped in significance to the total. In our experience in dealing with service businesses, this is about as far as they take their analysis, other than net revenues by customer. Let’s take the analysis to the next level! See table 9.8.</p>
<p class="text1a">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8">Service segment summary with LE</i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00017.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Since we can attach the labor by team to the net revenues, we now know the margin by team that tells true story in table 9.8. Margin in this example would also be the same as contribution margin, since there is no cost of goods sold in this example, just labor.</p>
<p class="noindent">In year 3, the fixed price team produces the most margin. They have fewer write-offs than the projects team, and their labor consistently produces at a higher LER. This is an excellent example of how taking these extra steps to analyze performance can prevent you from making the mistake of pushing the least profitable service just because it is the biggest top line.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-192" class="calibre4"></a>A robust system would also allow you to know this information by customer, and even by employee. You have to interpret that information in context, but it is invaluable to have. If you know LER by customer, you can establish a minimum expected target, and any relationship that falls below the minimum is reviewed. You should always review first if it is your performance or oneoff issues that were unforeseen. Otherwise, you would choose to re-price or re-scope for future work, or disengage from the customer. You would also review the “unforeseen” issues and improve your ability to spot those on future projects.</p>
<p class="noindent">A couple of insights from this data:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Project LER is declining, indicating either pricing issues or project management issues. </i>In this data set, pricing was to market so the decline was due purely to work management and training.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Scheduled LER is stable, yet customer LER for them indicated that a higher LER is attainable with the right mix of staff skill levels. </i>The main issue pulling down their LER is senior staff backfilling on lower-rate projects. While their team spirit is admirable, you can quantify the lost margin by not having the right staff at each service level.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Fixed price LER is stable, but customer LER data shows an opportunity to push it up with full utilization of the team.</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Since we now have this framework, it is easy to do capacity forecasting by team, should you get to the correct LER, as shown in table 9.9.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="calibre_link-134" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 9.9</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8">Service segment summary with forecasting</i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="images/00002.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-135" class="calibre4"></a>By identifying the potential LER for each team, you can back into targeted performance.</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Projects have the greatest potential capacity to improve.</i> It is possible that by adopting the calendar approach to scheduling, they would be able to match the scheduled team in productivity and exceed it in some cases for noncommodity projects.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The other two teams need minor improvements, but this supports our idea that it is better to get margin and LER right before you try to aggressively grow.</i></li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Notice that the fixed-price team gets 10% higher margin even after optimization. </i>While this may not always be the case, this is a good target to aim for and beat when you can. It still requires managing the team resources, but we see this technique fitting in with team behavior better than leaving it up to each person to schedule their tasks. Everybody has the intention of working to their best, but the actions taken without some management nudging rarely happen.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Segment analysis is the power tool for all growing businesses, and this concept is just as relevant for a $1 million business as it is for a $1 billion business. This approach also allows you to share data with a segment leader and not get into costs or revenues they have no control over. While I am a fan of open book management, not every business has laid the groundwork to share data. Using segment data can be a baby step towards more data sharing with your team, and helping them understand the direction in which you want to lead them.</p>

<p class="sc"><i class="calibre8">A budget is a license to spend; a forecast is a<br class="calibre9" />license to make money by spending only on<br class="calibre9" />things that add value beyond their cost.</i></p>
<p class="center">&ndash; Greg Crabtree</p>
<p class="noindent1a">Let’s take a poll: Who wants to live or work under a budget? Even if you raised your hand, I bet you are using the wrong word to describe what you mean. Assuming everyone agrees that we want the best possible financial outcome and no one is telling a story to justify their actions, the best approach is what I call value-based spending. You spend a dollar to recover the dollar you spent plus some multiplier above that.</p>
<p class="noindent">My heartburn about budgeting comes from years of experience seeing budgets gone bad. Budgeting is a license to spend, whereas plans and forecasts are licenses to make money. Forecasts that assume all things will work perfectly usually fail. Like our team says, we always make money on the spreadsheet. You must learn to be an accurate forecaster, like Jack Stack and the Great Game of Business people stress, or your only option is to live under a cost-constraint budget.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-214" class="calibre4"></a>Since most budgets are developed on a year-to-year basis, a budget mentality is not flexible enough for midyear corrections. If you are significantly off budget in the first quarter, you will naturally disconnect from the budget and sacrifice performance for the rest of the year, until the next budgeting cycle. You could be on target with your spending for operating expenses but off budget for revenue and margin. If you stick to your budget, you will spend your way down the bankruptcy path until it is too late to correct your course.</p>
<p class="noindent">We see this play out every day in government and large corporate settings. Those organizations do not trust their management to make course corrections, and the red tape to change direction is discouraging. Spending continues as planned, regardless of receipts taken in.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Base Your Spending on Value Received</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">To base spending on value received sounds great in theory, but as a practical matter it does require some process parameters to be in place, as my experience suggests.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a 26-year-old CPA, I had just been hired away from my first job to be the controller, and eventually the VP of operations, of a $140 million local bank. Even though I had audited banks, I did not have management experience. I was good with numbers, so I used that strength to question the status quo and make suggestions for improvement. I also found that it was far more effective to bring my ideas up with the CEO directly than to introduce them in a committee.</p>
<p class="noindent">The CEO was an experienced banker, and we connected quickly. He was very busy, so I had to choose strategic times to present my new ideas. I observed that he often came in to the bank on Sunday afternoons to clear his mail, and he would walk through <a id="calibre_link-107" class="calibre4"></a>the bank from the fifth floor to the first just to see if anyone was around. When he came through the third floor where my office was, I had my next idea ready for him. Most of the time it took five minutes or less for me to present my idea because I had learned what he wanted to know before he would approve an action that was not part of the original annual plan. This was also one of the best times for me to learn from him, since nobody was around; he trusted me to keep things confidential and would speak freely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before long, my fellow VPs (who were twice my age and had three times as much experience) were grumbling that I got special treatment because all my initiatives were green-lighted, and they struggled to get their ideas approved. I defended myself by saying I did not get what <i class="calibre8">I </i>wanted&mdash;I got what <i class="calibre8">he </i>wanted. I learned to listen to him and had answers ready for the questions I had learned to anticipate.</p>
<p class="sca"><i class="calibre14">The ability to look critically at a problem and<br class="calibre9" />consider the needs of all stakeholders is a<br class="calibre9" />foundational principle of value-based spending.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The ability to look critically at a problem and consider the needs of all stakeholders is a foundational principle of value-based spending. You must take into account everyone who is impacted by an increase or a cut. Your ability to anticipate the impact and have answers before you present is key to building the trust of the team and business leaders.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Key Areas in a Spending Plan</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">To devise a spending plan, you can create revenue and cost buckets to help guide your analysis. Here are the key areas you need to address for each choice:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-63" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">Revenue. </i>Does this spend help generate enough revenue, less cost of goods and labor, to cover the expenditure? The key mistake people make is to count revenue against the cost instead of against the net margin after cost of goods sold and labor.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Cost of goods or services. </i>Does this spend lower the cost of goods or services so the gross margin is higher than the proposed increase in spending?</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Direct labor. </i>Does this increased spend help make the direct labor more efficient, or does it reduce the direct labor by more than the amount spent? The breakout businesses we work with find a way to get more gross margin for every labor dollar spent. Sometimes this is accomplished by investing in technology, and sometimes by getting rid of ineffective technology and going old school! This is when your direct labor efficiency ratio helps you set a productivity target for the next direct labor employee.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Operating expenses. </i>Does this increased spend cause another cost to go down, or does a spending cut prevent another cost from rising to the same level or higher?</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Culture/brand. </i>Is this spend necessary to maintain the stated culture or brand? If we do not spend on this item, would it violate what we say about our company? This is the toughest answer to quantify, but your team has to reach an agreement and commit to it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="calibre1">
<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_link-387"><b class="calibre5">Evaluate Normal Ongoing Operations</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">For recurring or normal operations, the best approach is to question each cost decision as it is presented and ask this value question: are we still getting value from this item? If not, either <a id="calibre_link-209" class="calibre4"></a>stop it and see if anyone misses it, or bring it up for review by the next-higher management level and anticipate what answers will be needed, as in my banking story earlier in this chapter. The best review of normal operating expenses can be done by looking at rolling 12 trends for these groups of large expenses:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Facilities</li>
<li class="calibre11">Marketing</li>
<li class="calibre11">Other operating expenses (catchall bucket)</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">When you see a rolling 12 trend that looks odd, drill down into the line item costs.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here are a few tricks of the trade that work well:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Credit card charges. </i>Make sure to record credit card charges in detail. It is best to download them into your accounting system so you have the vendor name for each charge.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Vendor summary. </i>Run a quarterly report of your total spend by vendor, and rank them from largest to smallest. It is amazing how many times this causes overspending to pop out. A traditional profit and loss statement will not highlight this problem.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Recurring credit card and Automated Clearing House (ACH) charges. </i>Watch for recurring bills, credit card charges, and ACH charges for things that are no longer being used. This is the reason your gym wants you to pay monthly and forget about coming! Credit card companies have reports that list recurring charges and anticipated upcoming charges. If you do not have your account set to send you those reports, go to the company’s website and turn them on. Also turn on email notifications for merchant credits so you can be sure they actually credit you after you cancel an order.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-199" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">Chart of accounts. </i>Less is more, so do not create insignificant accounts. When you overdo it, your reports will be too noisy and you will not notice all those fine details. As a general rule, you do not need a general ledger account for an item that costs $1,000 or less in a year&mdash;I could even live with a $5,000 threshold. Current accounting software can drill down to the details and generate other reports, so a long chart of accounts is no longer necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">As a rule of thumb for most business models, if I add a dollar of operating expense to increase productivity (other than labor), I generally want it to create $2 of revenue. Marketing expenses depend on each business. Separate expenditures for branding and general awareness marketing from expenditures for transactional marketing, such as search engine optimization, AdWords, and so forth.</p>
<p class="noindent">Thinking about value-based spending will help you avoid the pitfalls of a budgeting mindset. It can lead to a more adaptive approach to help you trim costs in a tight market and scale up when the market is hot.</p>
