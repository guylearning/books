<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_3"><b class="calibre5">Build to Sell</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Build to sell is the rarest value play. It can work, but it leaves a big crater when it fails. The most common example of this strategy is in software development, but we have also seen it used in harvest to premium sale models when the entrepreneur is great at getting a business off the ground but gets bored running it. In those cases, their strategy is to max out the reinvestment of aftertax profits and apply internal leverage to spur growth to an optimum sale point.</p>
<p class="noindent">In software development, you typically start with a minimum viable product and get some customers to provide market validation and feedback on needed enhancements. It is usually at this point when you decide to either attract outside capital or pass on outside investors if you can generate enough internal profits to fund development.</p>
<p class="noindent">Regardless of the industry, the critical piece is being sure the market values what you are building. My experience with a client tells a cautionary tale. The client had 45 stores in the retail outlet sector. The CEO (who was not the owner) and I had developed a maximum profit and value plan that said to hold growth at 45 stores, which was the maximum capacity of their central warehouse. The plan was to close the five worst-performing stores each year and open five new stores in more promising markets. Given the structure of outlet mall leases for their store <a id="page17" class="calibre4"></a>size, it was inexpensive to open a new store, rents were usually based on percentage of sales, and there was minimal cost to get out of a lease. The CEO and I agreed that in their niche there were probably not many more than 45 good store locations due to customer demand.</p>
<p class="noindent">The owner, on the other hand, came from a real estate background and always thought bigger was better and wanted to open more stores. The CEO and I explained that we did not think the market would support more than 45 store locations, their warehouse did not have the capacity to serve more stores than that, and, given that the owner liked to deplete all the cash after the Christmas sale season (which led to lean summers), the company did not have the capital to carry more stores. But the owner prevailed and gave the full-steam-ahead order to expand to 75 stores.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is where Ernest Hemingway comes in. In his book <i class="calibre8">The Sun</i> <i class="calibre8">Also Rises </i>there are two characters who have this discussion:</p>
<p class="bk">“How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked.</p>
<p class="bk">“Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.”</p>
<p class="noindent">I thank Pascal Finette at Singularity University for sharing this quote in a keynote address he gave at the EO San Francisco University in 2018. As soon as I heard the quote, it took me back to this experience. It is amazing how long a person can hang on even though a business is dead. It was not my business, but as an advisor I hated to witness the death march, waiting for one final event to push it over the edge.</p>
<p class="noindent">There will never be a premium sale in this type of situation, so if your business is gradually getting in trouble, seriously evaluate your realistic options so fate does not suddenly overcome you.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="page18" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Examples of the Three Value Plays</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">To put these ideas in context, table 2.1 shows examples of the run to harvest, harvest to premium sale, and build to sell value plays. These examples are based on compiled client data (not a single client). The table is followed by discussions of each example to help you recognize which model your business uses and ensure your strategy aligns with your type of value play.</p>
