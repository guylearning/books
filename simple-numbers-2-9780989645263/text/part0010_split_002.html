<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_1"><b class="calibre5">Simple Numbers Analysis</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">The principles of our Simple Numbers analysis and presentation are as follows:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Every month ends a 12-month accounting cycle</i>. The ending month does not matter; the data is just as meaningful for any given 12 months. Rolling 12 data is the best form of financial truth for profit-and-loss presentations. It eliminates every excuse because it includes an entire year—all holidays, all four calendar seasons, and all business cycle seasons.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">It reveals behavioral economics. </i>There have been studies on how people use annual and monthly data to make key decisions. The results show that control groups who used only annual data to make buy and sell decisions for stock portfolios traded less frequently and had a higher yield than the group that traded only with monthly information. A month is a horrible unit of time to base decisions on. Accounting processes struggle to effectively report on monthly data, no matter how skilled your finance team is. No months are equal, but all 12-month periods are equal.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Our Simple Numbers summary view is robust and serves clients in all industries for the following reasons:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page88" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">It does not mix labor with cost of goods sold, so gross margin can be used as the true economic top line of the business. </i>Essentially, cost of goods sold are pass-through costs that flow outside your business. They serve only to inflate revenue.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Labor efficiency is clearly defined. </i>Because direct labor and management labor are isolated, rather than mixed with other costs, we can see productivity relationships to measure labor <i class="calibre8">output</i>, not minimize labor as a cost unless it is nonproductive. The addition of productive labor grows a business. Direct labor is held responsible against gross margin, while management labor is held responsible against contribution margin. I will discuss labor efficiency in Chapter 8.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Allocations are eliminated. </i>I am not a fan of allocations in the overall view of financials. I can see that it is necessary in segment reporting to spread certain shared revenue and costs, but I want to show labor that is not loaded for payroll taxes and benefits, nor do I want operating expenses (or overhead) allocated to cost of goods sold or labor. The omission of allocations saves my team time because they do not have to make the adjustments.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">It includes an output number called contribution margin that is the critical number in a business model. </i>My experience with modeling hundreds of businesses has shown that if I know contribution margin dollars, I can model up to revenue and down to net income. It also adds an additional benefit to share with your team. Since it is based on gross wages and gross margin, your team can <a id="page89" class="calibre4"></a>easily grasp the output of labor concept. They may not like it if their output measure is poor, but you have to address the truth to make improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The Simple Numbers summary has multiple views to further expand its usefulness. Unfortunately, these views can be generated only in spreadsheets unless you have a good coder or an accounting system with a robust reporting package. Even though these views are simple templates in our spreadsheet models, accounting systems have not made it easy for companies to reproduce them.</p>
<p class="noindent">The views in our Simple Numbers summary are as follows:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Year over year. </i>We start with rolling 12, then move to rolling 3, then finally show monthly. For shorter-term information, I always prefer rolling 3 over monthly.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Last 3 months. </i>Once again, we start with rolling 12. If you look at rolling 12 for the past three months and see it going up every month, real growth is taking place. Conversely, if it is falling, it is a major red flag that needs to be addressed quickly. After rolling 12, we look at rolling 3 and then monthly. The idea is to look at the longest data set first, work our way to the shortest, and not overreact to short-term data.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Year to date. </i>The year-to-date view is good only for estimating taxes. Otherwise, it is an invalid time period for analysis. My own company is a good example. In the year-to-date view we look great through October, then fall off the rest of the year. Most companies lose their butt in the last two months of the year, but we do not look at it that way in our own firm. We always try to beat last year’s November and December, and that always makes our rolling 12 go up!</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent1">The example described here is adapted example data that occurred live on a consulting call. We did the analysis on the fly to provide the client with financial clarity about their ongoing operations and to set launch capital spending targets, which are embedded in the operating data.</p>
<p class="noindent">The call started by looking at the company’s rolling-12 performance at the end of September over the past three years (table 6.5).</p>
