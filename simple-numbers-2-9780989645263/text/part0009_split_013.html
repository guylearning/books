<p class="noindent1">In the Make Stuff model in table 5.2, you can see that trade capital includes accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable. This model works for cash flow because vendors are willing to carry terms on inventory, so the company does not have to pay for inventory until it is used. Many manufacturing companies also have work in progress if the item they make has stages to its completion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Notice that the trade capital percentage to revenue is 12.30% and the profit percentage to revenue is 13.30%. This means the company essentially breaks even for cash flow on growth. If they decide to accept a lower percentage of profit to grow, say 10%, <a id="page71" class="calibre4"></a>they would grow in a cash-negative cycle that would limit their growth potential. The only thing they could do then would be to use the base camp approach to growth that I described earlierâ€” use only their existing cash plus line of credit, wait for their cash to catch up and build, then grow again.</p>
