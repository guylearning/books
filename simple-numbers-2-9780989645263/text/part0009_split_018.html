<p class="noindent1">Earlier in this chapter we formed a defining question: what is the ROIC for each business model? We can see in table 5.2 that the Make Stuff, Sell Stuff, and Do Stuff models have a similar ROIC, but the Sell Stuff (distribution) model wins by a nose! However, the Make Stuff (manufacturing) model has the least amount of volatility if any of the trade capital items shift toward the negative (such as if customers take longer to pay or vendors require payment sooner). And, as we saw in the discussion of capital signature for a services business, the Do Stuff (services) model comes in last in ROIC.</p>
<p class="noindent">Does this mean that the Sell Stuff model is the winner? On paper, the answer is yes. But, like most things in life, it depends. Regardless of which type of business you have, a solid understanding of three business models, the types of capital, and your capital signature will help you succeed and make your model best in class.</p>
