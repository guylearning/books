<p class="noindent1">While the “Do Stuff” business in table 5.1 has a nice profit in dollars, it is the hardest to scale because there is very little COGS <a id="page60" class="calibre4"></a>pass-through; it includes only subcontractors and materials. In this case, a subcontractor is a person or a company that performs a portion of the service at a rate of 130% of, or more than, what you would pay one of your employees to do the work. If you have freelancers or use a staffing company to provide direct labor, they should be shown as direct labor. Once the rate charged by a subcontractor exceeds 130%, you are essentially leaving enough margin in what you are paying to require some management oversight, and those costs should be accounted for as a passthrough in COGS.</p>
<p class="noindent">A services business generally has to get significantly more gross margin (and revenue!) to match the net income as percentage to gross margin of the other business types. Operating expenses as percentage to sales tends to be significantly higher than the other models. All of this leads to an underwhelming net income as percentage to gross margin, as compared to the other two business types. I have some services clients that can get to 20% or higher net income as percentage to sales, but they struggle to maintain it, and they struggle even more to scale it. There are only so many customers who will pay the kind of prices that produce that much profit.</p>
<p class="noindent">The thing you need to know is which of these business models you would rather have. What defining question does the data need to answer?</p>
