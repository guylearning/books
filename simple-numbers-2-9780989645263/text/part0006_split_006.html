<p class="noindent1">Sometimes a business is a pain to its competitors, and the competitors want that business to go away because its new mousetrap is better. If they cannot compete with the better mousetrap, they might pay a kingâ€™s ransom to make the business go away. This is not uncommon in disruptive industries when the new kid on the block starts to gain market share and the buyer would have to cannibalize their existing margins to compete. It is better to buy them quick before they get too big. I have seen companies get 10 times their <i class="calibre8">revenue </i>just to go away.</p>
<p class="scl"><b class="calibre5">Software as a Service and Recurring Revenue</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Software as a service (SaaS) companies and other companies with a strong recurring revenue model are the darlings of the premium business value marketplace. Despite the glory, beware of the traps. I will cover this in more detail in Chapter 6 when I discuss reinvesting in your business concepts. The common belief is to throw all your profits (and possibly outside capital) at growing this type of business as fast as you can. I agree with the idea of rapid growth, but only if you know what actually works to grow your business.</p>
<p class="noindent">I have clients who continually invest in advancing their software (when is a developer ever done with the software?) and spend considerable sums for marketing. Both are noble activities, but more discipline is needed to spend money where it works, not to spend just because you think that is what you are supposed to do.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page47" class="calibre4"></a>When possible, I like the controlled experiment process for both software development and marketing. You spend a small amount to prove your concept before you throw a lot of money at it to see if it sticks. It is not a sin to be profitable and have an SaaS or recurring-revenue business.</p>
<p class="noindent">These types of companies like to talk about the lifetime value of a customer. Although it is a nice argument in theory, the ability to measure this value going forward is a shot in the dark. I have heard some pretty lame arguments by marketing directors who like to use this thinking to justify their budget at a higher and higher customer acquisition cost. As a case in point, Google dynamically increases the price of your key search term as you add content that drives demand for it; in essence, they make you bid against your own success.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to build your business on recurring revenue or add recurring revenue to your existing business model, focus on market needs that truly fit that model with long-term customers. Trying to force a traditional business activity into a recurring revenue model just to get a higher multiple for a sale does not work if it makes you less profitable on an ongoing basis.</p>
