<p class="noindent1">The company in the “Make Stuff” column of table 5.1 is ultimately a $2.6 million manufacturing business. When you think about it, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is just a passthrough. If a customer wanted to use all their manufacturing capacity and said they would buy all the materials and supplies for everything the company makes, and if they asked the company for a manufacturing services quote, the price should be $2.6 million (all things being equal).</p>
<p class="noindent">The company might quote a lower price because the customer would be taking all the risk on materials and supplies, but I would encourage them not to do that since none of their operating costs would change. What does change is the amount of inventory they would need to carry. They might be able to lower the price some, depending on how much less capital they need to deploy. But hold that thought; we will evaluate it when we look at the Sell Stuff model.</p>
