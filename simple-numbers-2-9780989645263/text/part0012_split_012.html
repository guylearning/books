<p class="noindent1">One of my most requested slides after a presentation is the career labor efficiency curve. The graph looks at an employee and compares their labor output and compensation for each year across their career. Before we dig in, let’s look at baseball to introduce the concept.</p>
<p class="noindent">Baseball uses an output metric that I wish we had in business; it is called wins above replacement (WAR). Here is what Wikipedia says about WAR: “A player’s WAR value is claimed to be the number of additional wins his team has achieved above the <a id="page145" class="calibre4"></a>number of expected team wins if that player were substituted with a replacement-level player: a player who may be added to the team for minimal cost and effort.” I am not endorsing the accuracy of the metric; but assuming it is a reasonable representation of output, Jason Varitek, retired catcher of the Boston Red Sox, is one of the best examples I could find (figure 8.2).</p>
