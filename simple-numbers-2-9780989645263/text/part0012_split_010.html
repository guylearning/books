<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_9"><b class="calibre5">Staffing Company Exception</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Over the years we have worked with several staffing company clients from various focused industries. Staffing companies work off very thin margins, compared to other service businesses, since they are essentially being paid to recruit employees, run their payroll, and replace them if the client does not like them. They do not manage the person. For this effort, they usually get a margin of 20% to 30%. Since that margin is so tight, we include payroll taxes in the margin calculation.</p>
<p class="noindent">These clients choose one of two approaches to view their data, which demonstrates the flexibility of our structure:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">For straight staffing agencies that just provide personnel, they include wages and payroll tax in COGS. Their recruiters and account managers are considered direct labor.</li>
<li class="calibre11">If an agency has travel or other out-of-pocket costs, they are considered pass-through costs and are reflected in COGS. The contracted employee and associated payroll tax goes into direct labor, and the recruiter and account manager go into management labor. If the agency does have pass-through costs and wants to account for them like companies who do not have these costs, they are flowed through the balance sheet as reimbursable costs since they effectively inflate the revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Either methodology works, as long as you consistently apply the approach you choose.</p>
<p class="scl"><a id="page142" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Matching Labor to Demand</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">There are two key plays you can use to match your labor level to your sales demand: sell to the labor level that you commit to, or flex your labor level as your sales demand changes.</p>
<p class="noindent">A lot of clients tell us they flex their labor to demand, when in reality, their rolling 12 labor graph shows labor going up and gross margin going down. Not every industry is suited to flex labor without major pain. Some companies have tried remote workers with flexible schedules, or they look for part-time employees to match labor to demand.</p>
<p class="noindent">As an example, Starbucks considers a team member to be full time at 30 hours per week. A team member can be asked to work up to 40 hours, but they are guaranteed 30 hours in six shifts of 5 hours each. That gives Starbucks a labor flexibility of 25% with no overtime premium. They make sure to hire people who can live on 30 hours per week so managers are not pressured to schedule employees for extra hours, even if the company does not need that much labor. A key point here is that team members are scheduled in 5-hour shifts.</p>
<p class="noindent">In terms of performance, the ideal shift length for part-time workers is five hours because that is the maximum allowed before a meal break. Among our clients, we have seen that any time an employee takes a full meal break, there is a loss of productivity as the meal break approaches and a slow ramp-up after the break ends. I have yet to find a business that could mitigate this loss.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, for a full-time day worker, optimum productivity occurs in a 10-hour shift. This is the longest work day that does not cross over two meal periods. Several of our manufacturing clients have found that four 10-hour days gives them greater output than five 8-hour days. Their challenge is the same as faced <a id="page143" class="calibre4"></a>by Starbucks: finding people who want to work on that schedule and possibly keeping an overlapping team in place. A few years ago I read that USAA, an insurance company, split their team in half and went to four-day, 10-hour shifts. Half of the team worked Monday through Thursday, and the other half worked Tuesday through Friday. I do not know if that innovative model is still in place. The only concern would be customer service coverage on Monday and Friday.</p>
<p class="noindent">Certain roles may not allow for 5- or 10-hour shifts, but many production environments are well-suited for this model. The downside is that this structure introduces cultural difficulties that you have to manage. Any time an employee is working when others are not, they think they are doing all the work.</p>
