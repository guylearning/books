<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_2"><b class="calibre5">Table 3.4</b></h2>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Business case to pay 10 times net income for an acquisition</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="../images/00016.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page44" class="calibre4"></a>Assume the following:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">The company purchase price of 10 times net income includes any capitalization the company needs to meet their working capital stability standards.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Every $10 million in revenue growth will require $700,000 of additional capital.</li>
<li class="calibre11">There is no change in profitability as the company continues to grow.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">At the time of purchase, the ROIC is only 10%, which is not very exciting and is not enticing enough to accept as an outcome. The main reason someone would pay 10 times net income is they think they can grow the business better (and potentially more profitably) than the founder. You start to see why they bought the business when they get to stage 1 because they double the original business and get the ROIC up to 19%. To be fair, in table 3.4 I added more capital for each stage of growth. The time frame between each stage will determine if the additional capital will need to come from an outside source or if it can be funded from profits.</p>
<p class="noindent">At stage 2 you see the real reason why the purchaser bought the company: the ROIC increased to 33%. Keep in mind that ROIC is the year-over-year returns and does not include the terminal value of the company in a sale scenario. In the past, almost all companies that were funded from the outside looked for an exit within a 10-year horizon, but there is starting to be a shift, and owners are looking to hold their companies for the long term. As funds look for ways to give investors a return on their money, it is now making more sense to hold on to a business longer, even beyond the 10-year horizon.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consider the US public stock markets since the 2008 crash. The markets have become quite stale since then. Very few companies <a id="page45" class="calibre4"></a>have gone public, and quite a few have gone back to private. Recall that in table 2.3, which reflects data from 50 private companies, the company growth rate is 14% to 20%, whereas the overall economy is growing from 2% to 4%. It is no wonder the smart money is trying to figure out new ways to invest in private companies (without going public) instead of just flipping them. I expect the private equity market to keep thriving in the current market conditions. Their task is to bring C-suite talent to all the companies in their portfolio at a far greater value than if each company had that talent on its own. That strategy is also more attractive to the executive in each functional area because they will be in charge of a much larger and more robust business.</p>
