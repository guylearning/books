<p class="noindent1">While I always encourage our clients to correctly classify workers as employees or contractors, some industries encounter situations that are not always clear. For LER purposes, we include a contractor in COGS if they are a legitimate business and the amount you pay allows them to make a profit as a business, not just get paid a wage. Even though you might upcharge your customer for what the contractor charges you, it is reflected in your gross margin; essentially, you compensate your direct labor for interfacing with the contractor.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you hire a contracted freelancer who essentially charges a market labor rate plus payroll taxes (25% to 35% markup), it is fine to classify the freelancer as direct labor. The key is to be consistent. Many of our clients have perfected a way to keep their committed labor at peak LER and use subcontract labor to the same or better contribution margin for overflow work. If you <a id="page141" class="calibre4"></a>want to compare your contractor’s output to your team’s output, use contribution margin percentage.</p>
