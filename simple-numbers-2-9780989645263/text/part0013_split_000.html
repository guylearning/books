<p class="center">– Greg Crabtree</p>
<p class="noindent1a">Now that you have seen your business model margins and LER for your business in total, it is time go 3D to see how each segment of your business performs. Most businesses will have more than one distinct product, service, division, or location in their business model. Traditional financial presentations leave a lot to be desired in understanding how each of these segments is performing. This lack of delineation in your data opens the door to an endless stream of excuses in management meetings on why the business missed its mark this month. With more precision in your reporting, you can put your finger on exactly what’s going right—and what needs to be cut.</p>
<p class="sca"><i class="calibre14">You must face the harsh reality that corporate<br class="calibre9"/>costs need to be held accountable to the net<br class="calibre9"/>operating income generated by the segments!</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The first big mistake accountants make in segment reporting is to try to produce a full P&amp;L for each segment by allocating out <a id="page150" class="calibre4"></a>corporate or shared costs. As a young bank controller, I learned this lesson when I prepared the first ever branch profitability report for my bank. I was quite proud of it, until I showed it to the branch managers and they all protested, “Why did you allocate that to me? I don’t have anything to do with those costs!”</p>
<p class="noindent">After I thought about it, I realized that they were exactly correct. Why should their branch’s P&amp;L show anything that was not directly related to it? I modified the report to show only the actual operating expenses of each individual branch. It was corporate’s responsibility to manage the costs that were not directly associated with the branches. I also gave the branches cost-of-money credit for the deposits they generated that other branches loaned out. For the branches that loaned out more than they had in deposits, I charged them for the cost of money they used from the other branches. The managers agreed this was a more useful presentation, as it gave us a pattern of the most successful branches to try to replicate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ultimately, I learned that it is a useless exercise to allocate out corporate costs. I learned to hold corporate costs accountable to net operating income from the segments, because that income from all branches had to be high enough to cover the corporate overhead costs and make the target profit. Holding corporate costs accountable makes management uncomfortable sometimes, but facing that harsh reality is needed to build a great business.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since many businesses do not have a clean segment like a branch or location, I have developed principles for every business to define their segment reporting and take it as deep as is practical for analysis purposes.</p>
