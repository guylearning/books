<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_5"><b class="calibre5">Return on Invested Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">What is the companyâ€™s return on invested capital (ROIC)? This is the real question to determine how good a plan is. The full cash <a id="page116" class="calibre4"></a>flow forecast model gives you that number, but I will show you how to calculate the elements of invested capital here.</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Trade capital. </i>You can use several calculations to figure trade capital.
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11">Using the historical estimate of days in accounts receivable (AR), you can predict the average AR you will have to carry at the given revenue level:<br class="calibre9"/><br class="calibre9"/><b class="calibre6">AR / 365 = Day of sales</b><br class="calibre9"/><br class="calibre9"/><b class="calibre6">Day of sales x Days of AR = Average AR</b></li>
<li class="calibre11">Using the historical average of day of accounts payable (AP), you can calculate an estimate of AP:<br class="calibre9"/><br class="calibre9"/><b class="calibre6">Annual COGS / 365 = Day of COGS</b><br class="calibre9"/><br class="calibre9"/><b class="calibre6">Day of COGS x Days in AP = Average AP support from vendors</b></li>
<li class="calibre11">Other trade capital elements that could be present are assets you have to fund (inventory, work in progress, prepaid job expenses) and liabilities that help reduce asset carry (deferred revenue, customer deposits, accrued expenses).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Infrastructure capital</i>. This is the simplest type of capital because you estimate the net book value of fixed assets and intangible assets, and subtract the debt that is directly associated with them.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Buffer capital</i>. This is the core capital target concept I discussed in my previous book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits! </i>A fully capitalized business is one that <a id="page117" class="calibre4"></a>has no line of credit balance that is funding AR or inventory, plus the business has two months of operating expenses and labor in cash. Essentially, it is anything a company does not get terms on.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Launch capital</i>. There is no launch capital for the planning year since we are not making any discretionary spending bets, like we did in year 2.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The capital calculations for our example company are shown in table 7.4, along with the resulting ROIC for the minimum, target, and stretch levels we developed in table 7.3.</p>
