<p class="noindent"><a id="page152" class="calibre4"></a>As we have discussed, your operating expense structure is not that flexible, and I prefer to get any segment first to a gross margin number and then to a contribution margin number. If there are any operating expenses that would go away if that segment went away, it would be acceptable to identify those as “turn-off costs” and then get to a net operating income of segment—which would be defined as the amount of profit or loss that would disappear if that segment did not exist. It would not get allocations of overhead or other general supporting operating expenses that you would assume would remain. Your guiding principle of segment reporting is: if the revenue or expense turns on while we have this segment and turns off when it goes away, then treat that revenue or expense as a segment item.</p>
<p class="noindent">A segment can be anything that we can first get to gross margin. Then hopefully, we can connect direct labor to that gross margin and get down to a contribution margin. A common list of segments might include:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">By line of business</li>
<li class="calibre11">By customer</li>
<li class="calibre11">By division</li>
<li class="calibre11">By location</li>
<li class="calibre11">By team</li>
<li class="calibre11">By job or contract</li>
<li class="calibre11">By employee</li>
<li class="calibre11">Any other activity that can be tracked by revenue, COGS, and direct labor</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page153" class="calibre4"></a>Segments that should have similar margin and LER would be jobs, contracts, and customers. For these, your best performers will be obvious and you should work to bring the rest up to that level. Lines of business can have a dramatic difference in performance. Make sure to stay focused on margin, not revenue. For lines of business that have different margin percentages, you can use a return-on-investment rate to determine which line is best by taking segment profit divided by all of the trade capital and infrastructure capital required for that activity to get a return on investment for that segment.</p>
