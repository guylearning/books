<p class="noindent1a">Every Entrepreneur struggles to understand the dynamic relationship between profit and cash flow. Accountants have a report they refer to as a cash flow statement, but it is largely unreadable, even by accountants! Many entrepreneurs just print out a cash basis P&amp;L, which can work for small businesses that carry very little in accounts receivable or inventory. The missing purpose of why you need to keep your books on the accrual basis and monitor the balance sheet is to monitor profitability, and to have an understanding of how much capital it took for you to generate that profit—and when is it likely to turn into cash. If you gravitate to looking at cash basis reports, you do not understand the <i class="calibre8">trade capital </i>(a term I will define in the next chapter) that you had to fund to keep the business growing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Normally, during a consulting session, I would have the entrepreneur pull out their balance sheet and try to educate them on how the balance sheet moves as the business goes through seasonal cycles and growth. However, I have realized that the original design of the balance sheet was meant for the account-ants and not for understanding capital formation needs of the business. As I go through the explanation of proper capital needs for each business model, my goal is that you will come away with a better understanding of the four types of capital each business needs and what the capital signature of your model is, along with a way to measure capital efficiency and sufficiency.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page54" class="calibre4"></a>I will break traditional accounting thinking by netting certain assets and liabilities rather than using the traditional accounting presentation of “assets on the left and liabilities on the right.” Who came up with that anyway? The correct way of thinking is to connect the functional assets with their respective liabilities and look at them net of each other.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are an entrepreneur, I think you will find my approach intriguing, if not refreshing and insightful. If you are an accountant by training, you will likely struggle with it; but just remember that if our purpose is to help entrepreneurs better understand their business, you might want to take your cue from the entrepreneur and give this idea a shot!</p>
