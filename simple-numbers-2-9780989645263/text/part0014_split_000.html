<p class="sc"><i class="calibre8">A budget is a license to spend; a forecast is a<br class="calibre9"/>license to make money by spending only on<br class="calibre9"/>things that add value beyond their cost.</i></p>
<p class="center">– Greg Crabtree</p>
<p class="noindent1a">Let’s take a poll: Who wants to live or work under a budget? Even if you raised your hand, I bet you are using the wrong word to describe what you mean. Assuming everyone agrees that we want the best possible financial outcome and no one is telling a story to justify their actions, the best approach is what I call value-based spending. You spend a dollar to recover the dollar you spent plus some multiplier above that.</p>
<p class="noindent">My heartburn about budgeting comes from years of experience seeing budgets gone bad. Budgeting is a license to spend, whereas plans and forecasts are licenses to make money. Forecasts that assume all things will work perfectly usually fail. Like our team says, we always make money on the spreadsheet. You must learn to be an accurate forecaster, like Jack Stack and the Great Game of Business people stress, or your only option is to live under a cost-constraint budget.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page168" class="calibre4"></a>Since most budgets are developed on a year-to-year basis, a budget mentality is not flexible enough for midyear corrections. If you are significantly off budget in the first quarter, you will naturally disconnect from the budget and sacrifice performance for the rest of the year, until the next budgeting cycle. You could be on target with your spending for operating expenses but off budget for revenue and margin. If you stick to your budget, you will spend your way down the bankruptcy path until it is too late to correct your course.</p>
<p class="noindent">We see this play out every day in government and large corporate settings. Those organizations do not trust their management to make course corrections, and the red tape to change direction is discouraging. Spending continues as planned, regardless of receipts taken in.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Base Your Spending on Value Received</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">To base spending on value received sounds great in theory, but as a practical matter it does require some process parameters to be in place, as my experience suggests.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a 26-year-old CPA, I had just been hired away from my first job to be the controller, and eventually the VP of operations, of a $140 million local bank. Even though I had audited banks, I did not have management experience. I was good with numbers, so I used that strength to question the status quo and make suggestions for improvement. I also found that it was far more effective to bring my ideas up with the CEO directly than to introduce them in a committee.</p>
<p class="noindent">The CEO was an experienced banker, and we connected quickly. He was very busy, so I had to choose strategic times to present my new ideas. I observed that he often came in to the bank on Sunday afternoons to clear his mail, and he would walk through <a id="page169" class="calibre4"></a>the bank from the fifth floor to the first just to see if anyone was around. When he came through the third floor where my office was, I had my next idea ready for him. Most of the time it took five minutes or less for me to present my idea because I had learned what he wanted to know before he would approve an action that was not part of the original annual plan. This was also one of the best times for me to learn from him, since nobody was around; he trusted me to keep things confidential and would speak freely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before long, my fellow VPs (who were twice my age and had three times as much experience) were grumbling that I got special treatment because all my initiatives were green-lighted, and they struggled to get their ideas approved. I defended myself by saying I did not get what <i class="calibre8">I </i>wanted—I got what <i class="calibre8">he </i>wanted. I learned to listen to him and had answers ready for the questions I had learned to anticipate.</p>
<p class="sca"><i class="calibre14">The ability to look critically at a problem and<br class="calibre9"/>consider the needs of all stakeholders is a<br class="calibre9"/>foundational principle of value-based spending.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The ability to look critically at a problem and consider the needs of all stakeholders is a foundational principle of value-based spending. You must take into account everyone who is impacted by an increase or a cut. Your ability to anticipate the impact and have answers before you present is key to building the trust of the team and business leaders.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Key Areas in a Spending Plan</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">To devise a spending plan, you can create revenue and cost buckets to help guide your analysis. Here are the key areas you need to address for each choice:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page170" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">Revenue. </i>Does this spend help generate enough revenue, less cost of goods and labor, to cover the expenditure? The key mistake people make is to count revenue against the cost instead of against the net margin after cost of goods sold and labor.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Cost of goods or services. </i>Does this spend lower the cost of goods or services so the gross margin is higher than the proposed increase in spending?</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Direct labor. </i>Does this increased spend help make the direct labor more efficient, or does it reduce the direct labor by more than the amount spent? The breakout businesses we work with find a way to get more gross margin for every labor dollar spent. Sometimes this is accomplished by investing in technology, and sometimes by getting rid of ineffective technology and going old school! This is when your direct labor efficiency ratio helps you set a productivity target for the next direct labor employee.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Operating expenses. </i>Does this increased spend cause another cost to go down, or does a spending cut prevent another cost from rising to the same level or higher?</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Culture/brand. </i>Is this spend necessary to maintain the stated culture or brand? If we do not spend on this item, would it violate what we say about our company? This is the toughest answer to quantify, but your team has to reach an agreement and commit to it.</li>
</ul>
