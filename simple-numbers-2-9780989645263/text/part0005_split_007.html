<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_6"><b class="calibre5">The Fall of Peachtree Accounting</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">When you launch software to a niche market, you can charge a premium price, and there is a mutual benefit to you and your customers. But at some point you must test the broader market to grow, and sometimes that requires you to cannibalize your existing software pricing to reach the bigger market. When Peachtree Accounting launched back in the late 1980s, they charged $5,000 for their system. When QuickBooks launched, it cost around $300 and fit more users’ needs than Peachtree ever thought about. There was no way Peachtree was going to drop their price to compete with the upstart QuickBooks. Love them or hate them, QuickBooks became the dominant business accounting system by using the profits generated from their successful Quicken product to attack the business market.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">The following are descriptions of the key characteristics:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Customer funded: Yes</i>. Many customers might pay for a oneto three-year subscription, which is deferred revenue, so the business owner developed a strong understanding of the difference between profit and cash flow early in their business life.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page23" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">Recurring revenue: Yes. </i>When a company can provide core operating software for an industry, renewals can run between 60% and 80%. Those who do not renew typically never fully implemented and committed to using the software.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">High use of labor: No. </i>The cost of labor for ongoing development is not cheap, but not many skilled employees are needed. The sales process is reasonably efficient, but the sales cycle is long.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Sticky customers: Yes. </i>Once a customer implements the software, they are not likely to change.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Perceived scalability: High. </i>There is still plenty of market to penetrate. The software is mature, but a better sales process is needed.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Ability to create: Low. </i>It would be difficult to rebuild from scratch, and the slow sales cycle is a detriment to new competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In an example like this, the founders usually have to take less than a market wage in the beginning to reduce the initial burn rate. If you can get customers to pay up front, the company will have cash, and because you can use an accrual basis for taxes, you will have few tax consequences despite having cash because the tax is pushed into future years. The challenge in this example is how to not waste profits on ineffective sales and marketing and how to avoid making software enhancements that do not change potential customers’ buying choices.</p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes tech companies think they should spend all their profits to grow. I am all for that strategy when you have a good idea and execute it effectively. But if you are not effective, hold on to the profits until you have a really good idea of what will <a id="page24" class="calibre4"></a>work. My consulting firm has seen this situation many times, so we developed a concept called launch capital that helps our clients be rigorous in holding reinvestments accountable. (I will talk about launch capital in Chapter 6.)</p>
<p class="noindent">It is not uncommon for companies in this situation to have multiple years as zero EBITDA, yet sell for anywhere between 2 and 10 times revenue. That can make up for some wasted profits that did not yield results, but there is some opportunity to harvest a bit of profit in most situations like this. Not every business can get that high a revenue multiplier, but each situation gives clues as to what the buyers will consider.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Understanding Your Business as an Investment</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">As a privately held business owner, you do not have a third party like the stock market to establish a share price for you on a daily basis. This is actually a blessing since the stock market daily price is full of emotion, and there is very little technical understanding of the true value of a business. Imagine what the stock price would be for a publicly traded business if there were total transparency of its current financial position, future plans, and forecasts, without any spin!</p>
<p class="noindent">If you, as the owner, establish an understanding of and a framework for valuing your business, you are the person who sets the value of your business on a consistent basis. This is critical if you have partners, decide to share equity with key team members, or have compensation plans based on growing the value of your business.</p>
<p class="noindent">But before we discuss the value of your business, you must first have an understanding of return on investment and, more importantly, return on invested capital (ROIC) of your business, which is likely the most valuable asset in your wealth profile.</p>
<p class="scl"><a id="page25" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Rate of Return Expectation</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">As an experiment, find an entrepreneur who has not read this book or heard my speeches about rate of return, and ask them this simple question: what should you expect as an annual rate of return on your investment without selling your business? You will likely get answers that range from 10% to 20%. Those percentages come from the generally held belief that the stock market returns somewhere in that range over a period of 10-plus years. But this is a misunderstanding that stems from several points:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Public market returns are calculated off the market value at the time of investment, not invested capital.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Entrepreneurs do not understand the concept of invested capital.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Entrepreneurs do not have a commonly held definition of what a return on investment is.</li>
<li class="calibre11">There is a misperception that publicly traded companies have higher returns than private companies. This is why a discount is applied for lack of marketability when a private company is valued. Given the recent demand to purchase private businesses, you could argue that the discount for lack of marketability has been significantly reduced.</li>
</ul>
