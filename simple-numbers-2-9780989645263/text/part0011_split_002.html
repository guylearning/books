<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_1"><b class="calibre5">Setting the Target Level</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Your major focus should be on setting the target level. Ideally, your target level will be a blend of what you already have in place, the expected outcome of key initiatives you have defined with and assigned to your team, priorities that can reasonably be accomplished, and business results realized during the planning year.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here are the key points in the target level column of table 7.3:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The mLER increases to 4.00 while management labor dollars stay constant. </i>The thinking here is that the investment in new management labor increased the capacity for handling further growth. This tells <a id="page111" class="calibre4"></a>the management team that even though there was good performance in year 3, the company was still paying for the future and had not achieved optimal performance. In the team’s celebration of rebounding in year 3 (see table 7.1), it is easy for them to feel that they have earned their pay and deserve more, while you think they have not yet fully delivered on what you are already paying them for.
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11">Pay should chase performance whenever possible. It is easy to get pulled into paying before you see demonstrated performance. This always happens with a new hire, since they are unproven, but you should always avoid paying ahead for existing team members. The exception is promotions; you do not know ahead of time if the promoted person can handle their new role.<br class="calibre9"/><br class="calibre9"/>When you set the desired target for mLER, ask yourself if your current team can produce at this level and not expect to get additional labor dollars to spend on new hires, raises, or bonuses. If you believe they can, you have to overtly set that expectation; be prepared for pushback because they will naturally want more as they produce more. Your argument here is that you pay a market-based wage for market performance. By paying a market-based wage, as confirmed by wage surveys and other market sources, then setting market performance levels through planning, you can help temper your team’s pay expectations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The dLER holds steady at $3.10 from year 3.</i> Entrepreneurs often ask me what a good labor efficiency ratio is. I usually tell them the answer is in <a id="page112" class="calibre4"></a>their own data. If you look at your company history, you can usually find a time when your company hit a record in its rate of performance. I mostly look only at rolling 12 data to find the record, but sometimes I have to look at rolling 3 to see what is possible if underperformance is not a seasonal issue and rather a lack of focus and performance. In table 7.3, we did not increase the dLER, since the company was still growing into its new labor. We postponed the increase to the stretch level.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Gross margin as a percentage to sales holds at the most recent historical percentage. </i>I never change the gross margin percentage unless there is a demonstrated trend or an action that we know will impact it. This is where gross margin thinking comes in handy. Some of our most successful clients have finally eliminated the word “revenue” from their vocabulary. It is not about revenue dollars, it is all about gross margin dollars. These same clients have removed all incentives based on revenue and replaced them with either contribution margin or gross margin.
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11">My preference is to base sales incentives on contribution margin since it comes after direct labor has been applied. Salespeople complain that they do not have control over direct labor, but I say they do. They need to get to know the direct labor team and make sure they sell what the team does best, not sell stuff just to make a commission. Conversely, the direct labor team needs to spend time with the salespeople to let them know what the team does best because, if the salespeople do not sell those things, the direct labor team starves!</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page113" class="calibre4"></a>If I cannot win my argument on contribution margin, gross margin is my next preferred sales incentive basis. If I cannot specifically calculate cost of goods sold (COGS) on each sale, I will still use gross margin and apply a trailing calculation of gross margin to keep salespeople focused on not using price alone in their sales negotiations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Other operating expenses are handled the same in the target level as in the minimum level. </i>The only possible increase is if the marketing spend needs to go up as a percentage to revenue, depending on how much of a revenue increase you project. In table 7.3, no additional marketing budget is needed to accomplish revenue goals; the increased amount reflects what is needed to increase the effectiveness of the marketing efforts.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The revenue increase of $1,845,238 is the result of our bottom-up technique. </i>This is where we evaluate the work output and see if it is reasonable and meets our goals. In this case, it hits what the company felt was available in the market and what their marketing plans could reasonably bring in during the year. If the revenue number were off, the first adjustment would be to move mLER up or down as needed. If it produced a net income less than your desired target, you might even look at reducing management labor by eliminating poor performers or unneeded roles. It is not uncommon to overhire in a growth phase, thinking you need certain roles, only to discover later that the role was not needed or could be combined with another role.</li>
</ul>
<p class="scl"><a id="page114" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Setting the Stretch Level</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Now that we have established the minimum and target performance levels, we move to the stretch level. This reflects what could theoretically happen, but the likelihood falls into the 25% to 50% range. I am not a fan of making the stretch level so high that there is no reasonable chance of it happening.</p>
<p class="noindent">The main parameters we normally use are as follows (see table 7.3):</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">The mLER moves up to $4.25, and the management labor dollars increase by $200,000, which raises contribution margin by $1,225,000</i>. If you surpass this target, you will need to give bonuses or raises, or you will need to add supporting labor. I prefer to design bonus plans that include these payouts in the performance target that has to be reached, or set the target high enough that the company still keeps money after the bonus is paid.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Direct labor and dLER go up. </i>I set the dLER target back to the historical best of $3.20 (year 1 in table 7.1), which will lower the direct labor needed if there is not a revenue increase. Since we raised mLER to $4.25 and added management labor, we need to add $426,948 of direct labor to support the contribution margin volume.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">All operating expense percentages stay constant (bottom of table 7.3) because there are no conditions that warrant changing them. </i>There could be a small increase in facilities, unless you add space, but resist trimming any of the other operating expense percentages until you see them drop on a rolling 12 basis for several months. For most businesses we work with, there are not enough areas you can cut in these buckets and remain sustainable; however, there are a few exceptions that will go away, like high-cost consulting.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page115" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">The net results for the stretch level are revenue of $35 million and net income of $3.2 million.</i></li>
</ul>
