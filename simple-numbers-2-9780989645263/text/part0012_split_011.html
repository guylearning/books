<p class="noindent1">It is flattering when our clients refer to my LER concepts as Moneyball for business. Clearly there is more to Billy Beane’s statistical analysis that pulled the Oakland A’s out of the cellar and later helped the Red Sox win their first World Series in 86 years to finally overcome the curse of the Bambino! When you can get LER down to the team member who produced it, you start to have the ability to build your championship roster, just like a sports team does. You will see the productivity arc of your team as they progress, and you can start to identify who is in it for a championship run and who is in it for a season.</p>
<p class="noindent">Like all time and billing systems, the software our firm uses, Practice CS by Thomson Reuters, allows us to establish a standard billable rate by person. But Practice CS allows us to connect those billable hours to a client invoice, and it will write up or down everybody’s billable dollars to what made it to the invoice. Most simplistic time tracking systems will not do this critical step, so they do not allow you to determine actual billed value by employee. If you do not connect the ultimate value that <a id="page144" class="calibre4"></a>made it to the invoice by employee, it would be like measuring quarterbacks against pass attempts, regardless of how many were completed and for how many yards.</p>
<p class="noindent">If your time keeping system can handle this allocation process, you have a huge advantage because you can measure true output. The process is not without subjectivity, however, because you can allocate write-offs against everyone who worked on a task, even though some individuals may not have caused the loss. We win together and fail together, and even though a system may allow for specific write-offs by person, every person should support team efficiency rather than being the one who shines and saves the day. From the data I get for our firm, it is obvious who the top performers are, even though they may share some writeoffs they are not responsible for.</p>
<p class="noindent">Tracking LER by person also helps when you mix contractors in with your employees. Our clients are often shocked when they see their lack of leverage when they use contractors, compared to keeping full-time employees busy. It is not uncommon for an employee who you utilize 50% of the time to give you a higher margin than a contractor. It pays to do the math.</p>
