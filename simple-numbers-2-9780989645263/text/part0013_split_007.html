<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_6"><b class="calibre5">Service Team Segments</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">More than any other business model, service business models benefit from LER tracking by person or team. What you bill the customer is the pure output of the labor cost to provide that service. This is why timekeeping is so important, so you can evaluate the “cost” to provide the service. Most people make the error of thinking that you track time in order to bill for your time. Unfortunately, billing by the hour ultimately causes you to either give away your expertise or charge for your ignorance. The goal is to maximize the value of your labor whenever the market allows, by using fixed-price billing methods and then managing the labor to the least cost to deliver the service.</p>
<p class="noindent">The case study below is adapted from a service company that used similar labor for all three service teams, but used different approaches to sell and manage the work. We have found the concepts in the case study to apply to any service industry (legal, accounting, marketing, IT, engineering or industrial). However, LER by industry can vary dramatically, so do not use these rates as benchmarks. You must study your own industry and company to develop your own targets.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s meet the teams. Each exemplifies a distinct billing model.</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Hourly Billed Project Services (“Project”). </i>This is the most common business model in the services world. Many companies have survived a long time using this approach. Yet, in a tight labor market, it is starting to show why it has deficiencies. Common characteristics are:
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page159" class="calibre4"></a>Services are billed by the hour or by soft estimate to customer. Rarely will a job not have a write-down of time, and there is no opportunity for a write-up.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Bill rates can either be a common rate for anybody who works it or vary by skill level. My team and I are not fans of the single rate approach, since you theoretically can never work up rate, you can only work down rate.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Projects are loosely scheduled as to deadlines, but workers do not calendar out tasks. Essentially, the whole team is working from a “to do” list.</li>
<li class="calibre11">There may be a master schedule of expected project completion but little to no project status vision. If they keep time, you may have total time spent, but snot likely by task or estimate of time to complete. If you don’t track time, you are totally blind.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The process depends on a team of self-managed staff. This is nice to have and is more common in a soft labor market when more people are available to build your team. In a tight labor market, it is hard to find that skill set, and it takes time, dollars, and turnover to build those team members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Hourly Billed Scheduled Services (“Scheduled”). </i>This is a common model in the home services industries, but we see it starting to be applied in other service areas with success. Common characteristics are:
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11">Billing is generally still done by the hour or by rate sheet value for a task, but is not as prone to writedown for hourly billing. I recommend billing every two weeks and no less frequently than monthly.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page160" class="calibre4"></a>All services are managed through a calendar system to put the task on the calendar of the team members. This allows for vision of capacity and gives each team member a definite production target. The calendar has to allow for project shift and overruns, as well as leaving room for high value tasks that randomly come up.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The calendar system requires a coordinator to oversee the team calendar and pull forward or push out tasks as demand changes. It becomes pretty obvious very quickly who can work to a schedule and who either constantly works late to catch up or is just always missing schedules.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The minimum schedule would be always two weeks out, but longer is better if you have recurring tasks. This is very similar to the two-week-sprint cycle in Agile programming concepts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Fixed-Price Productized Services (“Fixed Price”)</i>. Niche segments of every industry have the service providers that found a way to bill on a fixed-price basis and control the scope of the engagement. The challenge has been to bring that approach to the broader market. This approach is more common with a non-commodity service, but we are seeing it applied with success anytime the customer prefers a fixed price and you can manage scope and create clear points of when change orders apply. Common characteristics are:
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre11">You have created a process that gives you an advantage over your competition to some or all of your service with less cost than the market. Billing <a id="page161" class="calibre4"></a>for the value of the service and not your time allows you to gain the margin you deserve.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Customers prefer a fixed price for this service instead of hourly. Fixed price is like buying an extended warranty; sometimes it makes sense, and sometimes it does not. Fixed price that is presented as a good value proposition builds pricing trust quicker than an hourly method. Most entrepreneurs tell me they hate being billed by the hour if they do not have an idea of how much time it would take.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Project quoting is faster, since you can establish common pricing for repeatable services. Customers love the ability to get a quote quickly.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Your staff has a clear idea of what to perform to, and any gains accrue to them as higher performance.</li>
<li class="calibre11">You still need to track time for cost accounting purposes. Our preferred accountability is to assign a market billing rate per person, relative to their value to the market and their salary. You multiply each person’s market rate by their hours to get what you would have charged by the hour for the project. Then you write up or down the project and allocate the billing adjustment to each person. Sophisticated billing systems will do this for you, and we have devised offline methods to create that data when the system is lacking capability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">So let’s look at the numbers for our three teams; see table 9.6.</p>
