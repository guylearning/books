<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_7"><b class="calibre5">Infrastructure Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">Infrastructure capital is easy to understand because it is the cost of your fixed and intangible assets net of the debt that supports particular assets, which normally include equipment, furniture, and building and leasehold improvements. It also includes intangible assets in a business purchase of goodwill items.</p>
<p class="noindent">In this case, the proper utilization of debt can make a huge difference in the return on investment. In a typical scenario, the bank wants you to put about 20% down on real estate and somewhere between 0% and 20% for leasehold improvements and equipment, depending on your credit history. We accountants make this a lot harder than it needs to be, as I describe in the following real-life scenario.</p>
<p class="noindent">Suppose you go to the car dealership and buy a truck for your business that costs $50,000. To get the best financing rate, you pay $5,000 down and drive away with the truck. Your accountant asks you what the $5,000 purchase was for that is booked to fixed assets, and you tell them about the truck purchase. This sets off a series of accounting adjustments:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page64" class="calibre4"></a>Fixed assets are debited for $45,000 to get the full asset value, and $45,000 is credited to book the note payable.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Each payment on the note is recorded. A credit is booked to the expense account where the note payment was recorded until the accountant found out about it, a debit is booked for the principal portion, and a debit is booked for the interest portion.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Depreciation is booked, which should be done monthly but is usually done once per year. Most businesses book it as tax depreciation instead of true book depreciation over the useful life of the asset.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">You can see why entrepreneurs hate accounting and easily get confused. If you book the down payment to an expense account called truck expense, and you book each note payment to truck expense, you would end up with <i class="calibre8">exactly </i>the same outcome over the life of the asset with a third of the accounting entries (this is essentially equivalent to the old rules of booking an operating lease). Certainly, this would be a violation of generally accepted accounting principles, but it would be closer to economic truth and easier to read and understand. If you had to send the bank a financial statement, you would note the departure of accounting process and let them know the current balances on the equipment notes. The bank already ignores the book value of fixed assets and looks at the market value for your equipment.</p>
<p class="noindent">I do not expect my thinking to become the standard of accounting presentation, but it is necessary for entrepreneurs to grasp ROIC concepts. Here is a real-life story to illustrate the point.</p>
<p class="noindent">A retail store client visited our office for a planning day. For their first five stores, they paid for the buildouts with their own funds to the tune of $200,000 to $300,000 each. We applied the ROIC <a id="page65" class="calibre4"></a>principle of 50% return standard, and they were just above it. When I modeled the potential return for the sixth store, I had them finance the buildout and treat the payment effectively as rent. As a result, the ROIC potential on that store shot up to 200%! Essentially, financing the buildout and converting it to an operating expense removed a huge barrier to scaling and provided an incredible ROIC. I told the client to be mindful that if the store fails, they will still have to pay the debt, but they will also have to pay the rent for the term of the lease. There is economically no difference, so it can be accounted for in the same way if you are looking for economic reality instead of traditional accounting presentation.</p>
