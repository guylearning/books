<p class="noindent1">ATSi is ready to move on to year 3 and put a foundation in place.</p>
<p class="noindent">Table 8.3 shows that ATSi is making progress! The key highlights of year 3 are as follows:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">It took the company until partway into the first quarter of year 3 to transition direct labor staff members who were ineffective. Then the company established a salary cap policy for hiring and raises that said no labor would be added unless dLER was $3.50 or better for that quarter. ATSi was fortunate that their revenues were consistent throughout the year, so they could see this on a quarterly basis. If their revenue had been seasonal, they would have needed to use a rolling 12 to control the salary cap.</li>
<li class="calibre11">They determined that a significant portion of their marketing spend was ineffective. You will see an adjustment in year 4.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Their operating expenses grew back to a similar level as in year 1. Trimming these costs is much like weeding a garden: it takes constant focus or they grow back; but this is not nearly as important as managing dLER.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page131" class="calibre4"></a>With only $25,000 in profit, there was not enough cash flow to meet the company’s obligations. The owner had to raise $105,482 through personal borrowing to help pay down the line of credit and keep the cash stable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="scl"><b class="calibre5">Progress in Years 4 through 7</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">The foundation was laid in year 3, so let’s look at ATSi’s successive years in table 8.4 and see their progress build.</p>
