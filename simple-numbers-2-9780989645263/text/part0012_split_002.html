<p class="noindent1">We engaged with ATSi just after the first quarter ended for year 2. Let’s look at the key highlights of their initial plan (table 8.1):</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">They forecasted 12% annual revenue growth over the previous year.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Although they planned to spend fewer marketing dollars, they expected their efforts to be more effective, at 9.3% as a percentage to sales, if their sales growth materializes.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The major plan to increase profit comes in the dLER ratio, which is expected to rise to $3.02 by keeping their labor cost flat and increasing revenue by 12%. That is not a bad strategy, as long as you have the right people in the right seats, and they have capacity.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The company predicts a $100,000 reduction in operating expenses by trimming in a few places and increasing management labor, primarily to compensate the owner at a market wage and reduce their need for distributions. (A $50,000 increase was not enough to get them to market and get off distributions, but it was a start.)</li>
<li class="calibre11">If their forecast comes to fruition, they would use all the profit to reduce their line of credit and improve their return <a id="page127" class="calibre4"></a>on invested capital (ROIC). They would not owe taxes, since they had an unused loss carrying over from year 1. (In this example, I am counting the line of credit as temporary capital, since it indicates they are undercapitalized by the amount due on their line of credit.)</li>
<li class="calibre11">Assuming this forecast holds true, the line of credit balance will drop to $31,000 and cash will stay the same if there are no distributions and accounts receivable stays roughly the same at year end.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Let’s look at table 8.2 and see what happened!</p>
