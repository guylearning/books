<p class="noindent1">This is the most common valuation method for small business transactions when one company buys another company. The buyer needs the company’s operating activity but does not need its overhead, thus the term “strip sale” since they strip out the company’s activity and bolt it on to their existing business. This is almost always done as an asset sale, with the seller responsible for paying off debts and vendors and clearing any liens on assets that were sold. For a business that is struggling, this is a good opportunity to hit the reset button and go in a different direction, and it often leads to a better valuation than trying to find someone to buy the business as is. As they say, sometimes the parts are worth more than the whole.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page46" class="calibre4"></a>A strip sale approach was used when a buyer bought my client’s business for $2 million while it was losing money. The buyer needed the company’s highly skilled labor, and it would have cost them at least that much to build a comparable team. Plus the buyer had more projects than my client did, and those projects were worth more, so assigning that work to a ready-made team would make them profitable from the first day.</p>
