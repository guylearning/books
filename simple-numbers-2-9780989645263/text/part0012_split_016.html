<p class="noindent1">When the employee hits the crossover point, they enter the chasing zone. This zone embraces the idea that, in the best compensation models, pay chases performance (not the other way around). The most tried-and-true way to maintain profitability is to have the employee prove they can produce before you increase their pay. However, if you are at risk for losing a key team member, you might have to pay before they perform. In that case, establish a new output expectation to justify the raise. If the employee resists the new expectation, you might need to let the other company draft them, and you can bring up the next player from the bench.</p>
