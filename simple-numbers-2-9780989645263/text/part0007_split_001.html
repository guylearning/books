<p class="noindent1">When an offer is pending for you to sell your business, it is very difficult to know if you are getting a good deal. The question is not so much about market value, but rather if you should sell now or wait for another time. If you are ready to sell, try to get multiple competitive offers, conjure up any strategic value idea you can muster, scrub any discretionary expenses from the books, and hope for the best. If your company is in its prime and doing well, look at the replacement return you need to get—the aftertax proceeds from the sale to replace your pretax profit so you maintain the same net income.</p>
<p class="noindent">Selling a business is emotional. For as much as the money sounds good, you are selling your creation. One of the toughest entrepreneurs I know told me that the first weekend after he sold his business, he cried like a baby and second-guessed himself, even though he got a life-changing amount of money. That really hit me.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="page49" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Replacement Return Case Study</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Going back to the behavioral economics concept, I needed a way to help my clients frame their thinking for the potentially lifechanging decision to sell their business. An idea came to me when a client called to discuss the potential sale of his business. His capital advisors had brought multiple offers at seven times net income to the table. The advisors (who stood to make $1.5 million in fees at this price) were telling him the offers were a good deal at a premium price, and they advised him to sell. I told him that even though the offers were indeed at a premium, they were still not enough. In a moment of inspiration, I did the math to help him think through the decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">He had a great business in a growing market, and his top-notch management team allowed him to work 15 hours per week in a strategic role, not an operational one. Plus he was drawing a generous market-driven CEO salary that allowed him to live comfortably. If he were to sell the business for seven times net income and pay taxes at the capital gain rate, he would have to get a replacement return of 18% to break even (the company’s current net income divided by after-tax proceeds from the sale). I explained that instead of selling now, he could keep the business, harvest the profits for a few more years, continue the company’s current growth rate, then sell the company for more. I said that even though there would be a risk that something in the future could change, a sale at seven times net income was not enough, given that the company was profitable and fully capitalized. I left the decision up to him with a cautionary note that the math said he could do better.</p>
<p class="noindent">He called me back in a week and said he got the offer up to 10 times net income, which brought the replacement return to about 10%. I gave him the green light to proceed with the sale. The change from 7 times to 10 times net income was life-changing money.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page50" class="calibre4"></a>Helping this client make such a pivotal decision was one of the most rewarding moments in my career. Although I did not get a percentage of the increase, I learned a far more valuable lesson: the strongest tool to increase the price is the power to say no and not be hurt if the sale falls through.</p>
