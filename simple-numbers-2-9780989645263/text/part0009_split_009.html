<p class="noindent1">In my first book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!</i>, I established a cash standard for all businesses. It says that cash should always be equal to two months of operating expenses and zero drawn on a line of credit. Essentially, any expense you do not get terms on would be part of this calculation (all labor and operating expenses). The way I arrived at this was to research four years of client data and look for the deepest negative cash flow cycle in any given month. For a normally operating business, I never saw a dip greater than two months of operating expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent">As we started sharing this metric and driving our clients to use it, we realized the best part was that entrepreneurs could easily see how much cash is enough and how much cash is too much. It clearly defined what it looks like to be fully capitalized. I am fine with debt, and I even encourage it when it matches the true useful life of a productive asset like buildings and equipment. But the perpetual financing of trade capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory, put severe constraints on a well-functioning business.</p>
<p class="noindent">My approach was proven in 2008. The media was full of reports about lines of credit being pulled from businesses, but my clients <a id="page66" class="calibre4"></a>were not concerned. Instead, they asked me how to protect their cash in such a crazy market. I then realized they had been listening. In the three years that followed, while everyone was complaining about a recession, my clients enjoyed some of their most profitable years because they had cash and, therefore, market power. Because of the recession, their growth was limited to taking over competitorsâ€™ accounts, but they fared better than those who went out of business because of being overleveraged.</p>
