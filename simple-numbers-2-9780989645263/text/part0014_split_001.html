<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_0"><b class="calibre5">Evaluate Normal Ongoing Operations</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">For recurring or normal operations, the best approach is to question each cost decision as it is presented and ask this value question: are we still getting value from this item? If not, either <a id="page171" class="calibre4"></a>stop it and see if anyone misses it, or bring it up for review by the next-higher management level and anticipate what answers will be needed, as in my banking story earlier in this chapter. The best review of normal operating expenses can be done by looking at rolling 12 trends for these groups of large expenses:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Facilities</li>
<li class="calibre11">Marketing</li>
<li class="calibre11">Other operating expenses (catchall bucket)</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">When you see a rolling 12 trend that looks odd, drill down into the line item costs.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here are a few tricks of the trade that work well:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Credit card charges. </i>Make sure to record credit card charges in detail. It is best to download them into your accounting system so you have the vendor name for each charge.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Vendor summary. </i>Run a quarterly report of your total spend by vendor, and rank them from largest to smallest. It is amazing how many times this causes overspending to pop out. A traditional profit and loss statement will not highlight this problem.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Recurring credit card and Automated Clearing House (ACH) charges. </i>Watch for recurring bills, credit card charges, and ACH charges for things that are no longer being used. This is the reason your gym wants you to pay monthly and forget about coming! Credit card companies have reports that list recurring charges and anticipated upcoming charges. If you do not have your account set to send you those reports, go to the company’s website and turn them on. Also turn on email notifications for merchant credits so you can be sure they actually credit you after you cancel an order.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page172" class="calibre4"></a><i class="calibre8">Chart of accounts. </i>Less is more, so do not create insignificant accounts. When you overdo it, your reports will be too noisy and you will not notice all those fine details. As a general rule, you do not need a general ledger account for an item that costs $1,000 or less in a year—I could even live with a $5,000 threshold. Current accounting software can drill down to the details and generate other reports, so a long chart of accounts is no longer necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">As a rule of thumb for most business models, if I add a dollar of operating expense to increase productivity (other than labor), I generally want it to create $2 of revenue. Marketing expenses depend on each business. Separate expenditures for branding and general awareness marketing from expenditures for transactional marketing, such as search engine optimization, AdWords, and so forth.</p>
<p class="noindent">Thinking about value-based spending will help you avoid the pitfalls of a budgeting mindset. It can lead to a more adaptive approach to help you trim costs in a tight market and scale up when the market is hot.</p>
