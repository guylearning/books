<p class="noindent1">Instead table 5.2 you can see why businesses that do stuff struggle with ROIC. If this services business did not have deferred revenue, their ROIC would be close to 33%. Based on public markets, that would be okay, but it underperforms all other models and explains why service firms break up easily and often <a id="page72" class="calibre4"></a>fail to scale. They do not have an understanding of their capital requirement or the discipline to meet a capital goal, even if they have one. Many professional services firms we work with have a hard time breaking away from the old model of stripping all their cash out each year and living on their line of credit until they pay it back. To expose the weakness in this approach, all it takes is one year where the balance on the line of credit does not go down and there is no cash. Their highest-performing employees end up leaving, and they are left with only their weakest performers.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is one model where I can see a one-month core capital number if a company has a strong recurring client billing. But if the billing can be random and lumpy, they should commit to the two-months rule.</p>
<p class="noindent">The company in table 5.2 is in a cash-free growth zone due to the deferred revenue. Once again, if the deferred revenue ever goes away, their trade capital would jump to roughly $1.5 million with the same profit of roughly $1 million (their trade capital percentage to revenue would be 15%), and they would run out of cash while they are waiting to get paid. Instead of growing quickly, they would need to use the base camp approach to growth.</p>

<p class="noindent1">To drive home the picture of the cash-free growth zone, we created the Cash Power Ratio (CPR) in Figure 5.1.</p>
