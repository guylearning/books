<p class="center">– Greg Crabtree</p>
<p class="noindent1a">I am fortunate to interact with many successful entrepreneurs and get to know the real story of how they achieved success. Through our consulting and accounting practice, we see the most intimate details of those businesses, and I have enough gray hairs to have seen many of them from start to exit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Most people think business is complex, but there is a simple overarching structure to most things, and I believe I have discovered three simple rules to achieve launch <i class="calibre8">and </i>sustainability <i class="calibre8">and </i>a successful exit:</p>

<ol class="calibre10">
<li value="1" class="calibre11">Figure out what the market needs.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre11">Find a way to do it profitably.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre11">Achieve a 50% or better pretax return on invested capital (ROIC), year over year.</li>
</ol>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Does It Meet a Market Need?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Entrepreneurs have generally been pretty good at figuring this part out. It is not complex; find an unmet need and see what the market will pay for a product or service that fills the gap. It does <a id="page6" class="calibre4"></a>not have to be something new; it could just be a new way of interfacing with the customer.</p>
<p class="noindent">When we reimagined what entrepreneurs need from an accounting firm, it started with finding out what business owners were not getting from the profession. I used my Entrepreneurs’ Organization forum as my focus group since they fit the profile of who I wanted as clients, but I could not do business with them according to forum rules. This allowed for an unusually strong focus group since they were not my clients, but they were motivated to help me run a better business. The focus group identified the following needs:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Elimination of tax day surprises: </i>Require at least a quarterly review of current-year tax implications, and set aside tax funds as they are earned rather than paying taxes one year behind.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Fixed-price billing: </i>If you bill by the hour, you are either giving away your expertise or charging for your ignorance.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Having an idea of what works (and what does not): </i>The accounting profession lost sight of helping their clients run best-in-class businesses and became more focused on selling billable hours that do not add value. They overlooked the fact that they had the data in their hands to research best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">All of this understanding led our practice away from being a CPA firm that did consulting when it was not tax season to being a consulting firm that provides CPA services only to clients we consult with. We now bill only on a fixed-price basis, and we have essentially turned our services into products. (The only exception is outsourced bookkeeping.) Our focus has changed to studying the data that is in front of us each day, and we develop our own beliefs about critical success factors in business. As a <a id="page7" class="calibre4"></a>result, we can help when we have a client who wants to create a planned outcome, instead of simply providing a commodity service.</p>
<p class="noindent">Commodity services are still needed, but they come with the burden of having lower margins, and the services are usually delivered by bigger, more capitalized businesses that make competition difficult. If I can find my niche, the “bigs” will have trouble competing, and I can be more profitable with much less revenue.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Can You Do It Profitably?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Now that you have an idea to fill a market need, can you deliver it in a way that will appeal to customers and still make a profit? This is usually where entrepreneurs get trapped into revenue thinking instead of margin thinking. Part of the solution to better serve your customers may be reselling someone else’s goods or services and adding your labor to tie it all together. Think of those outside goods and services as pass-through costs because they are bait to attract the more profitable part of the transaction that you perform.</p>
<p class="noindent">In my previous book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!</i>, I hypothesized that at 5% profit you would barely break even in cash flow, at 10% you would have a good business, and at 15% you would have a great business. I came up with those levels by observation, and they still work for about 70% of businesses. However, I saw that there were outliers that could have a lower profit and still were great businesses. Many of them had low gross margins and relied on volume, but others who tried this strategy failed miserably. I also noticed that some businesses attempted high-margin models and failed, so margin had to be just one element of the solution. There was a missing piece. The trail to solve the mystery led me to the document most entrepreneurs struggle to understand and rarely look at: the balance sheet!</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="page8" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Does It Meet the Minimum ROIC Standard?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">I discovered the missing piece when I started researching ROIC. Later I will detail how to measure and evaluate that metric and how to use it to set your profit target. The questions are: Of the capital I invest into my business, does net income provide a reasonable return? Do I have access to the required capital through my own cash, investors, or debt?</p>
<p class="noindent">To whet your appetite for the later discussion of ROIC, let me tease you with a number: 50%. Based on our research for businesses in the US and Canada, the minimum acceptable ROIC should be no less than 50%, and the average across most industries is 75%.</p>
<p class="noindent">I have often said that if someone can demonstrate their ability to run a profitable business, it is not that hard to get access to capital. The challenge is how to demonstrate you can do it if you do not have the capital to pull it off yourself. This is when you can develop a minimum viable product, create a “test kitchen,” or start small with what you can fund to prove the concept. After the proof of concept, outside capital is often not needed for growth. You can grow as fast as you can manage it just by reinvesting your own profits with perhaps some temporary financing from the bank. Certainly, some big initiatives require a lot of infrastructure, but the vast majority of new initiatives do not. The business grows by adding the next productive team member, the next profitable customer, the next profitable location—one at a time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Since we have been using this approach to help our clients evaluate growth and new business initiatives, it really makes them pause when a new plan has no potential to meet the 50% ROIC standard, and it sheds light on why nobody else may have been successful. If you are in this situation, see if you can change either the profitability or the capital requirement.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="page9" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Can You Change the Profitability?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">The error most entrepreneurs make in estimating profit is to start with a cost-build-up pricing model to determine what they should charge. While I agree that costs are important, I prefer to start with the price my target customer is willing to pay, then see what the minimum cost would be to deliver.</p>
<p class="noindent">Smaller niche businesses have more pricing power since they are not big enough to attract a predatory well-funded large business to drive the price down through competition. Leveraging technology to enhance labor productivity is another key to profitability. Also, never forget that plain old world-class execution is your best protection from competitors and is a profit generator. Very few businesses can really deliver.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another way to look at profitability enhancement is to share part of the transaction with another business, particularly if you have weaknesses in some aspect of fulfillment. Good metrics show that 30% to 40% of any transaction’s value is the sales, marketing, and customer service component, whereas delivery of the product or service is 60% to 70%. If you can share the customer with someone else, you can negotiate good terms that specify you do not pay them until you get paid, which lowers your capital need. We will look at that in detail later when we discuss the capital signature of your business model.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Can You Change the Capital Requirement?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">It has been enlightening to see our clients respond to the challenge of reducing their capital requirements when their business idea falls short of the 50% return. The best time to get better terms from your suppliers and customers is when you start a new activity. Once customers and vendors become accustomed to your terms, it is difficult to change them unless you are in a power position. Even if you have power, it can sometimes <a id="page10" class="calibre4"></a>damage the relationship and possibly damage your customer or vendor as well since they are not prepared for the change.</p>
<p class="noindent">For starters, here are a few techniques to reduce your capital requirements:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Try to get the entire payment in advance, or get as large of a payment as possible in advance, as long as the remaining payment does not take so long that it negates the benefit of the up-front payment.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Maintain tighter inventory control over slow-moving stock (but never run out of key items).</li>
<li class="calibre11">Take credit card payments for some or all transactions. Even though your merchant fee can be 2% to 3%, it might be worth it if you lack capital to fund the activity, not to mention the labor cost of chasing down payments and bad debts. One of my favorite Gregisms is “Never make it hard for someone to give you money.”</li>
<li class="calibre11">Get extended terms from vendors if you are selling products or subcontracted services. It is common for a company’s subcontractors to get paid after the company itself gets paid.</li>
<li class="calibre11">For ongoing services, charge a fixed monthly fee that keeps you equal to or slightly ahead of the effort required to provide those services. If the start of services requires up-front effort, try to offset it with an up-front fee that equals or exceeds the cost of the initial effort so you do not dig a cash hole from the start.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Turn a capital cost into an operating expense. If your activity requires equipment or a retail store buildout, finance the cost and turn the payment into an operating <a id="page11" class="calibre4"></a>expense over the useful life of the item being financed. Your profit will be lower because of the payment, but your yield will still be accelerated. If you use financing, you need to have a greater certainty of success and you need to be willing to pay off the debt if the business fails.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Understanding these three rules is a great example of the Hawthorne Effect, where people modify their behavior just because they are being observed. When we educated one of our clients in the staffing industry on the interrelationship of these rules, they created new offerings for their customers that were more profitable, they got paid faster, and the customer got a project billing structure they preferred over standard hourly billing. That led to profit going from 3% to 10% and ROIC rising from 23% to 51%. Half of the rise in ROIC was due to the profit, but the other half was due to needing less capital because they were getting paid faster. They saw more opportunity once they were aware of the power to be found in the interplay of these three rules. In other words, they went from playing checkers to playing chess!</p>
<p class="noindent">The good thing about being an entrepreneur is that you get to decide on the strategy. If you match the market need to the profit model and the capital model, you will be successful—assuming you can execute!</p>
