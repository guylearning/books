<p class="noindent1">The “Sell Stuff” example in table 5.1 is based on a distributor model. At first glance, you wonder how the company survives <a id="page59" class="calibre4"></a>on a 13% gross margin; but you can see that of the three businesses in table 5.1, they have the highest net income as percentage to gross margin at 23.21%. Once again, the harsh reality is that this business owner does not have a $40 million business. It is a $5.35 million inventory management company. To work on a margin this thin, they have invested in the best inventory management systems, processes, and automated handling capabilities. They are world class in their ability to execute a repetitive process because there is not enough margin for error—literally!</p>
<p class="noindent">I often tell my clients who sell stuff that the accounting process for inventory is theoretically very simple, but less than 5% of businesses who have inventory are good at it. Most businesses get close, true up the difference once a year (quarterly at best), and slug an unknown variance that no one can explain into COGS. Does that sound familiar to anyone?</p>
<p class="noindent">You could break down a Selling Stuff model into two segments: businesses that never handle inventory (or only what has already been sold so they can fulfill orders), and businesses that carry stock with no specific customer to buy it. From a capital perspective, if you stock your items, you carry more inventory and typically get paid at sale or carry lower accounts receivable. If you sell items that other companies fulfill, you will typically have higher accounts receivable waiting to get paid, which trades off the carrying cost of inventory. The worst capital structure is when a business gives corporate terms of 30-plus days on accounts receivable and also carries inventory. In that case, the business needs a really high profit margin to be viable because of the capital signature.</p>
