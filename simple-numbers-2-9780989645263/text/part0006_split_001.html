<p class="noindent"><a id="page38" class="calibre4"></a>Many entrepreneurs think they can accelerate the buyout or leverage it. The only business that can grow its way into an accelerated payoff is one that does not need additional working capital to grow. If the company requires growth in accounts receivable or inventory, it is very difficult to pay off a buyout faster. The only situation where I have seen a faster payoff is when the exiting partner was a barrier to growth and the company hit new highs in both profit and growth once that partner was out of the business.</p>
