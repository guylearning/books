<p class="noindent1">Segment profitability is pretty simple when you have locations or very distinct operating divisions. However, segment analysis <a id="page151" class="calibre4"></a>can go much deeper than that. The key is to not get sucked into allocation hell trying to get to a corporate net income by segment. There are three levels you can dive down to in segment reporting: Gross Margin (Level 1), Contribution Margin (Level 2), and Net Operating Income for Segment (Level 3). When we first start working with a new client, many will only have Gross Margin data. As they see the benefits of tracking direct labor, we can get them to Level 2, Contribution Margin. Typically, most segments stop here unless you have a formal division or location structure. Any of the three levels can be useful, but the deeper you can go with accurate tracking of costs, the more insight you will have.</p>
