<p class="noindent1">Is the company in our example facing a mature market for their product or service in their designated service area? Table 7.1 shows the company jumped to a reasonable level of market maturity with their growth from year 2 to year 3. In year 3 they will be more focused on maintaining what they have, with some incremental improvement, until they define their next major market move. If your company is in the midst of a major growth initiative, this would not demonstrate enough growth between levels.</p>
