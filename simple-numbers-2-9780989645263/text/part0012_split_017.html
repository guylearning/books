<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_16"><b class="calibre5">Replacement Zone</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">The toughest part of personnel management occurs in the replacement zone. The harsh reality is that we all reach a point when, after a long run of successful productivity, our pay exceeds our output. Larger companies can experiment with options like changing roles and adjusting pay. Smaller companies must act faster because they have only a few key producers. This is why <a id="page148" class="calibre4"></a>we encourage companies to invest in systems and processes that measure team members’ output so you can help extend their career as their performance starts to wane. Also, you must be careful to not attribute lower margins to labor if you are not raising prices to keep up with inflation in your labor costs. When you face the data objectively, you have a much better chance of keeping your team productive longer and reducing drama when replacements are needed. My bet is there will always be something for capable people to do if you are willing to adapt.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">LER as a Tool for the Future</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">When I first created the principles and methodology of LER, I had no idea how big it would become. My team has witnessed its impact and the clarity it gives our clients, who now have a metric to match up to what they see in the business and what they cannot see when they are away from the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">I predict that LER will continue to gain popularity as technology starts to enhance team members’ roles in a labor-constricted economy. Who knows where it will go from there?</p>
