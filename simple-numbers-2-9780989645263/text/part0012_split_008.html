<p class="noindent"><a id="page140" class="calibre4"></a>The first time that I saw an A-player grid, it was a typical four-quadrant consultant box. Most of my Entrepreneursâ€™ Organization peers agree that culture, on the y-axis, is important enough to require that employees reach a level of 7 or higher. I always challenge my audiences to plot each of their team members on this graph. Very few people accept the challenge because they do not want to turn over that many people at once. Employees who fall in the bottom-left corner are easy for most of us to terminate quickly; those team members are low on culture and low on productivity. The employees in the upper-left quadrant are the lovable slackers. You like them, but they never get enough done to meet their productivity goals and are often found holding up the walls in the hall while talking to passersby. People in the bottom-right quadrant are the toughest to deal with; we call them the terrorists. They produce a lot but destroy your culture, and if you let them go it will cause a short-term loss. You wonder if they are truly committed to your culture or your profit.</p>
