<p class="sc"><i class="calibre8">You have to learn </i>why <i class="calibre8">things work on a starship.</i></p>
<p class="center">– Captain James T. Kirk (<i class="calibre8">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</i>)</p>
<p class="noindent1a">As the CEO of your business, you can surround yourself with technical expertise in sales, marketing, operations, and finance, but you need to know <i class="calibre8">why </i>and <i class="calibre8">how </i>they all fit together. You will need a technical or intuitive understanding of profit and capital for each activity in your business.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you simplify all the business models in the world, they come down to three activities: manufacturing (make stuff), sales and distribution (sell stuff), or providing services (do stuff). You may do one, two, or all three of these activities, but each employs a distinct profit and capital model within the same business. However, if you want to scale your business, you should focus on the one thing you do best.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are great at manufacturing but fall short in sales, you should partner with a sales organization. You might be great at selling stuff but not world class at making it, so contract with a manufacturer that can do it better for a lower price. It is not <a id="page56" class="calibre4"></a>uncommon for technology sales businesses to expand into providing services and fail miserably. They forget to account for service employee downtime that is not billable, and they struggle to interpret fluctuations from project to project because they are not selling tangible items with a consistent margin, as in the sales side of their business. They quickly learn that they need a lot more people in services to generate the same margin as one salesperson. And they struggle with the service value of each employee—a variable human component that does not exist in hardware.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once I started to categorize all my clients and their business segments into these three categories—make stuff, sell stuff, or do stuff—I saw an amazingly consistent set of metrics across all businesses of each type. These metrics help businesses with multiple types of activities understand where they make the most profit so they do not sacrifice their success in the pursuit of an activity they are ill-suited for, or in which they would have to sink money into fixing things.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Let’s start our comparison of the three business models from a familiar point of reference: profit and loss (as shown in table 5.1).</p>
