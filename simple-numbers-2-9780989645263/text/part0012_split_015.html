<p class="noindent1">When someone starts working for you, they rarely produce enough in the beginning to justify their pay. It could take days, weeks, months, or years for their productivity to exceed their pay, and this period is called the training zone. It is important to make the training zone as compressed as possible, but it also needs to be effective. Make sure the person knows they cannot stop improving when they produce more than they make, which I call the crossover point. This is just the beginning of the chase!</p>
