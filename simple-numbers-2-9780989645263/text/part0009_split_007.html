<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_6"><b class="calibre5">Trade Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">The term <i class="calibre8">working capital </i>has always bothered me. It is taught in accounting school, and bankers have faithfully beat up their borrowing customers with that metric for years. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. It seems simple enough, but it tells an incomplete truth. Working capital contains two items: cash on the asset side, and line of credit on the debit side. I choose how much cash I keep in the business and how much I decide to put in or take out. I choose whether to borrow funds from the bank or put my own cash in to support accounts receivable and inventory.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page62" class="calibre4"></a>Because my firm models every business we work with, I started looking into this deeper and realized there was a clear subcomponent of working capital lurking below the surface. Trade capital is working capital with cash and line of credit (all short term debt) stripped out. It is the net of accounts receivable, inventory, and work in progress, less accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue. The resulting number tells you how much recurring income you will have at this volume of sales. Unless you act to change terms with vendors and customers, trade capital will remain constant in your model, and we use it to predict cash flow from operations rather than needing to predict each individual line of trade capital for forecasting.</p>
<p class="noindent">It was eye opening to discover that the easiest way to predict operating cash flow is not the action of the individual trade capital components, but the harmony of how they interact; and I only need to look at the net number. By looking at the net number, it also helps my strategy decisions. For example, I can worry about inventory levels, but when my vendors give me good enough terms that I have no real net cost of carry, why would I ever risk being out of stock?</p>
<p class="noindent">This is the weakness of the traditional balance sheet presentation. If I were to redesign it, I would net the elements of trade capital in one group, instead of putting assets on the left and liabilities on the right. For all our clients, we add this net number in our balance sheet presentation, then we show trade capital as a percentage of rolling 12 revenue. The power of this calculation is amazingly simple:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page63" class="calibre4"></a>If your trade capital percentage to revenue is lower than your net income percentage to revenue, you are in the cash-free growth zone. You can accept growth and not burn cash, as long as net income percentage is higher than trade capital percentage.</li>
<li class="calibre11">If your trade capital percentage to revenue is higher than your net income percentage to revenue, you have to use the base camp growth method. To grow, you will burn cash to invest in accounts receivable or inventory; you can grow only as far as your cash and debt resources allow. Then you pause for a time to let the cash flow catch up, and you let it build it for another growth run to the next base camp.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">This is why some companies have linear growth and others have a growth spurt, flatten out, and have a growth spurt again.</p>
