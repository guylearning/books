<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_1"><b class="calibre5">Market Value</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">There is a very good reason why an outside investor may pay a market value higher than my economic value calculation. Money chases easy, while entrepreneurs overcome hard. Given the alternative investments available for money to gravitate toward, a profitable business can still yield significantly more than market investments and, if you have money, you do not have to endure the building of a business. The founder gets a nice value for the business they built, and the investor can take it to the next level and often infuse new energy and structure the business to scale it. That is the premise every buyer starts with, but it still works less than half the time. Just make sure the check clears when you sell!</p>
<p class="sca"><i class="calibre14">Money chases easy.<br class="calibre9"/>Entrepreneurs overcome hard.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Since an investment in a privately held business is not easily liquid, it usually requires a higher yield to attract investment. In recent years we have started seeing higher premiums for many businesses, even at smaller revenue sizes. There is so much cash looking for a place to invest and so few businesses for sale that prices are being driven up across the board.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page39" class="calibre4"></a>When public companies are growing and the stock market is making great returns, private company valuations stay in the four to six times net income range. (There are industry outliers, like tech, that require more of a bet placed on the future than reliance on current fundamentals.) Investors tend to flock to the public market instead of driving up private company prices since public companies have ready liquidity if the owners want to get out, whereas private companies take much longer to become liquid. When the stock market is near a bubble high and interest rates are very low for fixed income investing, value multiples start to approach 7 to 10 times net income. Money has to find someplace to go. To make great yields from a private business, you need not only cash but skill, or you have to pay someone who is skilled to use your capital wisely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Table 3.3 examines the same buyout example as shown in table 3.1 but with market value calculations at 5 times, 7.5 times, and 10 times net income. You can see that it takes about five years for the five times net income buyout of the 50% partner. As you start to move up the premium scale, the buyout time gets longer and longer.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="page40" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 3.3</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Example of 50% buyout</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="../images/00015.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="noindent">In case you are thinking about selling to a key executive, the management team, or a family member, table 3.3 shows the 100% sale amortization that ranges from 10-plus years to almost 36 years. As a practical matter, you are not likely to successfully complete a 100% sale from cash flows that lasts longer than 10 years. (The Small Business Administration usually lends for only seven years for this type of debt.) Once the value gets beyond five times net income, a capital injection of outside money will be needed to make this type of sale work, except in the rarest of circumstances.</p>

<p class="secl"><a id="page41" class="calibre13"></a><b class="calibre5">Selling to an Insider</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">A sale to someone internally who works for you is hard to pull off with outside debt. The lender is not sure the business will continue to perform as it has, and the purchaser is not coming to the table with any money, just internal experience. If you want to get more money up front, the purchaser will have to raise some outside capital to supplement the debt used at the time of purchase.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">This is an important point for multiple shareholders to understand when crafting buy/sell agreements. The company cannot usually fund a market value buyout from cash flow when the market is paying a premium for businesses. Structuring a buy/sell agreement to have an appraisal for valuation is a trap that often causes an early sale of the whole company, rather than one partner taking over after the other partner leaves. Sometimes there are dueling appraisals, when each partner hires their own appraiser, or the partners might agree to use the same appraiser. Unless the appraiser is directed to use only a historical or forward-looking discounted cash flows approach, the partners end up with an unworkable outcome that usually blows up one to two years into the deal.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a planning philosophy, it is hard to argue that the partner who leaves early, without the total sale of the business, deserves more than the economic value. Any attempt to pay the exiting partner more than their share of the economic value usually leads to a failed payout, and nobody is happy. The remaining partner needs to keep the company healthy while using all available profits to buy out the exiting partner. In most businesses, it does not work to stress the working capital or try to grow out of the payout</p>

<p class="secl"><a id="page42" class="calibre13"></a><b class="calibre5">Case Study: Sale to Employee Stock Ownership Plan</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">I worked with a client who decided they wanted to sell their business to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) instead of selling it outright. The founders had done a good job of building a management team that would take over and run the business. They wanted to sell 100% of the business to the ESOP, and they would take back notes to fund the sale.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though there are significant tax benefits that would help increase cash flow to justify a slight premium to value, the deal would still have to make sense from a cash flow perspective. The founders selected an independent appraiser to value the business, and the appraised value made them happy since it was based on market sales of similar businesses at a time when crazy speculative premiums were being paid. My task was to deliver the bad news to the founders that the deal would never go through at that price, and either their notes would be in default shortly into the deal or they would be forced to sell the business.</p>
<p class="noindent">The founders were convinced the deal would work even though it required increases in profitability and growth that the company had never seen. Needless to say, two years into the deal there was not enough cash flow to service the notes, and the company was sold to another ESOP company that had idle cash and was willing to pay close to the original price. Even though the outcome would have been worse if a new buyer had not stepped in, it did not play out the way all of the stakeholders had wanted. You cannot get maximum value and sell to someone who does not have the cash or the financing ability to pay full price.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page43" class="calibre4"></a>because there is no money to operate with after closing. The only businesses that grow out of this arrangement are the rare ones that require very little increase in working capital to grow.</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Why Would Someone Pay a Premium?</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">When you compare the dollar figures for economic value and market value, you start to rethink that quaint idea of selling to a key employee or a family member for just the cash flow value. This is the biggest reason why family businesses have become rare—not because of social reasons. The market to buy and sell businesses is much more sophisticated than ever before, and it extends much more effectively into businesses valued at less than $5 million than it did prior to the dot-com era in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="noindent">As I said in the return on invested capital (ROIC) discussion, when the ROIC potential is high, the market finds a way to capitalize on it when there is plenty of cash to risk. To prove my point, let’s look at the example in table 3.4.</p>
