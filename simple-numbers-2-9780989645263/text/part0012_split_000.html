<p class="center">– Greg Crabtree</p>
<p class="noindent1a">Since I created the Simple Numbers approach to analyzing data, I have become associated with the term “labor efficiency ratio,” affectionately known as LER. It has become a key diagnostic and management tool for those who adopt it. Like all tools, it can take time to master, but it has proven to be effective at keeping track of productivity for both direct and management labor.</p>
<p class="noindent">In my first book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!</i>, I talked about overall LER, which is gross margin divided by all labor. This measure can be effective for businesses under $5 million in revenue that do not have a clear distinction of what is direct labor and what is management labor. Also, when I wrote my previous book, I had not completed enough sample data sets in which we broke out direct labor and management labor to confidently report on how to separate them. Since then, we have divided LER into the two types of labor with all our clients; we have even taken LER down to the segment reporting level with great effectiveness.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="page121" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Uniqueness of LER in Financial Analysis</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">There is a good reason for why you will never see LER in a public company’s financial statement. They do not want you to see labor broken out by type because you would be able to identify the most critical aspect of their business management strategy (for better or worse). If there is any mention of labor in the financial statement, it focuses on some portion of labor, but it is typically hidden in other costs.</p>
<p class="sca"><i class="calibre14">Labor should never be mixed with another cost.<br class="calibre9"/>It is the only cost that comes to work<br class="calibre9"/>every day with an attitude!</i></p>
<p class="noindent">When we did our original research, it became painfully obvious that labor dollars measured against some form of margin was a more intuitively correct analysis than measuring bodies per revenue dollar. A CEO can always make a quick change to make the labor ratio look better by slashing the lowest end of the pay spectrum, but that is usually not where the fix is needed. We also homed in on a point that every business owner should understand: labor must be broken out and never mixed with a nonlabor cost, because it is the only cost that comes to work every day with an attitude! Labor is a variable output cost that largely depends on your management skill, strategy, and sometimes your willpower!</p>
