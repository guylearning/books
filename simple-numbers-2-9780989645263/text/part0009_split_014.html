<p class="noindent1">The Sell Stuff model in table 5.2 represents a distributor, and they carry inventory and receivables. They run a tight ship on collections and inventory turnover, so their vendors fund almost all of their receivables and inventory. You can see that they are slightly better on trade capital percentage to revenue and net income percentage to revenue. This means that, for now, they can grow their profit and cash equally, but they cannot let any trade capital components go negative on them or it collapses quickly. When the percentages are very small, it requires even closer monitoring than normal to not let it flip and go cash negative.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some distribution companies only sell products and never take possession of the items they sold. In many of those cases, their profit margin is very low and they have to give longer terms, which often negates the benefit of not carrying inventory. I can still see this as a better play if a company is not good at building a team of people to effectively manage inventory. In table 5.2 you can see that they have a significantly higher infrastructure capital number than the other two models because of their inventory management equipment and software investment, such as bar coding and radio-frequency identification (RFID) capability.</p>
