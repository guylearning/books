<p class="noindent1">In the ATSi case study earlier in this chapter, the company did not track hours by billable event. They are what I call a productized service business that charges a fixed price for each service. ATSi tracks teams of people who are responsible for each group of services, and that allowed them to identify some services that needed price increases and others that needed to be discontinued. It also allowed them to manage growth by team because, in terms of growth, certain services outpaced others. In a perfect world, we could track growth by person, but the team approach is valid.</p>
