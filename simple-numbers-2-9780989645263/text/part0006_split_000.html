<p class="sc"><i class="calibre8">Price is what you pay, value is what you get.</i></p>
<p class="center">– Warren Buffett</p>
<p class="noindent1a">Now that we have established a framework to understand your business from an investment standpoint, we can assess its value and implement a decision-making tool to help you decide when to sell your business, or keep it, based on the economics.</p>
<p class="noindent">The marketplace can be a cruel taskmaster when it comes to valuing your business. In my experience, the first offer that starts the selling discussion never goes any higher once the term sheet is signed, so you must get the value right before the initial negotiation. The market sees every business model differently, so it tends to overvalue sexy businesses at times.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is also important to understand the buyer’s purchasing power. If the buyer has enough cash to cover the purchase, they can pay more if they choose to. If the buyer is funding the purchase from future cash flows (a seller-held note or a bank loan), the value of the business will be limited to how much can be funded from that cash flow, which will limit the company’s growth until the note or loan is substantially paid down. Since the vast majority of buyers try to fund their purchase from future cash flows, you need to understand how that valuation works.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="page36" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Economic Value</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">In my previous book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big</i> <i class="calibre8">Profits!</i>, I developed a formula to determine the economic value of a business. It blends both the profits and the capital in a business, and it has proven to be quite robust in bringing clarity to the value of a business. We have successfully used this formula for private company buy/sell agreements, stock awards, stock options, and phantom stock plans in situations when a value formula is needed instead of an appraised value.</p>
<p class="noindent">The formula was originally based on the common problem of how to buy out a 50% partner. I asked fellow entrepreneurs this question: how many years are you willing to give up all of the company’s after-tax profits to get your 50% partner out of your life? Many entrepreneurs who had never bought out a partner said two to three years. The ones who had bought out a partner said five years.</p>
<p class="noindent">Next I looked at multiple data sets to prove the math. The outcome was my valuation formula that employs a blend of profit and capital. I found that if a company is operating on a stable level of profit, you would take the last three years of pretax net income plus the equity (assets minus liabilities) at the date of the sale (see table 3.1).</p>
<p class="noindent">In table 3.1 the company is maintaining its profits around 10% and is retaining very little of the profits each year to add to equity. Since profitability is stable, it is more accurate to use the last three years as the net income period for evaluation than to use the most recent year times three. Had profitability been falling, the buyer might argue that you should take the most recent year times three, or weight the most recent year heavier than the previous two years, to establish the true value.</p>
<p class="text1a"><a id="page37" class="calibre4"></a><b class="calibre6">Table 3.1</b></p>
<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Economic value example</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="../images/00013.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Table 3.2 proves the math to buy out a 50% partner. In this scenario, the partner who is buying would have to use 100% of the after-tax profits for 51 months to complete the buyout. In most situations when I have used this calculation, the length of the payoff is from four to six years. This formula is a good starting point to help you determine if you should buy out a 50% partner when no outside cash is available.</p>
