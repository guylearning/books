<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">Replacement return example</h3>

<p class="imgc"><img src="../images/00017.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page51" class="calibre4"></a>Even though the return on invested capital (ROIC) is 67% in each column, you must consider the current value of the company, net of taxes, to calculate the replacement return. Emotional reasons to sell a business include retirement, fear about the future market, or the desire to sell to family or key employees. But from an economic point of view, you would need to get a replacement return between 13% and 27% at the three value points shown in table 4.1.</p>
<p class="noindent">I find that most entrepreneurs are reluctant to invest in the stock market and generally turn to real estate for alternative investments. My real estate clients indicate (and my own data confirms) that the expected yield for a real estate portfolio is between 8% and 15%, not considering unusual spikes in market values for property sales or lack of liquidity in down markets with tighter financing rules.</p>
<p class="noindent">Using replacement return to guide your thinking, if you have a sale offer for five times net income, you should sell only if you have another business idea for reinvesting the after-tax proceeds. Since a good business can yield 50% ROIC or more, reinvestment in another business is the only economic reason to sell at this price.</p>
<p class="noindent">A sale offer for seven times net income is beyond the high end of real estate returns, and you should sell only to reinvest in a better business or for emotional reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent">An economic green light occurs only when the replacement return is anywhere below 15%. You would pass on an offer at this level only if there are still significant growth opportunities for your business. A good time to exit is when you foresee more risk or effort to take advantage of those opportunities, typically when you need to expand your geographic reach and you would be forced to travel and be away from family, which is always a tough trade-off.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page52" class="calibre4"></a>When you start a business or reinvest for growth, use ROIC for decision making. When you consider selling a business, use replacement return to gain economic clarity. Since I developed this concept to help my clients think through keep-versus-sell decisions, it has helped them postpone sales discussions unless they can get a replacement return below 15%. It also helps them see their business more as an investment and lets them focus on enhancing profit and making their capital more efficient; these are the levers of ROIC, as we will see in Chapter 5.</p>
