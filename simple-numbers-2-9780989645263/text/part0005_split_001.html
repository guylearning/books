<p class="noindent1">Many entrepreneurs hear about companies that were sold and made them rich, and they get motivated to make the same thing happen for them. This can be a good thing if the entrepreneurâ€™s characteristics match those in the success story they heard, but unfortunately, most of the time they do not.
