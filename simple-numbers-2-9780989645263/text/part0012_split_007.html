<p class="noindent1">In the case study, ATSi invested heavily in educating their team members about gross margin, dLER, and contribution margin. <a id="page139" class="calibre4"></a>Although the company did not disclose everything, they shared the company’s goals and progress toward contribution margin targets as each year progressed. They established recognition of achievement bonuses that were paid when key targets were met, but they were not large amounts—just enough to reinforce the importance of hitting a target. The key point is that the CEO assumed responsibility for leading the training to prove the company was committed to the concept and was willing to explain and defend the strategy.</p>
