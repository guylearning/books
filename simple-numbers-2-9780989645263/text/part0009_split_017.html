<p class="noindent1">If your trade capital percentage to revenue is greater than your profit percentage to revenue, you can look for outside capital to help. The problem is that private equity firms are usually not interested unless they can deploy large amounts of investment with very predictable returns. They seem intrigued at first, especially if you utter the words “recurring revenue,” but they get nervous if you continue to chew through cash as you grow. In some cases an investor can take a recurring revenue stream and make a fixed yield on it, but those opportunities are hard to come by unless the revenue stream is a strong contract.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page74" class="calibre4"></a>Outside investors seem to be interested in funding launch capital spending to move the needle on your sales and bring it up to speed, where it requires less catalytic spending to keep the momentum going. If an investor is going to spin the roulette wheel of growth, it had better have a big upside—or at least your story should sell that idea!</p>
