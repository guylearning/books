<p class="noindent1">When the harvest to premium sale model applies, it is my favorite strategy because it gives you the best of both worlds: you can keep your business and grow it, or you can sell it and get a significant premium on the sale.</p>
<p class="noindent">The main characteristic of this business model is very sticky customers. They are either contractually bound, or it costs them a lot to go elsewhere. We see this primarily in subscription software sales. It is not impossible for customers to switch software platforms, but they will not endure the pain and suffering involved unless the current platform is unbearable or someone elseâ€™s offering is too good to pass up.</p>
<p class="noindent">Just because your customers are under contract with you does not guarantee a premium sale. In government contracting, you are generally given only the value of current contracts because there are no guaranteed renewals. However, you may be paid a premium if you are an approved vendor under a broad contract that allows only a handful of other vendors to provide products and services. In essence, the buyer is paying a premium for your government contract as a hunting license for task orders and thinks they can outbid the other limited vendors.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page15" class="calibre4"></a>Premiums are sometimes paid for highly skilled teams that are hard to assemble. When the hiring market is competitive and a company needs to move fast, they can buy a small company, with a nice premium, to get their labor. We have seen businesses with under $5 million in revenue be paid one times revenue to acquire their team, even if the business is operating at breakeven or a loss.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ability to scale up is another key characteristic of the harvest to premium sale model. You might create a business that could scale, but you do not have the energy or passion for it, or maybe you do not want to risk the capital. Private equity firms love to look at these types of businesses and are willing to pay a premium, if you hold them to it. Therefore, it is always a good idea to plan how to scale, even if you sell your business to someone else and they scale it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Recurring revenue is always a hot incentive for buyers to offer a premium, but there is a good side and a bad side to this. On the good side, when recurring revenue fits the product or service, it works great. On the bad side, when you try to force a recurring revenue model onto a business where it does not fit, you can damage a good business and significantly underprice your services.</p>
<p class="noindent">The most common recurring revenue models are in maintenance services, such as for homes (pest control; alarm systems; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning etc.) or for software or equipment. Many businesses that resell technical equipment find they can take a very low margin on the original sale of the equipment if they also sell a three-year maintenance agreement. As I said earlier, if you focus on gross margin instead of revenue, you can get creative with structuring sales to give up margin in some areas and make it up in others. In the capital cost of the transaction, do not forget to factor in how long you can wait to get paid and when you have to pay your costs.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page16" class="calibre4"></a>The most common error in recurring revenue is trying to turn an inconsistently needed service into a monthly fee. You might be successful at selling it the first time, but the customer will not renew because they did not get value from regularly paying for something they do not always need. The worst case is when you agree to a service level you cannot afford. Either there is no contractual exit for scope creep, or there is no clear definition of when the scope has been exceeded.</p>
