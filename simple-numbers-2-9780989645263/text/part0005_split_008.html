<p class="noindent1">Think of invested capital as money you put in. Debt is not invested capital; it is just a placeholder that must eventually be replaced with real capital. Sweat equity (working a job in the business at less than market wage) can be, and should be, considered invested capital. It is money you put in, but you did not account for it properly. So for our discussions, invested capital is money that the owners put in, plus sweat equity.</p>
<p class="scl"><a id="page26" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">Returns</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">If you buy a bond or certificate of deposit, there is a stated interest rate. Quite simply, what you get in interest is your return on what you invested, and your rate of return is the interest divided by what you originally invested. You can often renew a certificate of deposit and leave some or all of the interest in it for reinvestment. When you add the interest, it increases your original investment. Most of these calculations use pretax returns for evaluation.</p>
