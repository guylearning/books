<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_5"><b class="calibre5">Harvest to Premium Sale Example</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">This example is based on a product sales business. As in most businesses, it can be started with minimal capital (less than $20,000) and will build equity to $5 million by retaining some, but not all, profits each year. This business example is representative of what I call the “necessaries” type of business—nothing flashy or techie, just a well-run business providing what the market needs for a fair price and offering good customer service. The following are descriptions of the key characteristics:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Customer funded: No. </i>The company has to invoice its customers and carry inventory, although it gets some favorable vendor terms from its suppliers.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Recurring revenue: No. </i>The products they sell are consumable, so there is not a recurring supplies component.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">High use of labor: No. </i>Since the products they sell are manufactured on a contract basis, most labor is focused <a id="page21" class="calibre4"></a>on sales and customer service, with a high leverage to margin per labor dollar.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Sticky customers: Yes. </i>Even though there are competing products, this company’s products are used in a process that would be annoying for their customers to change. This helps drive a premium.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Perceived scalability: Moderate. </i>The company’s products are widely used, and scaling up could result from attracting large customers with high-volume needs and executing an effective sales process.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><i class="calibre8">Ability to create: Moderate. </i>The barrier is the capital need for initial setup and reaching initial sustainability. The products may have some patent protection, which helps boost the value, but most patents can be worked around, depending on your appetite for legal fees. The challenge is to win sticky customers who would need a reason to change suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Because of the sticky customers, perceived scalability, and ability to create, the sale of this business could attract a premium if the owner plays their cards right. By understanding what their business is worth, they could say no until a buyer offers a price that makes it worthwhile to sell, versus holding on until the next buyer comes along. When investor money is plentiful, the most common examples are roll-ups in industries like auto service, landscaping, equipment maintenance, and home services. Essentially, it is anything that has a recurring customer at a relatively fixed price for service that allows for gains from operational efficiency with size.</p>

<p class="noindent1">This example is based on a software subscription business. The vast majority of my software subscription clients have an eventual plan to sell their business. The speed of the process usually depends on whether they take outside funds or not. If they are profitable enough to fund their own development, I caution them to know when they are done.</p>
