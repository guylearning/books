<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_10"><b class="calibre5">Launch Capital</b></h2>
<p class="noindent1">I refer to launch capital as the magic pixie dust for scaling business. The magic comes from its elusiveness, buried in your financial data, and only entrepreneurial wizards who have a gut <a id="page67" class="calibre4"></a>for business know how to use it. My mission is to level the playing field for all entrepreneurs, so here is how to become a wizard.</p>
<p class="noindent">Simply speaking, launch capital is the operating losses you incur before a business activity becomes profitable. It is most easy to understand at initial launch, but it continues throughout the life of your business as you scale or respond to new competitive pressures of the market. This chapter discusses capital for initial launch, and Chapter 6 is all about launch capital during a growth phase.</p>
<p class="noindent">When I gave a speech to a group of entrepreneurs, a successful business owner whom I will call Bob was in attendance. I did not know his numbers, but I had been told he was a great businessman who had 15 auto service stores, and he was a good mentor to the group. Bob consented to let me use him as an example of the ROIC concept and let me see how good my guesses were!</p>
<p class="noindent">I said, “Bob, my guess is that it will cost you about $1 million for the dirt and the metal building to put up a new store.” He agreed, and I continued: “The bank will finance 80%, so you will need $200,000 of your own money to put down.” He agreed again. “Once the building is complete, you will have about $200,000 of opening costs and operating losses to cover until the store breaks even.” Bob paused, smiled, and said, “Yep, that is exactly what we budget.” I continued with the final piece: “Your go/no go decision for this location will be based on whether you think there is enough traffic to get this store to produce at $200,000 net profit run rate within 12 to 24 months. It will take you the first 12 months to get going, but you should get to at least $200,000, an average of $16,666 per month, by the twelfth month or sooner, but no later than 24 months.” After I finished, Bob gave me one of the best compliments I have ever received: “What you just told me in two minutes took me 20 years to figure out!” Bob is a business wizard. He does not need accountants to tell him how to run a business; they only need to handle his <a id="page68" class="calibre4"></a>compliance work and provide data to other people because he knows his numbers in his gut. I hope these concepts help passionate entrepreneurs who do not have a gut for numbers build successful businesses.</p>
<p class="noindent">The two parts that entrepreneurs miss are correctly calculating the launch capital needed for start-up costs and the operating losses they need to cover until they break even. The operating losses require capital, just like buildings and equipment; but they are accounted for on the profit and loss statement, not on the balance sheet. To effectively see this requires a nonstandard presentation of financials to first predict the losses, then to measure your return for making that investment. It is also easy for entrepreneurs to predict the best-case scenario and not be prepared for the worst case.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Several years ago we had a client who needed to open new offices in other cities to grow their respiratory care business. We correctly estimated that they would have $150,000 of launch capital invested before the location would break even. They launched the first location and were about $60,000 into it when they realized the political alignments of the needed referral sources were not likely to make this location a success. They abandoned the office and got out of their lease. (Fortunately, they negotiated a reasonable up-front penalty in case they needed to leave.)</p>
<p class="noindent">They picked the next city and tried again. The same issues came up when they were about $75,000 into it, and once again they pulled out. The third location worked out. The <a id="page69" class="calibre15"></a>new office was profitable well before the $150,000 was spent. That location produced over $750,000 of profit annually for several years, making it a great return on investment even if you include the two misses.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is what business is all about. You may realize by now that growing a business is really running a legal gambling enterprise! You need a high return because the risk of failure is real. If you take the return potential out of business (including higher taxes), failures increase and investors look for other places to put their money and effort. Learn to make good bets and cut losses quickly to save your cash for another try.</p>
