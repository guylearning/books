<p class="center">– Anonymous</p>
<p class="noindent1a">The quote above is so true in my case. This book is just another stage of seeing farther than I could have ever imagined. As I looked at the data of many businesses through the lens of my previous book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits! </i>(2011), my process continued to evolve as I searched for financial truth through Simple Numbers.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2014 I was honored to contribute to Verne Harnish’s book, <i class="calibre8">Scaling Up</i>. It gave me an opportunity to share some of my latest thinking on how to manage profitability through labor efficiency. I showed an example of a common technique I use to isolate components of labor and hold them accountable to an output measure.</p>
<p class="noindent">Through my consulting practice, my team continues to see many companies plagued by bad data that is provided late to the business owner. The accountant thinks they must get it right, which is a noble thought, but it leads to rigid rules that are difficult to apply; and by the time the data is released, its value for analytics has long passed. Business owners dream about timely, useful data. My consulting team delivers it to them, and we train their staff on how to repeatedly provide it.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page2" class="calibre4"></a>I was fortunate to have some great entrepreneurs as clients, and my fellow Entrepreneurs’ Organization forum members taught me how accountants should work with them. Accounting standards are needed, but there is a whole world of alternative data presentation methods that often produce better financial truth for running a business. It is my job to provide both data sets: one for running the business, and one for banks and other external data users. But an interesting thing is happening. Once the banks and other users see the alternative data we prepare, they stop asking for traditional presentations and use just the management view (with proper disclosure on how it differs).</p>
<p class="noindent">As our work started to significantly improve companies’ profitability, it opened up more possibilities for them to scale up, and it led me to look not at just profitability, but also, and more importantly, at return on invested capital as the number one key to focus on. In 2016 I was asked to chair an executive education program for the Entrepreneurs’ Organization that was held at the Wharton School, which is the business school at the University of Pennsylvania. The school’s director of executive education, David Wessels, is an expert on return on invested capital concepts. Hearing Professor Wessels teach on this topic helped me formulate my own ideas about how return on invested capital applies to private companies. I then developed models to evaluate new business investments, and I created a new way to monitor performance and return on investment.</p>
<p class="noindent">As entrepreneurs learn to view their business as an investment vehicle that must provide a return to their investor, they see the enormous power of a privately held business to realize 50% to 100% returns from their invested capital, year, over year, without selling the business. This is why significant wealth can be created from owning a business if (a) you possess the skill to lead it, (b) you have the capital to launch it, and (c) you have the discipline to leave the after-tax profits in it to grow.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page3" class="calibre4"></a>This book is designed to give business owners and their teams the necessary understanding to scale smartly, know when to reinvest profits, and know when to harvest profits for other opportunities. By following the principles I outline in this book, you will have the tools needed to create a valuable, profitable business that will reap great financial reward, whether you keep it or sell it.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is my hope this book will let you dream farther, and see farther still once you get there.<a id="page4" class="calibre4"></a></p>
