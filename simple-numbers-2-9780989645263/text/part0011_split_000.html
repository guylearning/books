<p class="center">– Greg Crabtree</p>
<p class="noindent1a">Throughout my accounting career, I always cringed at the sound of the word “budget.” It probably goes all the way back to growing up on the farm. My mom was the finance person, and my dad was the farmer. I do not remember my mom ever keeping a budget, but she always had a plan for how to build and move forward. Her plan even factored into how she sent me to college. I had a checkbook with no balance written in, just an instruction for me to spend only what I needed. When I came home every two weeks, I would transfer the checks I wrote into her checkbook and account for my actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">This technique may not work for every college student. Even though my mom weighed only 100 pounds and had red hair and freckles, I did not want to get her mad, and I also wanted to earn her respect by being responsible. I often say that budgets are a license to spend and that planning and forecasts are tools of growth and profitability. In Chapter 10 I will explain my alternative process for budgeting.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page97" class="calibre4"></a>Our planning process always starts with establishing a target. A target is one specifically defined goal you want to reach. In contrast, a forecast is when you plan ahead and predict a course. Planning processes usually fall short in one of these two ways:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">You make a plan for the year but do not take into account the ramping effect of what you are currently doing. If your plan is to increase sales by 10%, it will take time to reach that number as your new sales initiatives roll out. You might fall short of 10% in the first half of the year, so your sales will have to increase by 12% to 15% in the last half of the year to average out to 10% overall. If you do not consider ramp-up time, you will be constantly disappointed in your planning.</li>
<li class="calibre11">You build your plan for the year on a monthly incremental basis, but you miss the bigger opportunity of stopping activities that are unproductive because you are always thinking in increments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">You can negate these shortcomings if you first establish a target you want to attain within one to two years and then build a forecast to get there. Do not be bound by calendar or fiscal years; give yourself the freedom of the rolling 12 view. Once you establish a picture of what you want your target to look like, you can build a weekly, monthly, and quarterly plan for how to get from here to there. If this is January and it will take 15 months to reach your target, then your rolling 12 around March of next year will tell you if your forecast hit your target. If you can hit your target sooner, great! If it takes longer, that is fine as long as your plan is still realistic and still takes you where you want to go.</p>
<p class="secl"><a id="page98" class="calibre7"></a><b class="calibre5">The Forecasting and Targeting Process</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Over the years I have seen that the forecast models developed by our clients, or by other consultants, are usually lacking in one or more of these areas:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Forecast has too many details and levels.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Forecast accounts for only profit and loss.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Forecast time period is based on a year and is not rolling.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Model does not allow for easy updating throughout the year.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In addition, the balance sheet and cash flow report need to accomplish the following:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">Reasonably predict accounts receivable, inventory (if applicable), accounts payable, term debt repayment, automatic withdrawals, and repayment of line of credit.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Plan for quarterly estimated tax payments (for US businesses) or plan for taxes and a payment schedule (for international businesses).</li>
<li class="calibre11">Plan for any shareholder dividends payments expected or driven from meeting performance goals.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">When we create our custom forecasting model for our clients, we make sure it can be updated with minimal effort by incorporating the following:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">We store the source data on one tab.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page99" class="calibre4"></a>Any presentation of data needed is on a separate tab that pulls from the source data, to avoid having to input data on the presentation tab.</li>
<li class="calibre11">We do not use blank columns as spacers because they make it harder to copy data to the next column during updating.</li>
<li class="calibre11">The current month of actual data can be dropped in and rolled forward with every month end close.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">My favorite tab we use in our model is aptly named the Thinking Model. Not only is this worksheet useful to set performance targets, but it is also a good tool for exploring what-if scenarios; setting minimum, target, and stretch performance levels; and verifying that if any new revenue growth occurs, it benefits the bottom line.</p>
