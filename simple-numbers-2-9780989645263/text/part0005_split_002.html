<p class="noindent1">Run to harvest is the most common business model among privately held businesses, and it has made many entrepreneurs significantly wealthy. When this type of business is run at its best, it can be very profitable, but it may be operationally difficult to scale. It usually does not have recurring revenue streams for any great length of time. Customers may be loyal, or “sticky,” but only to the owner or a key staff member.</p>
<p class="noindent">This type of business also struggles to exceed much more than $5 million in revenue, which keeps it below the target of private equity funds as a purchase target. As a rule, this type of business attracts only four to five times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) as a sale value, and much of that is subject to an earnout because of the perceived lack of stickiness of the customers and the difficulty of continued operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">While those may seem like negatives, business owners who have this type of business might still achieve significant wealth creation if they follow the principles outlined in my first book, <i class="calibre8">Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits! </i>It is imperative that business owners pay themselves a market wage for their role in <a id="page14" class="calibre4"></a>the business (it is okay if that wage is at the top of the market), and they must use the after-tax profits of the business to smartly grow it as the market allows. Once the business has grown as far as the market allows, business owners should use the after-tax profits to diversify into other investments (such as another business, real estate, or the stock market). If you run your business on these principles, it will give you a better investment return than anything in real estate or the stock market, so be sure to fully capitalize your business before you do anything else with the profits.</p>
