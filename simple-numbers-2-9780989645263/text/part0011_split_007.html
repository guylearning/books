<p class="text"><i class="calibre8"><span class="blu">Capital calculations and ROIC for minimum, target, and stretch levels</span></i></p>
<p class="imgc"><img src="../images/00031.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page118" class="calibre4"></a>You can see that the company is meeting my minimum ROIC standard of 50% at all three levels of their plan, ranging from 74% to 90%. Why would you not keep enough cash in this business to protect an <i class="calibre8">annual </i>return of 74% to 90%? The tricky part is whether this business is growing at those return levels without taking too much risk. Owning your own business and effectively balancing its growth and profit strategies is one of the best ways to build wealth, but there is nothing easy or automatic about it!</p>
<p class="secl"><b class="calibre5">Leveraging $1 of Management Labor</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">When we complete a targeting session, the last thing I bring into focus for the client’s management team is how much revenue they need to add for every added dollar of management labor. Most companies fixate on the leverage of their direct labor, which is important; but the leverage on management labor separates great businesses from the rest.</p>
<p class="noindent">To illustrate this point, let’s go back to our example company and three key metrics from the target level (table 7.3).</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">mLER is $4.00.</li>
<li class="calibre11">dLER is $3.10.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Gross margin as a percentage to sales is 30%.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Now we can make the following calculation:</p>

<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre11">$1 of management labor times mLER is $4.00 of contribution margin.</li>
<li class="calibre11">$4 of contribution margin divided by (dLER minus 1) is $1.90 of direct labor.<br class="calibre9"/><br class="calibre9"/><b class="calibre6">$4 / ($3.10 – 1) = $1.90</b></li>
<li class="calibre11"><a id="page119" class="calibre4"></a>Contribution margin of $4 plus direct labor of $1.90 is $5.90 of gross margin.</li>
<li class="calibre11">Gross margin of $5.90 divided by 30% is $19.66!</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">For every dollar of management labor added in this business (a raise, a bonus, or a new body), the company will need to add $19.66 of revenue to stay at the same rate of profitability, given that the key metrics stay the same.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is an example of how the term “scaling” is often misapplied. In some businesses, the founder thinks that costs will stay constant or go down as the business grows. While this can be true up to $5 million in revenue, it is rarely true past that level except in a few rare business models. More commonly, you lose margin as you grow and have to compete with the major market players. ROIC is what scales; it gets better as you grow because most elements of your capital signature get more efficient if they are managed properly. Scaling is more about market penetration than improved margins with growth. If your operating margins get better as you surpass $5 million, you are in a special class.</p>
<p class="noindent">The example company in this chapter has a low gross margin (i.e., 40% or below), and recall that I look at gross margin as the true top line of the business for this level of gross margin. You can see that it takes almost $6 of gross margin for every dollar of added management labor. I have done this calculation countless times. For businesses with a higher gross margin, it comes out in a range of $6 to $10 for revenue. If the company’s gross margin is below 40%, it hits the same range for gross margin dollars. It always shocks people to see this, and it gives them a new perspective on why they need to hold management more accountable to deliver contribution margin, not just revenue.</p>
