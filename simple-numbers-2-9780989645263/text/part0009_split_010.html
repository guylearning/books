<p class="noindent1">In his book <i class="calibre8">Fooled by Randomness</i>, Nassim Nicholas Taleb says that trusting the market is like playing Russian roulette for $100,000 per pull. You might get lucky and get ahead by $1 million, but eventually you die. This is how debt goes bad. You go to the well once too often, and that final push takes you down.</p>

<p class="noindent">Over my years of monitoring the cash standard, I have seen a few businesses struggle to maintain two months of cash and meet the ROIC standard. Staffing companies are a great example. We have several clients in this industry, and many have to rely on factoring invoices to manage cash flow. However, one client faced the challenge by asking for, and receiving, up-front payments. Sometimes you just have to ask! Some markets will not allow this, but be creative. Bill quickly, bill often, and if you can get either a deposit or a retainer, you will significantly lower your capital requirement and boost your ROIC.</p>
