      <p class="calibre2"><span>L</span>et’s take a model of management. There are hundreds of them, dating back at least to the Scientific Theory of Management by Frederick Taylor, which had factory managers breaking down tasks into small pieces, forcing their workers to specialize, and financially incentivizing them to complete those tasks efficiently. It was a brute force method, but it worked pretty well.</p>

      <p class="archer">As time went on and the economy increasingly moved away from manufacturing, other theories gained popularity, and Taylor’s scientific model is no longer used by anyone of note. That does not mean it wasn’t useful: For a time, it was. It’s just that reality is more complicated than Taylor’s model. It had to contend with at least the following factors:</p>

      <ol class="pull_list">
        <li value="1" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">As more and more people know what model you’re using to manipulate them, they may decide not to respond to your incentives.</p></li>

        <li value="2" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">As your competitors gain knowledge of the model, they respond in kind by adopting the model themselves, thus flattening the field.</p></li>

        <li value="3" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">The model may have been mostly useful in a factory setting, and not in an office setting, or a technology setting.</p></li>

        <li value="4" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">Human beings are not simple automatons: A more complete model would hone in on other motivations they might have besides financial ones.</p></li>
      </ol>

      <p class="archer2">And so on. Clearly, though Taylor’s model was effective for a time, it was effective with limitations. As with Einstein eclipsing Newton, better models came along in time.</p>
