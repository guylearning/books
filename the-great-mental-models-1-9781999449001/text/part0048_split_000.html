    <h1 class="headings" id="calibre_pb_0">Occam’s Razor</h1>

    <p class="calibre2">Simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones. This is the essence of Occam’s Razor, a classic principle of logic and problem-solving. Instead of wasting your time trying to disprove complex scenarios, you can make decisions more confidently by basing them on the explanation that has the fewest moving parts.</p>

    <p class="body">We all jump to overly complex explanations about something. Husband late getting home? What if he’s been in a car accident? Son grew a centimeter less than he did last year? What if there is something wrong with him? Your toe hurts? What if you have bone cancer? Although it is possible that any of these worst case scenarios could be true, without any other correlating factors, it is significantly more likely that your husband got caught up at work, you mismeasured your son, and your shoe is too tight.</p>

    <p class="body">We often spend lots of time coming up with very complicated narratives to explain what we see around us. From the behavior of people on the street to physical phenomena, we get caught up in assuming vast icebergs of meaning beyond the tips that we observe. This is a common human tendency, and it serves us well in some situations, such as creating art. However, complexity takes work to unravel, manage, and understand. Occam’s Razor is a great tool for avoiding unnecessary complexity by helping you identify and commit to the simplest explanation possible.</p>

    <p class="body">Named after the medieval logician William of Ockham, Occam’s Razor is a general rule by which we select among competing explanations. Ockham wrote that “a plurality is not to be posited without necessity”—essentially that we should prefer the simplest explanation with the fewest moving parts.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-2" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-2" class="calibre5">2</a></span><span class="footnote_ref2">,</span><span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-3" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-3" class="calibre5">3</a></span> They are easier to falsify, easier to understand, and generally more likely to be correct. Occam’s Razor is not an iron law but a tendency and a mind-frame you can choose to use: If all else is equal, that is if two competing models both have equal explanatory power, it’s more likely that the simple solution suffices.</p>

    <p class="body">Of course, it’s unlikely that Ockham himself derived the idea. It had been in use since antiquity. Nor was Ockham the last to note the value of simplicity. The principle was stated in another useful way by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher David Hume, in his famous <em class="italic">Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</em><em class="italic">. </em>Writing about the truth or untruth of miracles, Hume stated that we should default to skepticism about them.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-4" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-4" class="calibre5">4</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">Why? It wasn’t simply that Hume was a buzzkill. He had a specific, Occam-like reason for being cautious about miracles. By definition, a miracle is something which has happened outside of our normal understanding of the way nature works. If the miracle was not outside of our common experience, we wouldn’t consider its occurrence miraculous. If there was a simple explanation for the occurrence based on mostly common knowledge, we likely wouldn’t pay much attention to it at all.</p>

    <p class="body">Therefore, the most simple explanation for a miracle is that the miracle-witnesser is not describing the event correctly, or the miracle represents a more common phenomenon that we currently don’t properly understand. As scientist and writer Carl Sagan explains in <em class="italic">The Demon Haunted World</em>,</p>

    <p class="body1"><em class="italic">A multitude of aspects of the natural world that were considered miraculous only a few generations ago are now thoroughly understood in terms of physics and chemistry. At least some of the mysteries of today will be comprehensively solved by our descendants. The fact that we cannot now produce a detailed understanding of, say, altered states of consciousness in terms of brain chemistry no more implies the existence of a ‘spirit world’ than a sunflower following the Sun in its course across the sky was evidence of a literal miracle before we knew about phototropism and plant hormones.</em><span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-5" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-5" class="calibre5">5</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">The simpler explanation for a miracle is that there are principles of nature being exploited that we do not understand. This is Hume’s and Sagan’s point.</p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">Dark what?</p>

    <p class="calibre2">In the mid-1970s astronomer Vera Rubin had a very interesting problem. She had a bunch of data about the behavior of galaxies piling up that wasn’t explained by contemporary theories.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-6" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-6" class="calibre5">6</a></span><span class="footnote_ref2">,</span><span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-7" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-7" class="calibre5">7</a></span><span class="footnote_ref2">,</span><span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-8" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-8" class="calibre5">8</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">Rubin had been observing the behavior of the Andromeda Galaxy, and had noticed something very strange. As explained in an article on <a href="http://Astronomy.com" class="calibre3">Astronomy.com</a>, “the vast spiral seemed to be rotating all wrong. The stuff at the edges was moving just as fast as the stuff near the center, apparently violating Newton’s Laws of Motion (which also govern how the planets move around our Sun).” This didn’t make any sense. Gravity should exert less pull on distant objects, which should move slower. But Rubin was observing something entirely different.</p>

    <p class="body">One possible explanation was something that had been theorized as far back as 1933, by Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky, who coined the phrase “dark matter” to describe a mass we couldn’t see, but which was influencing the behavior of the orbits in the galaxies. Dark matter became the simplest explanation for the observed phenomenon, and Vera Rubin has been credited with providing the first evidence of its existence. What is particularly interesting is that to this day no one has ever actually discovered dark matter.</p>

    <p class="body">Why are more complicated explanations less likely to be true? Let’s work it out mathematically. Take two competing explanations, each of which seem to equally explain a given phenomenon. If one of them requires the interaction of three variables and the other the interaction of thirty variables, all of which <em class="italic">must</em><em class="italic"> </em>have occurred to arrive at the stated conclusion, which of these is more likely to be in error? If each variable has a 99% chance of being correct, the first explanation is only 3% likely to be wrong. The second, more complex explanation, is about nine times as likely to be wrong, or 26%. The simpler explanation is more robust in the face of uncertainty.</p>

      <p class="captions"><span>_</span><br class="calibre1"/>It was Rubin’s observations of the Andromeda galaxy that led to her to collect the first evidence in support of the theory of dark matter—a substance that does not emit energy or light.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="body">Dark matter is an excellent theory with a lot of explanatory power. As Lisa Randall explains in <em class="italic">Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs</em>, measurements of dark matter so far fit in exactly with what we understand about the Universe. Although we can’t see it, we can make predictions based on our understanding of it, and test those predictions. She writes, “It would be even more mysterious to me if the matter we can see with our eyes is all the matter that exists.”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-9" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-9" class="calibre5">9</a></span> Dark matter is currently the simplest explanation for certain phenomena we observe in the Universe. The great thing about science, however, is that it continually seeks to validate its assumptions.</p>

    <p class="body">Sagan wrote that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-10" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-10" class="calibre5">10</a></span> He dedicated much ink to a rational investigation of extraordinary claims. He felt most, or nearly all, were susceptible to simpler and more parsimonious explanations. UFOs, paranormal activity, telepathy, and a hundred other seemingly mystifying occurrences could be better explained with a few simple real world variables. And as Hume suggested, if they couldn’t, it was a lot more likely that we needed to update our understanding of the world than that a miracle had occurred.</p>

    <p class="body">And so, dark matter remains, right now, the simplest explanation for the peculiar behavior of galaxies. Scientists, however, continue to try to conclusively discover dark matter and thus try to determine if our understanding of the world is correct. If dark matter eventually becomes too complicated an explanation, it could be that the data describes something we don’t yet understand about the universe. We can then apply Occam’s Razor to update to what is the simplest, and thus easiest to verify, explanation. Vera Rubin herself, after noting that scientists always felt like they were ten years away from discovering dark matter without ever closing the gap, was described in an interview as thinking, “The longer that dark matter went undetected, … the more likely she thought the solution to the mystery would be a modification to our understanding of gravity.”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-11" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-11" class="calibre5">11</a></span> This claim, demanding a total overhaul of our established theories of gravity, would correspondingly require extraordinary proof!</p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">Simplicity can increase efficiency</p>

    <p class="calibre2">With limited time and resources, it is not possible to track down every theory with a plausible explanation of a complex, uncertain event. Without the filter of Occam’s Razor, we are stuck chasing down dead ends. We waste time, resources, and energy.</p>

    <p class="body">The great thing about simplicity is that it can be so powerful. Sometimes unnecessary complexity just papers over the systemic flaws that will eventually choke us. Opting for the simple helps us make decisions based on how things really are. Here are two short examples of those who got waylaid chasing down complicated solutions when simple ones were most effective.</p>

    <p class="body">The ten-acre Ivanhoe Reservoir in Los Angeles provides drinking water for over 600,000 people. Its nearly 60 million gallons of water are disinfected with chlorine, as is common practice.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-12" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-12" class="calibre5">12</a></span> Ground water often contains elevated levels of a chemical called bromide. When chlorine and bromide mix, then are exposed to sunlight, they create a dangerous carcinogen called bromate.</p>

    <p class="body">In order to avoid poisoning the water supply, the L.A. Department of Water and Power (DWP) needed a way to shade the water’s surface. Brainstorming sessions had yielded only two infeasible solutions, building either a ten-acre tarp or a huge retractable dome over the reservoir. Then a DWP biologist suggested using “bird balls,” the floating balls that airports use to keep birds from congregating near runways. They require no construction, no parts, no labor, no maintenance, and cost US$0.40 each. Three million UV-deflecting black balls were then deployed in Ivanhoe and other LA reservoirs, a simple solution to a potentially serious problem.</p>
