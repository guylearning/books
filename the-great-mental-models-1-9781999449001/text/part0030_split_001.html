      <h2 class="serif_title" id="calibre_pb_3">The Trolley Experiment</h2>

      <p class="calibre2"><span>T</span>hought experiments are often used to explore ethical and moral issues. When you are dealing with questions of life and death it is obviously not recommended to kill a bunch of people in order to determine the most ethical course of action. This then is where a thought experiment is also extremely valuable.</p>

      <p class="archer">One of the most famous of this type is the trolley experiment. It goes like this: say you are the driver of a trolley that is out of control. You apply the brakes and nothing happens. Ahead of you are five people who will die should your trolley continue on the track. At the last moment you notice a spur that has one person on it. What do you do? Do you continue on and kill the five, or do you divert and kill the one?</p>

      <p class="archer">This experiment was first proposed in modern form by Philippa Foot in her paper “The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect,”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch4-3" href="part0055.html#ch4-link-3" class="calibre5">3</a></span> and further considered extensively by Judith Jarvis Thomson in “The Trolley Problem.”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch4-4" href="part0055.html#ch4-link-4" class="calibre5">4</a></span> In both cases the value of the thought experiment is clear. The authors were able to explore situations that would be physically impossible to reproduce without causing serious harm, and in so doing significantly advanced certain questions of morality. Moreover, the trolley problem remains relevant to this day as technological advances often ask us to define when it is acceptable, and even desirable, to sacrifice one to save many (and lest you think this is always the case, Thomson conducts another great thought experiment considering a doctor killing one patient to save five through organ donation).</p>

    <p class="body">To understand it, let’s think about another chaotic system we’re all familiar with, the weather. Why is it that we can predict the movement of the stars but we can’t predict the weather more than a few weeks out, and even that is not altogether reliable?</p>

    <p class="body">It’s because weather is highly chaotic. Any infinitesimally small error in our calculations today will change the result down the line, as rapid feedback loops occur throughout time. Since our measurement tools are not infinitely accurate, and never will be, we are stuck with the unpredictability of chaotic systems.</p>

    <p class="body">And compared to human systems, one could say weather is pretty reliable stuff. As anyone who’s seen <em class="italic">Back to the Future</em><em class="italic"> </em>knows, a small change in the past could have a massive, unpredictable effect on the future. Thus, running historical counter-factuals is an easy way to accidentally mislead yourself. We simply don’t know what else would have occurred had Cleopatra not met Caesar or had you not been stuck at that airport. The potential outcomes are too chaotic.</p>

    <p class="body">But we can use thought experiments to <em class="italic">explore</em> unrealized outcomes—to re-run a process as many times as we like to see what could have occurred, and learn more about the limits we have to work with.</p>

    <p class="body">The truth is, the events that have happened in history are but one realization of the historical process—one possible outcome among a large variety of possible outcomes. They’re like a deck of cards that has been dealt out only one time. All the things that didn’t happen, but could have if some little thing went another way, are invisible to us. That is, until we use our brains to generate these theoretical worlds via thought experiments.</p>

    <p class="body">If we can also factor in the approximate probability of these occurrences, relative to the scope of possible ones, we can learn what the most likely outcomes are. Sometimes it is easy to imagine ten different ways a situation could have played out differently, but more of a stretch to change the variables and still end up with the same thing.</p>

    <p class="body">So let’s try it. First, we have to ask a question. What if Serbian Gavrilo Princip hadn’t shot Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand? That single act has often been credited with launching World War I, so it is a question worth asking. If we conclude the assassination started a chain reaction for which war was the inevitable result, it would certainly tell us a lot about certain causal relationships in politics, diplomacy, and possibly human psychology.</p>

    <p class="body">Then we need to do our background research: What do we need to know to be able to answer this question? So we look into it—treaties, conflicts, alliances, interests, personalities—enough to be able to formulate an hypothesis.</p>

    <p class="body">An immediate response to the assassination was on June 30, 1914, two days later. Austria changed its policy toward Serbia. Shortly after that Germany offered full military support to Austria, and less than two months later the world was at war. Thus, a next step in our thought experiment might be to refine the question. Something like, how did Princip’s assassination of the Archduke influence Austrian policy toward Serbia?</p>

    <p class="body">Our hypothesis could be one of the following:</p>

    <ol class="calibre9">
      <li value="1" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">The assassination had no effect on the policy</p></li>

      <li value="2" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">The assassination had partial effect on the policy</p></li>

      <li value="3" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">The assassination had total effect on the policy</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p class="sp">To test any one of these, we run the experiment in our heads. We sit back and think about what the world looked like in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. The Archduke and his wife being chauffeured in their car, Gavrilo Princip cleaning his gun somewhere. Now we imagine Princip gets stomach cramps from some bad food the night before. The Archduke’s car makes it to its destination while Princip is curled up in bed. The Archduke gives a speech, emphasizing peace. One of Princip’s gang tries to assassinate the Archduke, but fails. How does Austria react? Is it demonstrably different from what they actually did?</p>

    <div class="partialimg">
      <img alt="" class="partial_img" src="../images/00026.jpeg"/> 

      <p class="captions"><span>_</span><br class="calibre1"/>What we think of as an inevitable occurrence could have played out in many ways: Earlier on the day of the assassination, Archduke Ferdinand and his wife Sophie survived a grenade being detonated by their car. It was on the way to visit those injured, an unplanned change of schedule, that Princip got his opportunity.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="body">Princip wasn’t a lone wolf, and there was a lot of unrest in Serbia towards Austria. How could the situation be changed to lead to different Austrian policy? Given the climate at the time, is our hypothetical situation realistic? Meaning, can you construct an historically accurate scenario in which no events come to pass that prompt Austria’s policy change? How many Serbians would have to get the stomach flu?</p>

    <p class="body">One of the goals of a thought experiment like this is to understand the situation enough to identify the decisions and actions that had impact. This process doesn’t provide definitive answers, such as whether the assassination did, or did not, cause World War I. What you are trying to get to is a rough idea of how much it may have contributed to starting the war. The more scenarios you can imagine where war comes to pass without the assassination, the weaker the case for it being the critical cause. Thus, by exploring the realistic relationships between events you can better understand the most likely effects of any one decision. <span class="sidebar_marker1">— Sidebar: Reduce the Role of Chance</span></p>

    <p class="sp"><span class="akkurat_regular">Intuiting the non-intuitive:</span> One of the uses of thought experiments is to improve our ability to intuit the non-intuitive. In other words, a thought experiment allows us to verify if our natural intuition is correct by running experiments in our deliberate, conscious minds that make a point clear.</p>
