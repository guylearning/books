      <h2 class="serif_title" id="calibre_pb_3">The Tragedy of the Commons</h2>

      <p class="calibre2"><span>T</span>he Tragedy of the Commons is a parable that illustrates why common resources get used more than is desirable from the standpoint of society as a whole. Garrett Hardin wrote extensively about this concept.</p>

      <p class="archer">“Picture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons. Such an arrangement may work reasonably satisfactorily for centuries because tribal wars, poaching, and disease keep the numbers of both man and beast well below the carrying capacity of the land. Finally, however, comes the day of reckoning, that is, the day when the long-desired goal of social stability becomes a reality. At this point, the inherent logic of the commons remorselessly generates tragedy.</p>

      <p class="archer">As a rational being, each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he asks, “What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?” This utility has one negative and one positive component.</p>

      <ol class="pull_list">
        <li value="1" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the herdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the positive utility is nearly +1.</p></li>

        <li value="2" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by one more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the herdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only a fraction of 1.</p></li>
      </ol>

      <p class="archer">Adding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. And another; and another. . . . But this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit—in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.” <span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch1-3" href="part0055.html#ch1-link-3" class="calibre5">3</a></span></p>

      <p class="archer_quote">What is common to many is taken least care of, for all men have greater regard for what is their own than for what they possess in common with others. –Aristotle</p>

    <p class="sp">Here’s another way to think about it. Economist Elinor Ostrom wrote about being cautious with maps and models when looking at different governance structures for common resources. She was worried that the Tragedy of the Commons model (see sidebar), which shows how a shared resource can become destroyed through bad incentives, was too general and did not account for how people, in reality, solved the problem. She explained the limitations of using models to guide public policy, namely that they often become metaphors.</p>

    <p class="body1"><em class="italic">“What makes these models so dangerous … is that the constraints that are assumed to be fixed for the purpose of analysis are taken on faith as being fixed in empirical setting.</em><em class="italic">”</em><span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch1-4" href="part0055.html#ch1-link-4" class="calibre5">4</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">This is a double problem. First, having a general map, we may assume that if a territory matches the map in a couple of respects it matches the map in all respects. Second, we may think adherence to the map is more important than taking in new information about a territory. Ostrom asserts that one of the main values of using models as maps in public policy discussions is in the thinking that is generated. They are tools for exploration, not doctrines to force conformity. They are guidebooks, not laws.</p>

    <p class="center_quote">«Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.»<br class="calibre1"/><span class="attribution">George Box<span class="footnote_ref"><a id="ch1-5" href="part0055.html#ch1-link-5" class="calibre5">5</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="sp">In order to use a map or model as accurately as possible, we should take three important considerations into account:</p>

    <ol class="akkurat_regular3">
      <li value="1" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Reality is the ultimate update.</span></p></li>

      <li value="2" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Consider the cartographer.</span></p></li>

      <li value="3" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Maps can influence territories.</span></p></li>
    </ol>

    <p class="sp"><span class="akkurat_regular">Reality is the ultimate update: </span>When we enter new and unfamiliar territory it’s nice to have a map on hand. Everything from travelling to a new city, to becoming a parent for the first time has maps that we can use to improve our ability to navigate the terrain. But territories change, sometimes faster than the maps and models that describe them. We can and should update them based on our own experiences in the territory. That’s how good maps are built: feedback loops created by explorers.</p>

    <p class="body">We can think of stereotypes as maps. Sometimes they are useful—we have to process large amounts of information every day, and simplified chunks such as stereotypes can help us sort through this information with efficiency. The danger is when, like with all maps, we forget the territory is more complex. That people have far more territory than a stereotype can represent.</p>

    <p class="body">In the early 1900s, Europeans were snapping pictures all over Palestine, leaving a record that may have reflected their ethnographic perspective, but did not cover Karimeh Abbud’s perception of her culture. She began to take photos of those around her, becoming the first female Arab to set up her own photo studio in Palestine. Her pictures reflected a different take on the territory—she rejected the European style and aimed to capture the middle class as they were. She tried to let her camera record the territory as she saw it versus manipulating the images to follow a narrative.</p>

    <p class="body">Her informal style and desire to photograph the variety around her, from landscapes to intimate portraits, have left a legacy far beyond the photos themselves.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch1-6" href="part0055.html#ch1-link-6" class="calibre5">6</a></span><span class="footnote_ref2">,</span><span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch1-7" href="part0055.html#ch1-link-7" class="calibre5">7</a></span> She contributed a different perspective, a new map, with which to explore the history of the territory of Palestine.</p>

    <p class="body">We do have to remember though, that a map captures a territory at a moment in time. Just because it might have done a good job at depicting what was, there is no guarantee that it depicts what is there now or what will be there in the future. The faster the rate of change in the territory, the harder it will be for a map to keep up to date.</p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="akkurat_regular">Consider the cartographer:</span> Maps are not purely objective creations. They reflect the values, standards, and limitations of their creators. We can see this in the changing national boundaries that make up our world maps. Countries come and go depending on shifting political and cultural sensibilities. When we look at the world map we have today, we tend to associate societies with nations, assuming that the borders reflect a common identity shared by everyone contained within them.</p>

    <p class="body">However, as historian Margaret MacMillan has pointed out, nationalism is a very modern construct, and in some sense has developed with, not in advance of, the maps that set out the shape of countries.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch1-9" href="part0055.html#ch1-link-9" class="calibre5">9</a></span> We then should not assume that our literal maps depict an objective view of the geographical territory. For example, historians have shown that the modern borders of Syria, Jordan, and Iraq reflect British and French determination to maintain influence in the Middle East after World War I.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch1-10" href="part0055.html#ch1-link-10" class="calibre5">10</a></span> Thus, they are a better map of Western interest than of local custom and organization. Models, then, are most useful when we consider them in the context they were created. What was the cartographer trying to achieve? How does this influence what is depicted in the map?</p>

    <p class="center_quote">« As a branch of human endeavor, cartography has a long and interesting history that well reflects the state of cultural activity, as well as the perception of the world, in different periods. … Though technical in nature, cartography, like architecture, has attributes of both a scientific and artistic pursuit, a dichotomy not satisfactorily reconciled in all presentations. » <br class="calibre1"/><span class="attribution">Norman J.W. Thrower<span class="footnote_ref"><a id="ch1-11" href="part0055.html#ch1-link-11" class="calibre5">11</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="sp"><span class="akkurat_regular">Maps can influence territories:</span> This problem was part of the central argument put forth by Jane Jacobs in her groundbreaking work, <em class="italic">The Death and Life of Great American Cities.</em> She chronicled the efforts of city planners who came up with elaborate models for the design and organization of cities without paying any attention to how cities actually work. They then tried to fit the cities into the model. She describes how cities were changed to correspond to these models, and the often negative consequences of these efforts. “It became possible also to map out master plans for the statistical city, and people take these more seriously, for we are all accustomed to believe that maps and reality are necessarily related, or that if they are not, we can make them so by altering reality.” <span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch1-12" href="part0055.html#ch1-link-12" class="calibre5">12</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">Jacobs’ book is, in part, a cautionary tale of what can happen when faith in the model influences the decisions we make in the territory. When we try to fit complexity into the simplification.</p>

    <p class="center_quote">«In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the reality. » <br class="calibre1"/><span class="attribution">David Hand<span class="footnote_ref"><a id="ch1-13" href="part0055.html#ch1-link-13" class="calibre5">13</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">Conclusion</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Maps have long been a part of human society. They are valuable tools to pass on knowledge. Still, in using maps, abstractions, and models, we must always be wise to their limitations. They are, by definition, reductions of something far more complex. There is always at least an element of subjectivity, and we need to remember that they are created at particular moments in time.</p>

    <p class="body">This does not mean that we cannot use maps and models. We must use some model of the world in order to simplify it and therefore interact with it. We cannot explore every bit of territory for ourselves. We can use maps to guide us, but we must not let them prevent us from discovering new territory or updating our existing maps.</p>

    <p class="body">While navigating the world based on terrain is a useful goal, it’s not always possible. Maps, and models, help us understand and relate to the world around us. They are flawed but useful. In order to think a few steps ahead we must think beyond the map.</p>
