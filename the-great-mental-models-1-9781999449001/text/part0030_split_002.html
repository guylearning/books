      <p class="calibre2"><span>L</span>et’s try a real world example. Suppose you were to buy $100,000 of stock in Google, with 50% paid for in cash and 50% borrowed from the brokerage firm. (They call it a margin loan.)</p>

      <p class="archer">A few years later, the stock price has doubled: That means your $100,000 is worth $200,000. Since you still owe the brokerage $50,000, your own $50,000 is now worth $150,000—you’ve tripled your money! You consider yourself a financial genius.</p>

      <p class="archer">Before we land on that conclusion, though, let’s run our Theoretical World Generator a bunch of times in our head. What else could have happened, but didn’t?</p>

      <p class="archer">Google could have gone down 50% before it went up 100%—nearly all stocks on the exchange have had this happen to them at some time or another. In fact, Google could have gone down 90%! The whole New York Stock Exchange did just that between 1929 and 1932.</p>

      <p class="archer">What if something like that had happened? The brokerage would have called in your margin loan: Game over, thanks for playing. You would have been worth zero.</p>

      <p class="archer">Now, return to the beginning of the chapter again. If you’re going to buy Google on margin, is your bet that Google won’t go down 50% more similar to the LeBron/Allen thought experiment, or the LeBron/Durant thought experiment? Running through the scenario 100,000 times, how many times do you go broke and how many times do you triple your dough?</p>

      <p class="archer">This gives you some real decision-making power: It tells you about the limits of what you know and the limits of what you should attempt. It tells you, in an imprecise but useful way, a lot about how smart or stupid your decisions were regardless of the actual outcome. It makes you aware of your process, so that even if the results are good, you can recognize when this was all down to luck and that maybe you should work on your decision-making process to reduce the role of chance.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="body">An example of this is the famous “veil of ignorance” proposed by philosopher John Rawls in his influential <em class="italic">T</em><em class="italic">heory of Justice</em>. In order to figure out the most fair and equitable way to structure society, he proposed that the designers of said society operate behind a veil of ignorance. This means that they could not know who they would be in the society they were creating. If they designed the society without knowing their economic status, their ethnic background, talents and interests, or even their gender, they would have to put in place a structure that was as fair as possible in order to guarantee the best possible outcome for themselves.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch4-5" href="part0055.html#ch4-link-5" class="calibre5">5</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">Our initial intuition of what is fair is likely to be challenged during the “veil of ignorance” thought experiment. When confronted with the question of how best to organize society, we have this general feeling that it should be fair. But what exactly does this mean? We can use this thought experiment to test the likely outcomes of different rules and structures to come up with an aggregate of “most fair.”</p>

    <p class="body">We need not be constructing the legislation of entire nations for this type of thinking to be useful. Think, for example, of a company’s human resources policies on hiring, office etiquette, or parental leave. What kind of policies would you design or support if you didn’t know what your role in the company was? Or even anything about who you were?</p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">Conclusion</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Thought experiments tell you about the limits of what you know and the limits of what you should attempt. In order to improve our decision-making and increase our chances of success, we must be willing to probe all of the possibilities we can think of. Thought experiments are not daydreams. They require both rigor and work. But the more you use them, the more you understand actual cause and effect, and the more knowledge you have of what can really be accomplished.</p>
