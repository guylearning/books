    <h1 class="headings" id="calibre_pb_0">Thought Experiment</h1>

    <p class="calibre2">Thought experiments can be defined as “devices of the imagination used to investigate the nature of things.”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch4-1" href="part0055.html#ch4-link-1" class="calibre5">1</a></span> Many disciplines, such as philosophy and physics, make use of thought experiments to examine what can be known. In doing so, they can open up new avenues for inquiry and exploration. Thought experiments are powerful because they help us learn from our mistakes and avoid future ones. They let us take on the impossible, evaluate the potential consequences of our actions, and re-examine history to make better decisions. They can help us both figure out what we really want, and the best way to get there.</p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">Betting on basketball</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Suppose I asked you to tell me who would win in a game of basketball: The NBA champion LeBron James or the filmmaker Woody Allen? How much would you bet that your answer was correct?</p>

    <p class="body">I think you’d get me an answer pretty quickly, and I hope you’d bet all you had.</p>

    <p class="body">Next, suppose I asked you to tell me who’d win in a game of basketball: The NBA champion LeBron James or the NBA champion Kevin Durant? How much would you bet that your answer was correct?</p>

    <p class="body">A little harder, right? Would you bet anywhere near all you had on being right?</p>

    <p class="body">Let’s think this through. You attempted to solve both of the questions in the same way—you imagined the contests. Perhaps more importantly, you <em class="italic">didn’t</em><em class="italic"> </em>attempt to solve either of them by calling up Messrs. James, Allen, and Durant and inviting them over for an afternoon of basketball. You simply simulated them in your mind.</p>

    <p class="body">In the first case, your knowledge of James (young, tall, athletic, and skilled), Allen (old, small, frail, and funny), and the game of basketball gave you a clear mental image. The disparity between the players’ abilities makes the question (and the bet) a total no-brainer.</p>

    <p class="body">In the second case, your knowledge of LeBron and Durant may well be extensive, but that doesn’t make it an easy bet. They’re both professional basketball players who are quite similar in size and ability, and both of them are likely to go down as among the best ever to play the game. It’s doubtful that one is <em class="italic">much</em> better than the other in a one-on-one match. The only way to answer for sure would be to see them play. And even then, a one-off contest is not going to be definitive.</p>

    <p class="sp">A better way to answer the “who would win” question is through a remarkable ability of the human brain—the ability to conduct a detailed thought experiment. Its chief value is that it lets us do things in our heads we cannot do in real life, and so explore situations from more angles than we can physically examine and test for.</p>

    <p class="body">Thought experiments are more than daydreaming. They require the same rigor as a traditional experiment in order to be useful. Much like the scientific method, a thought experiment generally has the following steps:</p>

    <ol class="akkurat_regular3">
      <li class="sp1" value="1"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Ask a question</span></p></li>

      <li value="2" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Conduct background research</span></p></li>

      <li value="3" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Construct hypothesis</span></p></li>

      <li value="4" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Test with (thought) experiments</span></p></li>

      <li value="5" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Analyze outcomes and draw conclusions</span></p></li>

      <li value="6" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Compare to hypothesis and adjust accordingly (new question, etc.)</span></p></li>
    </ol>

    <p class="sp">In the James/Allen experiment above, we started with a question: Who would win in a game of basketball? If you didn’t already know who those people were, finding out would have been a necessary piece of background research. Then you came out with your hypothesis (James all the way!), and you thought it through.</p>

      <p class="captions"><span>_</span><br class="calibre1"/>Who would win in a game of one-on-one?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="body">One of the real powers of the thought experiment is that there is no limit to the number of times you can change a variable to see if it influences the outcome. In order to place that bet, you would want to estimate in how many possible basketball games does Woody Allen beat LeBron James. Out of 100,000 game scenarios, Allen probably only wins in the few where LeBron starts the game by having a deadly heart attack. Experimenting to discover the full spectrum of possible outcomes gives you a better appreciation for what you can influence and what you can reasonably expect to happen.</p>

    <p class="sp">Let’s now explore few areas in which thought experiments are tremendously useful.</p>

    <ol class="akkurat_regular3">
      <li value="1" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Imagining physical impossibilities</span></p></li>

      <li value="2" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Re-imagining history</span></p></li>

      <li value="3" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular">Intuiting the non-intuitive</span></p></li>
    </ol>

    <p class="sp"><span class="akkurat_regular">Imagining physical impossibilities:</span> Albert Einstein was a great user of the thought experiment because it is a way to logically carry out a test in one’s own head that would be very difficult or impossible to perform in real life. With this tool, we can solve problems with intuition and logic that cannot be demonstrated physically.</p>

    <p class="body">One of his notable thought experiments involved an elevator.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch4-2" href="part0055.html#ch4-link-2" class="calibre5">2</a></span> Imagine you were in a closed elevator, feet glued to the floor. Absent any other information, would you be able to know whether the elevator was in outer space with a string pulling the elevator upwards at an accelerating rate, or sitting on Earth, being pulled down by gravity? By running the thought experiment, Einstein concluded that you would not.</p>

    <p class="body">This led to the formulation of Einstein’s second major theory, the general theory of relativity—his universal theory of gravity. Einstein’s hypothesis was that the force you felt from acceleration and the force you felt from gravity didn’t just <em class="italic">feel</em><em class="italic"> </em>the same—they were the same! Gravity must work similarly to the accelerating elevator. We can’t build elevators in space, but can still define some of the properties they would have if we could. This gives us enough information to test the hypothesis. Eventually, Einstein worked it all out mathematically and in great detail, but it started with a simple thought experiment, impossible to actually perform.</p>

    <p class="body">This type of thought experiment need not only apply to physics and is actually reflected in some of our common expressions. When we say “if money were no object” or “if you had all the time in the world,” we are asking someone to conduct a thought experiment because actually removing that variable (money or time) is physically impossible. In reality, money is always an object, and we never have all the time in the world. But the act of detailing out the choices we would make in these alternate realities that have otherwise similar properties to our current one, doing the thought experiment, is what leads to insights regarding what we value in life and where to focus our energies. <span class="sidebar_marker1">— Sidebar: The Trolley Experiment</span></p>

    <p class="sp"><span class="akkurat_regular">Re-imagining history:</span> A familiar use of the thought experiment is to re-imagine history. This one we all use, all the time. What if I hadn’t been stuck at the airport bar where I met my future business partner? Would World War I have started if Gavrilo Princip hadn’t shot the Archduke of Austria in Sarajevo? If Cleopatra hadn’t found a way to meet Caesar, would she still have been able to take the throne of Egypt?</p>

    <p class="body">These approaches are called the <em class="italic">historical counter-factual and semi-factual. </em>If Y happened instead of X, what would the outcome have been? Would the outcome have been the same?</p>

    <p class="body">As popular—and generally useful—as counter- and semi-factuals are, they are also the areas of thought experiment with which we need to use the most caution. Why? Because history is what we call a chaotic system. A small change in the beginning conditions can cause a <em class="italic">very</em><em class="italic"> </em>different outcome down the line. This is where the rigor of the scientific method is indispensable if we want to draw conclusions that are actually useful.</p>
