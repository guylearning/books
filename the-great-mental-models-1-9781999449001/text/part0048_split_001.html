      <p class="calibre2"><span>O</span>ccam’s Razor can be quite powerful in the medical field, for both doctors and patients. Let’s suppose that a patient shows up at a doctor’s office with horrible flu-like symptoms. Are they more likely to have the flu or have contracted Ebola?</p>

      <p class="archer">This is a problem best solved by a concept we explored in the chapter on Probabilistic Thinking, called Bayesian Updating. It’s a way of using general background knowledge in solving specific problems with new information. We know that generally the flu is far more common than Ebola, so when a good doctor encounters a patient with what looks like the flu, the simplest explanation is almost certainly the correct one. A diagnosis of Ebola means a call to the Center for Disease Control and a quarantine—an expensive and panic-inducing mistake if the patient just has the flu. Thus, medical students are taught to heed the saying, “When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras.”</p>

      <p class="archer">And for patients, Occam’s Razor is a good counter to hypochondria. Based on the same principles, you factor in the current state of your health to an evaluation of your current symptoms. Knowing that the simplest explanation is most likely to be true can help us avoid unnecessary panic and stress.</p>

    <p class="body">In another life-and-death situation, in 1989 Bengal tigers killed about 60 villagers from India’s Ganges delta.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch8-13" href="part0055.html#ch8-link-13" class="calibre5">13</a></span> No weapons seemed to work against them, including lacing dummies with live wires to shock the tigers away from human populations.</p>

    <p class="body">Then a student at the Science Club of Calcutta noticed that tigers only attacked when they thought they were unseen, and recalled that the patterns decorating some species of butterflies, beetles, and caterpillars look like big eyes, ostensibly to trick predators into thinking their prey was also watching them. The result: a human face mask, worn on the back of head. Remarkably, no one wearing a mask was attacked by a tiger for the next three years; anyone killed by tigers during that time had either refused to wear the mask, or had taken it off while working. <span class="sidebar_marker1">— Sidebar: Occam’s Razor in the Medical Field</span></p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">A few caveats</p>

    <p class="calibre2">One important counter to Occam’s Razor is the difficult truth that some things are simply not<em class="italic"> </em>that simple. The regular recurrence of fraudulent human organizations like pyramid schemes and Ponzi schemes is not a miracle, but neither is it obvious. No simple explanation suffices, exactly. They are a result of a complex set of behaviors, some happening almost by accident or luck, and some carefully designed with the intent to deceive. It isn’t a bit easy to spot the development of a fraud. If it was, they’d be stamped out early. Yet, to this day, frauds frequently grow to epic proportions before they are discovered.</p>

    <p class="body">Alternatively, consider the achievement of human flight. It, too, might seem like a miracle to our 17th century friar, but it isn’t—it’s a natural consequence of applied physics. Still, it took a long time for humans to figure out because it’s not simple at all. In fact, the invention of powered human flight is highly counterintuitive, requiring an understanding of airflow, lift, drag, and combustion, among other difficult concepts. Only a precise combination of the right factors will do. You can’t just know enough to get the aircraft off the ground, you need to keep it in the air!</p>
