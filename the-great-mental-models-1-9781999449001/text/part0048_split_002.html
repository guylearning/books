      <p class="calibre2"><span>W</span>hen Louis Gerstner took over IBM in the early 1990s, during one of the worst periods of struggle in its history, many business pundits called for a statement of his vision. What rabbit would Gerstner pull out of his hat to save Big Blue?</p>

      <p class="archer">It seemed a logical enough demand—wouldn’t a technology company that had fallen behind need a grand vision of brilliant technological leadership to regain its place among the leaders of American innovation? As Gerstner put it, “The IBM organization, so full of brilliant, insightful people, would have loved to receive a bold recipe for success—the more sophisticated, the more complicated the recipe, the better everyone would have liked it.”</p>

      <p class="archer">Smartly, Gerstner realized that the simple approach was most likely to be the effective one. His famous reply was that “the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision.” What IBM actually needed to do was to serve its customers, compete for business in the here and now, and focus on businesses that were already profitable. It needed simple, tough-minded business execution.</p>

      <p class="archer">By the end of the 1990s, Gerstner had provided exactly that, bringing IBM back from the brink without any brilliant visions or massive technological overhauls.</p>

    <p class="body">Simple as we wish things were, irreducible complexity, like simplicity, is a part of our reality. Therefore, we can’t use this Razor to create artificial simplicity. If something cannot be broken down any further, we must deal with it as it is.</p>

    <p class="body">How do you know something is as simple as it can be? Think of computer code. Code can sometimes be excessively complex. In trying to simplify it, we would still have to make sure it can perform the functions we need it to. This is one way to understand simplicity. An explanation can be simplified only to the extent that it can still provide an accurate understanding.</p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">Conclusion</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Of course, focusing on simplicity when all others are focused on complexity is a hallmark of genius, and it’s easier said than done. But always remembering that a simpler explanation is more likely to be correct than a complicated one goes a long way towards helping us conserve our most precious resources of time and energy. <span class="sidebar_marker1">— Sidebar: The Razor in Leadership</span></p>
