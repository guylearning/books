      <p class="calibre2"><span>“E</span>very statistician knows that a large, relevant sample size is their best friend. What are the three largest, most relevant sample sizes for identifying universal principles? Bucket number one is inorganic systems, which are 13.7 billion years in size. It’s all the laws of math and physics, the entire physical universe. Bucket number two is organic systems, 3.5 billion years of biology on Earth. And bucket number three is human history, you can pick your own number, I picked 20,000 years of recorded human behavior. Those are the three largest sample sizes we can access and the most relevant.” —Peter Kaufman</p>

      <p class="sp">The larger and more relevant the sample size, the more reliable the model based on it is. But the key to sample sizes is to look for them not just over space, but over time. You need to reach back into the past as far as you can to contribute to your sample. We have a tendency to think that how the world is, is how it always was. And so we get caught up validating our assumptions from what we find in the here and now. But the continents used to be pushed against each other, dinosaurs walked the planet for millions of years, and we are not the only hominid to evolve. Looking to the past can provide essential context for understanding where we are now.</p>

    <p class="body">Removing blind spots means thinking through the problem using different lenses or models. When we do this the blind spots slowly go away and we gain an understanding of the problem.</p>

    <p class="body">We’re much like the blind men in the classic parable of the elephant, going through life trying to explain everything through one limited lens. Too often that lens is driven by our particular field, be it economics, engineering, physics, mathematics, biology, chemistry, or something else entirely. Each of these disciplines holds some truth and yet none of them contain the whole truth.</p>

    <p class="body">Here’s another way to look at it: think of a forest. When a botanist looks at it they may focus on the ecosystem, an environmentalist sees the impact of climate change, a forestry engineer the state of the tree growth, a business person the value of the land. None are wrong, but neither are any of them able to describe the full scope of the forest. Sharing knowledge, or learning the basics of the other disciplines, would lead to a more well-rounded understanding that would allow for better initial decisions about managing the forest.</p>

    <p class="body">Relying on only a few models is like having a 400-horsepower brain that’s only generating 50 horsepower of output. To increase your mental efficiency and reach your 400-horsepower potential, you need to use a latticework of mental models. Exactly the same sort of pattern that graces backyards everywhere, a lattice is a series of points that connect to and reinforce each other. The Great Models can be understood in the same way—models influence and interact with each other to create a structure that can be used to evaluate and understand ideas.</p>

      <p class="captions"><span>_</span><br class="calibre1"/>A group of blind people approach a strange animal, called an elephant. None of them are aware of its shape and form. So they decide to understand it by touch. The first person, whose hand touches the trunk, says, “This creature is like a thick snake.” For the second person, whose hand finds an ear, it seems like a type of fan. The third person, whose hand is on a leg, says the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The fourth blind man who places his hand on the side says, “An elephant is a wall.” The fifth, who feels its tail, describes it as a rope. The last touches its tusk, and states the elephant is something that is hard and smooth, like a spear.</p>

    <p class="body">In a famous speech in the 1990s, Charlie Munger summed up this approach to practical wisdom: “Well, the first rule is that you can’t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ‘em back. If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form. You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience both vicarious and direct on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="introduction-8" href="part0055.html#introduction-link-8" class="calibre5">8</a></span></p>

    <p class="center_quote">« The chief enemy of good decisions is a lack of sufficient perspectives on a problem. » <br class="calibre1"/><span class="attribution">Alain de Botton<span class="footnote_ref"><a id="introduction-9" href="part0055.html#introduction-link-9" class="calibre5">9</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">Expanding your latticework of mental models</p>

    <p class="calibre2">A latticework is an excellent way to conceptualize mental models, because it demonstrates the reality and value of interconnecting knowledge. The world does not isolate itself into discrete disciplines. We only break it down that way because it makes it easier to study it. But once we learn something, we need to put it back into the complex system in which it occurs. We need to see where it connects to other bits of knowledge, to build our understanding of the whole. This is the value of putting the knowledge contained in mental models into a latticework.</p>

    <p class="body">It reduces the blind spots that limit our view of not only the immediate problem, but the second and subsequent order effects of our potential solutions. Without a latticework of the Great Models our decisions become harder, slower, and less creative. But by using a mental models approach, we can complement our specializations by being curious about how the rest of the world works. A quick glance at the Nobel Prize winners list show that many of them, obviously extreme specialists in something, had multidisciplinary interests that supported their achievements.</p>

    <p class="body">To help you build your latticework of mental models, this book, and the books that follow, attempt to arm you with the big models from multiple disciplines. We’ll take a look at biology, physics, chemistry, economics, and even psychology. We don’t need to master all the details from these disciplines, just the fundamentals.</p>

    <p class="body">To quote Charlie Munger, “80 or 90 important models will carry about 90 percent of the freight in making you a worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight.”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="introduction-10" href="part0055.html#introduction-link-10" class="calibre5">10</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">These books attempt to collect and make accessible organized common sense—the 80 to 90 mental models you need to get started. To help you understand the models, we will relate them to historical examples and stories. Our website <span class="akkurat_regular"><a href="https://fs.blog/" class="calibre3">fs.blog</a></span> will have even more practical examples.</p>

    <p class="body">The more high-quality mental models you have in your mental toolbox, the more likely you will have the ones needed to understand the problem. And understanding is everything. The better you understand, the better the potential actions you can take. The better the potential actions, the fewer problems you’ll encounter down the road. Better models make better decisions.</p>

    <p class="center_quote">«I think it is undeniably true that the human brain must work in models. The trick is to have your brain work better than the other person’s brain because it understands the most fundamental models: ones that will do most work per unit. If you get into the mental habit of relating what you’re reading to the basic structure of the underlying ideas being demonstrated, you gradually accumulate some wisdom.»<br class="calibre1"/><span class="attribution">Charlie Munger<span class="footnote_ref"><a id="introduction-11" href="part0055.html#introduction-link-11" class="calibre5">11</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">It takes time, but the benefits are enormous</p>

    <p class="calibre2">What successful people do is file away a massive, but finite, amount of fundamental, established, essentially unchanging knowledge that can be used in evaluating the infinite number of unique scenarios which show up in the real world.</p>

    <p class="body">It’s not just knowing the mental models that is important. First you must learn them, but then you must use them. Each decision presents an opportunity to comb through your repertoire and try one out, so you can also learn how to use them. This will slow you down at first, and you won’t always choose the right models, but you will get better and more efficient at using mental models as time progresses.</p>

    <p class="body">We need to work hard at synthesizing across the borders of our knowledge, and most importantly, synthesizing all of the ideas we learn with <em class="italic">reality itself</em>. No model contains the entire truth, whatever that may be. What good are math and biology and psychology unless we know how they fit together in reality itself, and how to use them to make our lives better? It would be like dying of hunger because we don’t know how to combine and cook any of the foods in our pantry.</p>

    <p class="center_quote">«Disciplines, like nations, are a necessary evil that enable human beings of bounded rationality to simplify their goals and reduce their choices to calculable limits. But parochialism is everywhere, and the world badly needs international and interdisciplinary travelers to carry new knowledge from one enclave to another.» <br class="calibre1"/><span class="attribution">Herbert Simon<span class="footnote_ref"><a id="introduction-12" href="part0055.html#introduction-link-12" class="calibre5">12</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="calibre2">You won’t always get it right. Sometimes the model, or models, you choose to use won’t be the best ones for that situation. That’s okay. The more you use them, the more you will be able to build the knowledge of indicators that can trigger the use of the most appropriate model. Using and failing, as long as you acknowledge, reflect, and learn from it, is also how you build your repertoire.</p>

    <p class="body">You need to be deliberate about choosing the models you will use in a situation. As you use them, a great practice is to record and reflect. That way you can get better at both choosing models and applying them. Take the time to notice how you applied them, what the process was like, and what the results were. Over time you will develop your knowledge of which situations are best tackled through which models. Don’t give up on a model if it doesn’t help you right away. Learn more about it, and try to figure out exactly why it didn’t work. It may be that you have to improve your understanding. Or there were aspects of the situation that you did not consider. Or that your focus was on the wrong variable. So keep a journal. Write your experiences down. When you identify a model at work in the world, write that down too. Then you can explore the applications you’ve observed, and start being more in control of the models you use every day. For instance, instead of falling victim to confirmation bias, you will be able to step back and see it at work in yourself and others. Once you get practice, you will start to naturally apply models as you go through your life, from reading the news to contemplating a career move.</p>

    <p class="body">As we have seen, we can run into problems when we apply models to situations in which they don’t fit. If a model works, we must invest the time and energy into understanding why it worked so we know when to use it again. At the beginning the process is more important than the outcome. As you use the models, stay open to the feedback loops. Reflect and learn. You will get better. It will become easier. Results will become more profoundly useful, more broadly applicable, and more memorable. While this book isn’t intended to be a book specifically about making better decisions, it will help you make better decisions. Mental models are not an excuse to create a lengthy decision process but rather to help you move away from seeing things the way you think they should be to the way they are. Uncovering this knowledge will naturally help your decision-making. Right now you are only touching one part of the elephant, so you are making all decisions based on your understanding that it’s a wall or a rope, not an animal. As soon as you begin to take in the knowledge that other people have of the world, like learning the perspectives others have of the elephant, you will start having more success because your decisions will be aligned with how the world really is.</p>

    <p class="body">When you start to understand the world better, when the whys seem less mysterious, you gain confidence in how you navigate it. The successes will accrue. And more success means more time, less stress, and ultimately a more meaningful life.</p>
