      <p class="calibre2"><span>T</span>rust and trustworthiness are the results of multiple interactions. This is why second-order thinking is so useful and valuable. Going for the immediate payoff in our interactions with people, unless they are a win-win, almost always guarantees that interaction will be a one-off. Maximizing benefits is something that happens over time. Thus, considering the effects of the effects of our actions on others, or on our reputations, is critical to getting people to trust us, and to enjoy the benefits of cooperation that come with that.</p>

    <p class="body">In reality we will never know for sure. We can only make an educated guess. But given that Cleopatra ruled Egypt quite successfully for many years after these events, her decision was based on seeing the effects of the effects. If she could somehow make it through the short-term pain, then her leadership had much greater chances of being successful with the support of Caesar and Rome than without it. As Schiff notes, “The Alexandrian War gave Cleopatra everything she wanted. It cost her little.” In winning the civil war Caesar got rid of all major opposition to Cleopatra and firmly aligned himself with her reign.</p>

    <p class="body">Being aware of second-order consequences and using them to guide your decision-making may mean the short term is less spectacular, but the payoffs for the long term can be enormous. By delaying gratification now, you will save time in the future. You won’t have to clean up the mess you made on account of not thinking through the effects of your short-term desires. <span class="sidebar_marker1">— Sidebar: Developing Trust for Future Success</span></p>

    <p class="sp"><span class="akkurat_regular">Constructing an effective argument:</span> Second-order thinking can help you avert problems and anticipate challenges that you can then address in advance.</p>

    <p class="body">For example, most of us have to construct arguments every day. Convincing your boss to take a chance on a new form of outreach, convincing your spouse to try a new parenting technique. Life is filled with the need to be persuasive. Arguments are more effective when we demonstrate that we have considered the second-order effects and put effort into verifying that these are desirable as well.</p>

    <p class="body">In late 18th-century England, women had very few rights. Philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was frustrated that this lack of rights limited a woman’s ability to be independent and make choices on how to live her life. Instead of arguing, however, for why women should get rights, she recognized that she had to demonstrate the value that these rights would confer. She explained the benefits to society that would be realized as a result of those rights. She argued for the education of women because this would in turn make them better wives and mothers, more able to both support themselves and raise smart, conscientious children.</p>

    <p class="body">Her thoughts, from <em class="italic">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, are a demonstration of second-order thinking:</p>

    <p class="body1"><em class="italic">Asserting the rights which women in common with men ought to contend for, I have not attempted to extenuate their faults; but to prove them to be the natural consequence of their education and station in society. If so, it is reasonable to suppose that they will change their character, and correct their vices and follies, when they are allowed to be free in a physical, moral, and civil sense.</em><span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch5-6" href="part0055.html#ch5-link-6" class="calibre5">6</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">Empowering women was a first-order effect of recognizing that women had rights. But by discussing the logical consequences this would have on society, the second-order effects, she started a conversation that eventually resulted in what we now call feminism. Not only would women get freedoms they deserved, they would become better women, and better members of society.</p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">A word of caution</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Second-order thinking, as valuable as it is, must be tempered in one important way: You can’t let it lead to the paralysis of the Slippery Slope Effect, the idea that if we start with action A, everything after is a slippery slope down to hell, with a chain of consequences B, C, D, E, and F.</p>

    <p class="body">Garrett Hardin smartly addresses this in <em class="italic">Filters Against Folly</em>:</p>

    <p class="body1"><em class="italic">Those who take the wedge (Slippery Slope) argument with the utmost seriousness act as though they think human beings are completely devoid of practical judgment. Countless examples from everyday life show the pessimists are wrong…If we took the wedge argument seriously, we would pass a law forbidding all vehicles to travel at any speed greater than zero. That would be an easy way out of the moral problem. But we pass no such law.</em><span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch5-7" href="part0055.html#ch5-link-7" class="calibre5">7</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">In practical life, everything has limits. Even if we consider second and subsequent effects, we can only go so far. During waves of Prohibition fever in the United States and elsewhere, conservative abstainers have frequently made the case that even taking the<em class="italic"> first</em><em class="italic"> </em>drink would be the first step towards a life of sin. They’re right: It’s true that drinking a beer<em class="italic"> might</em> lead you to become an alcoholic. But not most of the time.</p>

    <p class="body">Thus we need to avoid the slippery slope and the analysis paralysis it can lead to. Second-order thinking needs to evaluate the most likely effects and their most likely consequences, checking our understanding of what the typical results of our actions will be. If we worried about all possible effects of effects of our actions, we would likely never do anything, and we’d be wrong. How you’ll balance the need for higher-order thinking with practical, limiting judgment must be taken on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">Conclusion</p>

    <p class="calibre2">We don’t make decisions in a vacuum and we can’t get something for nothing. When making choices, considering consequences can help us avoid future problems. We must ask ourselves the critical question: And then what?</p>

    <p class="body">Consequences come in many varieties, some more tangible than others. Thinking in terms of the system in which you are operating will allow you to see that your consequences have consequences. Thinking through a problem as far as you can with the information you have allows us to consider time, scale, thresholds, and more. And weighing different paths is what thinking is all about. A little time spent thinking ahead can save us massive amounts of time later.</p>
