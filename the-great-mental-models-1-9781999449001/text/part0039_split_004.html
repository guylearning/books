      <p class="calibre2"><span>T</span>he most probability-acute businesses in the world are insurance companies—because they must be. When we think of insurance, we might think of life insurance (the probability of a policyholder dying at a certain age), or auto insurance (the probability of being in a car accident), or maybe home insurance (the probability of a tree falling on the house). With the statistics available to us, the probabilities of these things are easy to price and predict across a large enough population.</p>

      <p class="archer">But insurance is deeply wide-ranging, and insurers will insure almost any event, for a price. Insurance policies have been taken out on Victoria’s Secret models’ legs, on baseball players’ arms, on the Pepsi Challenge and the NCAA tournament, and even on a famous country singer’s breasts!</p>

      <p class="archer">How is this possible? Only with a close attention to probability. What the great insurance companies in the world know how to do is pay attention to the important factors, even if they’re not totally predictable, and price accordingly.</p>

      <p class="archer">What is the probability of a Victoria’s Secret model injuring her legs badly enough to end her career? One in 10,000? One in 100,000? Getting it right would mean evaluating her lifestyle, her habits, her health, her family history—and coming up with a price and a set of conditions that are good enough to provide a profit on average. It’s not unlike handicapping a race at the horse tracks. You can always say yes to insuring, but the trick is to come up with the right price. And for that we need probability.</p>
