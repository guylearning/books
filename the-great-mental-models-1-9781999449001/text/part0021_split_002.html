      <p class="calibre2"><span>T</span>he idea a circle of competence in the realm of investments was stated very well by Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett. When asked, he recommended that each individual stick to their area of special competence, and be very reluctant to stray. For when we stray too far, we get into areas where we don’t even know what we don’t know. We may not even know the questions we need to ask.</p>

      <p class="archer">To explain his point, Buffett gives the example of a Russian immigrant woman who ran one of his businesses, the famous Nebraska Furniture Mart. The CEO, Rose Blumkin, spoke little English and could barely read or write, yet had a head for two things: numbers, and home furnishings. She stuck to those areas and built one of the country’s great retailing establishments. Here it is in Buffett’s words:</p>

      <p class="archer3"><em class="italic">I couldn’t have given her $200 million worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock when I bought the business because she doesn’t understand stock. She understands cash. She understands furniture. She understands real estate. She doesn’t understand stocks, so she doesn’t have anything to do with them. If you deal with Mrs. B in what I would call her circle of competence…. She is going to buy 5,000 end tables this afternoon (if the price is right). She is going to buy 20 different carpets in odd lots, and everything else like that [snaps fingers] because she understands carpets. She wouldn’t buy 100 shares of General Motors if it was at 50 cents a share.</em><span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch2-12" href="part0055.html#ch2-link-12" class="calibre5">12</a></span></p>

      <p class="archer">Her iron focus on the things she knew best was largely responsible for her massive success in spite of the obstacles she faced.</p>
