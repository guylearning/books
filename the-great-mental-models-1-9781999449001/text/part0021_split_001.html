      <h2 class="serif_title" id="calibre_pb_3">The Problem of Incentives</h2>

      <p class="calibre2"><span>T</span>he problem of incentives can really skew how much you can rely on someone else’s circle of competence. This is particularly acute in the financial realm. Until recently, nearly all financial products we might be pushed into had commissions attached to them—in other words, our advisor made more money by giving us one set of advice than another, regardless of its wisdom. Fortunately, the rise of things like index funds of the stock and bond markets has mostly alleviated the issue.</p>

      <p class="archer">In cases like financial advisory, we’re not on solid ground until we know, in some detail, the compensation arrangement our advisor is under.</p>

      <p class="archer">The same goes for buying furniture, buying a house, or buying a washing machine at a retail store. What does the knowledgeable advisor stand to gain from our purchase?</p>

      <p class="archer">It goes beyond sales, of course. Whenever we are getting advice, it is from a person whose set of incentives is not the same as ours. It is not being cynical to know that this is the case, and to then act accordingly.</p>

      <p class="sp">Suppose we want to take our car to a mechanic. Most of us, especially in this day and age, are complete Strangers in that land; we subsequently are open to be taken advantage of. There is not only an asymmetry in our general knowledge base about mechanics of a car, there is usually an asymmetry of knowledge about the actual current problem with the car. We haven’t been under the hood, but the mechanic has. We know his incentive in this situation; it’s to get us to spend as much as possible while still retaining us as a customer. The only solution, at least until we reach a certain level of trust with our mechanic, is to suck it up and learn a bit of the trade.</p>

      <p class="archer">Fortunately, these days that is easy with the aid of the internet. And we don’t need to learn it ahead of time. We can learn it on an as-needed basis. The way to do it, in this case, would be to defer all decisions on major spending until you’ve had time to poke around the resources you can find online and at least confirm that the mechanic isn’t making a major bluff.</p>

    <p class="body">When Queen Elizabeth I of England ascended to the throne, her reign was by no means assured. The tumultuous years under her father, brother, and sister had contributed to a political situation that was precarious at best. England was in a religious crisis that was threatening the stability of the kingdom, and was essentially broke.</p>

    <p class="body">Elizabeth knew there were aspects of leading the country that were outside her circle of competence. She had an excellent education and had spent most of her life just trying to survive. Perhaps that is why she was able to identify and admit to what she didn’t know.</p>

    <p class="body">In her first speech as Queen, Elizabeth announced, “I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch2-9" href="part0055.html#ch2-link-9" class="calibre5">9</a></span> After outlining her intent upon becoming Queen, she proceeded to build her Privy Council—effectively the royal advisory board. She didn’t copy her immediate predecessors, filling her council with yes men or wealthy incompetents who happen to have the same religious values. She blended the old and the new to develop stability and achieve continuity. She kept the group small so that real discussions could happen. She wanted a variety of opinions that could be challenged and debated.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch2-10" href="part0055.html#ch2-link-10" class="calibre5">10</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">In large measure due to the advice she received from this council, advice that was the product of open debate that took in the circles of competence of each of the participants, Elizabeth took England from a country of civil unrest and frequent persecution to one that inspired loyalty and creativity in its citizens. She sowed the seeds for the empire that would eventually come to control one quarter of the globe.</p>

      <p class="captions"><span>_</span><br class="calibre1"/>Elizabeth I led her country at a time when very few women had public positions of power. It is testament to her strength and intelligence that she was able to admit what she didn’t know and take counsel from others.</p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular4">Conclusion</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Critically, we must keep in mind that our circles of competence extend only so far. There are boundaries on the areas in which we develop the ability to make accurate decisions. In any given situation, there are people who have a circle, who have put in the time and effort to really understand the information.</p>

    <p class="body">It is also important to remember that no one can have a circle of competence that encompasses everything. There is only so much you can know with great depth of understanding. This is why being able to identify your circle, and knowing how to move around outside of it, is so important.</p>
