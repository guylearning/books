    <h1 class="headings" id="calibre_pb_0">Inversion</h1>

    <p class="calibre2">Inversion is a powerful tool to improve your thinking because it helps you identify and remove obstacles to success. The root of inversion is “invert,” which means to upend or turn upside down. As a thinking tool it means approaching a situation from the opposite end of the natural starting point. Most of us tend to think one way about a problem: forward. Inversion allows us to flip the problem around and think backward. Sometimes it’s good to start at the beginning, but it can be more useful to start at the end.</p>

    <p class="body">Think of it this way: Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance. Combining the ability to think forward and backward allows you to see reality from multiple angles.</p>

    <p class="sp">There are two approaches to applying inversion in your life.</p>

    <ol class="calibre9">
      <li value="1" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">Start by assuming that what you’re trying to prove is either true or false, then show what else would have to be true.</p></li>

      <li value="2" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">Instead of aiming directly for your goal, think deeply about what you want to <em class="italic">avoid</em><em class="italic"> </em>and then see what options are left over.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p class="sp"><span class="akkurat_regular">Set your assumptions:</span> The 19th century German mathematician Carl Jacobi became famous for a number of reasons—including solving some ungodly difficult problems—but is perhaps best remembered for his advice to “invert, always invert.” Jacobi solved a range of problems by starting with the endpoint. When faced with proving an axiom in a difficult math problem, he might instead assume a property of the axiom was correct and then try to determine the consequences of this assumption. From that point, he could work out surprising, and at times counterintuitive, insights.</p>

    <p class="body">Jacobi was not the first mathematician to use inversion. In fact, inversion is a staple of mathematical, philosophical, and scientific inquiry. We can look around today and appreciate that we can’t see atoms and quarks, but we know they exist because we can make predictions about their behavior and test those predictions.</p>

    <p class="body">Or we can go back 2,300 years and look at the work of the Greek Hippasus, a follower of Pythagoras.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch7-2" href="part0055.html#ch7-link-2" class="calibre5">2</a></span> (Yes, the one with the Theorem.) His attempts to derive the square root of 2, and his original direct approach to solving the problem (essentially, dividing larger and larger whole numbers into each other) were both fruitless and time consuming. He hit an impasse, realizing that he’d never be able to definitely solve the problem by thinking forward. In his increasing frustration, Hippasus decided to take the reverse route, thinking about what the square root of 2 might <em class="italic">imply</em>, and working backwards from there. If he couldn’t find it the way he had expected to, he’d start by proving what the number <em class="italic">couldn’t</em><em class="italic"> </em>be. His quest forever changed what we understood about mathematics, and led to the discovery of the first irrational number.</p>

    <p class="body">Mathematics is not the only area where using inversion can produce surprising and non-intuitive results. In the 1920s the American Tobacco Company wanted to sell more of their Lucky Strike cigarettes to women. Men were smoking, but women weren’t. There were pervasive taboos against women smoking—it was seen as a man’s activity. Women therefore presented an untapped market that had the potential of providing huge revenue. The head of the company thought that they needed to convince women that smoking would make them thinner, riding on the slimness trend that had already begun, so he hired Edward Bernays, who came up with a truly revolutionary marketing campaign.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch7-3" href="part0055.html#ch7-link-3" class="calibre5">3</a></span><span class="footnote_ref2">,</span><span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch7-4" href="part0055.html#ch7-link-4" class="calibre5">4</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">In the style of the inversion approach described above, Bernays did not ask, “How do I sell more cigarettes to women?” Instead, he wondered, if women bought and smoked cigarettes, what else would have to be true? What would have to change in the world to make smoking desirable to women and socially acceptable? Then—a step farther—once he knew what needed to change, how would he achieve that?</p>
