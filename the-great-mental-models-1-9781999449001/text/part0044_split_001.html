      <p class="calibre2"><span>T</span>he first great detective to capture the public imagination was Sherlock Holmes. He solved cases in ways that were unfathomable to others, yet seemed obvious in retrospect. He gave the appearance of being a magician, but really he was an excellent observer. He was also a master of inversion.</p>

      <p class="archer">In his third case, “A Scandal in Bohemia,”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch7-5" href="part0055.html#ch7-link-5" class="calibre5">5</a></span> Holmes is hired by a king to recover a compromising photograph in which the king appears with an American opera singer, Irene Adler. The king is fearful that Adler will use the picture of the two of them to prevent his upcoming marriage or to blackmail him in the future. He does not want to live under this threat, and so hires Sherlock Holmes to retrieve the picture from Adler.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="archer">Presented with this task, what does Holmes do? What would you do? Does he study Adler for months to determine where, based on her personality, she is likely to hide the picture? Does he break into her house and perform a systematic exploration of every nook and cranny? No. Instead, he inverts the problem.</p>

      <p class="archer">If it is true that Adler has this compromising picture of the king and is planning to blackmail him, what would also be true? Likely that she would greatly value the photo as it will bring her money, and that it would be hidden in an accessible location so she could retrieve it in a hurry. We tend to keep our most prized possessions where we can easily grab them in case of emergency.</p>

      <p class="archer">So Holmes contrives a scenario in which he is able to be in her house while Watson creates an illusion of a fire on the street outside. Believing the threat, Adler takes the photo out of its hiding place before escaping. In one instant Holmes both confirms the existence of the photo and now knows its whereabouts. By starting with the logical outcome of his assumptions and seeking to validate those, he advances his case with significantly more efficiency and accuracy than if he had searched first for proof of the assumptions themselves.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="body">To tackle the idea of smoking as a slimming aid, he mounted a large anti-sweets campaign. After dinner, it was about cigarettes, not dessert. Cigarettes were slimming, while desserts would ruin one’s figure. But Bernays’s real stroke of genius lay not just in coming out with adverts to convince women to stay slim by smoking cigarettes; “instead, he sought nothing less than to reshape American society and culture.”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch7-6" href="part0055.html#ch7-link-6" class="calibre5">6</a></span> He solicited journalists and photographers to promote the virtues of being slim. He sought testimonials from doctors about the health value of smoking after a meal. He combined this approach with</p>

    <p class="body1"><em class="italic">…altering the very environment, striving to create a world in which the cigarette was ubiquitous. He mounted a campaign to persuade hotels and restaurants to add cigarettes to dessert-list menus, and he provided such magazines as </em>House and Garden<em class="italic"> with feature articles that included menus designed to preserve readers ‘from the dangers of overeating’…. The idea was not only to influence opinion but to remold life itself. Bernays approached designers, architects, and cabinetmakers in an effort to persuade them to design kitchen cabinets that included special compartments for cigarettes, and he spoke to the manufacturers of kitchen containers to add cigarette tins to their traditional lines of labeled containers for coffee, tea, sugar, and flour.</em><span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch7-7" href="part0055.html#ch7-link-7" class="calibre5">7</a></span></p>

    <p class="body">The result was a complete shift in the consumption habits of American women. It wasn’t just about selling the cigarette, it was reorganizing society to make cigarettes an inescapable part of the American woman’s daily experience.</p>

    <p class="body">Bernays’s efforts to make smoking in public socially acceptable had equally startling results. He linked cigarette smoking with women’s emancipation. To smoke was to be free. Cigarettes were marketed as “torches of freedom.” He orchestrated public events, including an infamous parade on Easter Sunday in 1929 which featured women smoking as they walked in the parade. He left no detail unattended, so public perception of smoking was changed almost overnight. He both normalized it and made it desirable in one swoop.</p>

    <p class="body">Although the campaign utilized more principles than just inversion, it was the original decision to invert the approach that provided the framework from which the campaign was created and executed. Bernays didn’t focus on how to sell more cigarettes to women within the existing social structure. Sales would have undoubtedly been a lot more limited. Instead he thought about what the world would look like if women smoked often and anywhere, and then set about trying to make that world a reality. Once he did that, selling cigarettes to women was comparatively easy.</p>

    <p class="body">This inversion approach became a staple of Bernays’s work. He used the descriptor “appeals of indirection”, and each time when “hired to sell a product or service, he instead sold whole new ways of behaving, which appeared obscure but over time reaped huge rewards for his clients and redefined the very texture of American life.”<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch7-8" href="part0055.html#ch7-link-8" class="calibre5">8</a></span></p>

    <p class="sp"><span class="akkurat_regular">W</span><span class="akkurat_regular">hat are you trying to avoid?</span> Instead of thinking through the achievement of a positive outcome, we could ask ourselves how we might achieve a terrible outcome, and let that guide our decision-making. Index funds are a great example of stock market inversion promoted and brought to bear by Vanguard’s John Bogle.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch7-9" href="part0055.html#ch7-link-9" class="calibre5">9</a></span> Instead of asking how to beat the market, as so many before him, Bogle recognized the difficulty of the task. Everyone is trying to beat the market. No one is doing it with any consistency, and in the process real people are losing actual money. So he inverted the approach. The question then became, how can we help investors minimize losses to fees and poor money manager selection? The results were one of the greatest ideas—index funds—and one of the greatest powerhouse firms in the history of finance.</p>

    <p class="body">The index fund operates on the idea that accruing wealth has a lot to do with minimizing loss. Think about your personal finances. Often we focus on positive goals, such as “I want to be rich,” and use this to guide our approach. We make investing and career choices based on our desire to accumulate wealth. We chase after magical solutions, like attempting to outsmart the stock market. These inevitably get us nowhere, and we have usually taken some terrible risks in the process which actually leave us worse off.</p>

    <p class="body">Instead, we can try inverting the goal. It becomes, not getting rich, but avoiding being poor. Instead of trying to divine the decisions that will bring wealth, we first try to eliminate those behaviors that are guaranteed to erode it. There are some pretty obvious ones. Spending more than we make, paying high interest rates on debt so that we can’t tackle paying back the principal, and not starting to save as early as we can to take advantage of the power of compounding, are all concrete financial behaviors that cost us money. We can more readily secure wealth by using inversion to make sure we are not doing the worst things that prevent the accumulation of wealth. <span class="sidebar_marker1">— Sidebar: Inversion Leads to Innovation</span></p>

    <p class="sp">One of the theoretical foundations for this type of thinking comes from psychologist Kurt Lewin.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch7-10" href="part0055.html#ch7-link-10" class="calibre5">10</a></span> In the 1930s he came up with the idea of force field analysis, which essentially recognizes that in any situation where change is desired, successful management of that change requires applied inversion. Here is a brief explanation of his process:</p>

    <ol class="calibre9">
      <li value="1" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">Identify the problem</p></li>

      <li value="2" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">Define your objective</p></li>

      <li value="3" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">Identify the forces that support change towards your objective</p></li>

      <li value="4" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">Identify the forces that impede change towards the objective</p></li>

      <li value="5" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1">Strategize a solution! This may involve both augmenting or adding to the forces in step 3, and reducing or eliminating the forces in step 4.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p class="sp">Even if we are quite logical, most of us stop after step 3. Once we figure out our objective, we focus on the things we need to put in place to make it happen, the new training or education, the messaging and marketing. But Lewin theorized that it can be just as powerful to remove obstacles to change.</p>

    <p class="body">The inversion happens between steps 3 and 4. Whatever angle you choose to approach your problem from, you need to then follow with consideration of the opposite angle. Think about not only what you could do to solve a problem, but what you could do to make it worse—and then avoid doing that, or eliminate the conditions that perpetuate it.</p>

    <p class="center_quote">«He wins his battles by making no mistakes.» <br class="calibre1"/><span class="attribution">Sun Tzu<span class="footnote_ref"><a id="ch7-11" href="part0055.html#ch7-link-11" class="calibre5">11</a></span></span></p>

    <p class="body">This inversion approach was used by Florence Nightingale to help significantly reduce the mortality rate of British soldiers in military hospitals in the late 19th century. She is often remembered as the founder of modern nursing, but she was also an excellent statistician and was the first woman elected to the Royal Statistical Society in 1858.</p>

    <p class="body">During the first winter of the Crimean War, 1854–55, the British Army endured a death rate of 23%. The next winter that rate had dropped to 2.5%.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch7-12" href="part0055.html#ch7-link-12" class="calibre5">12</a></span> The main reason for the change was a much better understanding of what was actually killing the soldiers, an understanding that rested on the detailed statistics that Florence Nightingale started to collect. She demonstrated that the leading cause of death by far was poor sanitation. In her famous polar-area chart, a completely new way of presenting data at the time, she captured a visual representation of the statistics that made them easy to understand. Improve the sanitary conditions in the hospitals, she explained, and many soldiers’ lives will be saved.</p>
