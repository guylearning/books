      <p class="calibre2"><span>M</span>aps, or models, are necessary but necessarily flawed. Lewis Carroll once jabbed at this in a story called <em class="italic">Sylvie and Bruno</em>, where one of the characters decided that his country would create a map with the scale of one mile to one mile. Obviously, such a map would not have the limitations of a map, but it wouldn’t be of much help either. You couldn’t use it to actually go anywhere. It wouldn’t fit in your pocket or your car. We need maps to condense the territory we are trying to navigate.</p>
