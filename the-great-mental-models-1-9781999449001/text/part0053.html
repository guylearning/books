    <p class="calibre2">I’m forever indebted to Charlie Munger, Peter Kaufman, Warren Buffett, and Peter Bevelin, who, to varying degrees, started me down the path of multidisciplinary thinking. I owe them a huge debt of gratitude. While I’ve sought wisdom from the world, it’s a journey that one starts and never completes.</p>

    <p class="body">When I first started learning about multidisciplinary thinking there was no source of collected wisdom—no place where I could find the big ideas from multiple disciplines in one place. This book, and indeed, this series, is meant to bring some of the big invariant ideas into the world to help us better understand the world we live in and how it interconnects. These pages are filled with ideas from many great minds. It’s only fair to point out that any idea you found in this book comes from someone else.</p>

    <p class="body">This book would not be here without the work and talents of Rhiannon Beaubien, Morgwn Rimel, Marcia Mihotich, and Garvin Hirt.</p>

    <p class="body">I have many friends to thank for reading the manuscript and offering thoughtful and critical feedback for which I’m grateful. Thank you Zachary Smith, Devon Anderson, Jeff Annello, Simon Hørup Eskildsen, Laurence Endersen, and Paul Ciampa.</p>

    <p class="body">I want to thank Néna Rawdah for helping edit this from a manuscript into a book.</p>

    <p class="body">I also want to thank my kids, William and Mackenzie, who, without knowing it, have provided me with a renewed sense of curiosity and understanding. This book is for you.</p>

    <p class="body">I hope you pull this book off your shelf whenever you’re stuck or need inspiration in understanding our world. It’s designed to be a reference book of big ideas but also a book that pulls you in aesthetically through the intersection of design and content.</p>
