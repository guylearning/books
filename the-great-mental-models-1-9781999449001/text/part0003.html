    <h1 class="headings" id="calibre_pb_0">The quality of your thinking depends on the models that are in your head.</h1>

    <p class="calibre2">This is a statement we strongly believe in at Farnam Street. This conviction drives much of what we do.</p>

    <p class="body">When you learn to see the world as it is, and not as you want it to be, everything changes. The solution to any problem becomes more apparent when you can view it through more than one lens. You’ll be able to spot opportunities you couldn’t see before, avoid costly mistakes that may be holding you back, and begin to make meaningful progress in your life.</p>

    <p class="body">That’s the power of mental models. And that’s why we created the Great Mental Models project.</p>

    <p class="body">The Great Mental Models Project is a labor of love to help equalize opportunity in the world by making a high-quality, multidisciplinary, interconnected education free and available to everyone. That’s a big ambition. To get there, we’re starting with five reference books that cover core mental models from major disciplines: Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Systems and more. We have gathered these timeless individual ideas into a coherent whole.</p>

    <p class="body">Along with the books, we’re developing additional tools and resources to help readers more readily connect the models in their heads, so their use becomes second nature. By purchasing this book, you make it possible for us to continue our efforts and see this initiative through to completion. We’re grateful for your support.
