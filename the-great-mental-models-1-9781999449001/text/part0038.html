    <p class="tpwaitc_bios">Bayes, Thomas.<br class="calibre1"/>1702-1761 - English statistician and minister. The theorem which bears his name is a critical part of probability mathematics. He never published it himself, and so we have to thank his friend Richard Price for not losing this work to history.</p>

    <p class="tpwaitc_bios">Atkins, Vera.<br class="calibre1"/>1908-2000 - Romanian-British intelligence officer. She received high honors from both the British and French governments for her work for the allies during World War II.</p>
