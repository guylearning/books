      <p class="calibre2"><span>R</span>obert Heinlein’s character Doc Graves describes the Devil Fallacy in the 1941 sci-fi story “Logic of Empire”, as he explains the theory to another character:</p>

      <p class="archer">“I would say you’ve fallen into the commonest fallacy of all in dealing with social and economic subjects—the ‘devil’ theory. You have attributed conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity…. You think bankers are scoundrels. They are not. Nor are company officials, nor patrons, nor the governing classes back on earth. Men are constrained by necessity and build up rationalizations to account for their acts.”</p>

      <p class="archer">Hanlon’s Razor is a great tool for overcoming this fallacy, one we all fall into at one time or another.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="body">As useful as it can be, it is, however, important not to overthink this model. Hanlon’s Razor is meant to help us perceive stupidity or error, and their inadvertent consequences. It says that of all possible motives behind an action, the ones that require the least amount of energy to execute (such as ignorance or laziness) are more likely to occur than one that requires active malice.</p>

    <p class="akkurat_regular1">Conclusion</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Ultimately, Hanlon’s Razor demonstrates that there are fewer true villains than you might suppose—what people are is human, and like you, all humans make mistakes and fall into traps of laziness, bad thinking, and bad incentives. Our lives are easier, better, and more effective when we recognize this truth and act accordingly. <span class="sidebar_marker1">— Sidebar: The Devil Fallacy</span></p>
