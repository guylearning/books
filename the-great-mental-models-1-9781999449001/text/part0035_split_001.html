      <p class="calibre2"><span>W</span>arren Buffett used a very apt metaphor once to describe how the second-order problem is best described by a crowd at a parade: Once a few people decide to stand on their tip-toes, everyone has to stand on their tip-toes. No one can see any better, but they’re all worse off.</p>

    <p class="sp">Let’s look at two areas where second-order thinking can be used to great benefit:</p>

    <ol class="akkurat_regular3">
      <li value="1" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular"> Prioritizing long-term interests over immediate gains</span></p></li>

      <li value="2" class="calibre8"><p class="archer1"><span class="akkurat_regular"> Constructing effective arguments</span></p></li>
    </ol>

    <p class="sp"><span class="akkurat_regular">Second-order thinking and realizing long-term interests: </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2">This is a useful model for seeing past immediate gains to identify long-term effects we want. This is often a conflict for us, as when we choose to forgo the immediate pleasure of candy to improve our long-term health. The first-order effect is this amazing feeling triggered by pure sugar. But what are the second-order effects of regular candy consumption? Is this what I want my body or life to look like in ten years? Second-order thinking involves asking ourselves if what we are doing now is going to get us the results we want.</p>

    <p class="body">Finding historical examples of second-order thinking can be tricky because we don’t want to evaluate based solely on the outcome: “It all turned out well, so he must have thought through the consequences of his actions.” Even if you can glimpse the long-term gain from your short-term pain, there is no guarantee you are going to get there.</p>

    <p class="body">In 48 BC, Cleopatra of Egypt was in a terrible position.<span class="footnote_ref2"><a id="ch5-5" href="part0055.html#ch5-link-5" class="calibre5">5</a></span> Technically co-regent with her brother, in a family famous for murdering siblings, she was encamped in a swampy desert, ousted from the palace, stuck with no solid plan for how to get back. She was Queen, but had made a series of unpopular decisions which left her with little support, and which gave her brother ample justification for trying to have her assassinated. What to do?</p>

    <p class="body">At the same time the great Roman general Caesar arrived in Egypt, chasing down his enemy Pompey and making sure the Egyptians knew who really was in charge on the Mediterranean. Egypt was an incredibly fertile, wealthy country, and as such was of great importance to the Romans. The way they inserted themselves in Egypt, however, made them extremely unpopular there.</p>

      <p class="captions"><span>_</span><br class="calibre1"/>In order to meet Caesar and develop an alliance, yet barred from the palace, Cleopatra organized an elaborate plot to smuggle herself in wrapped in a cloth and stuffed in a basket.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="body">In order to survive, Cleopatra had to make some decisions. Should she try to work things out with her brother? Should she try to marshal some support from another country? Or should she try to align herself with Caesar?</p>

    <p class="body">In <em class="italic">Cleopatra: A Life</em>, Stacy Schiff explains that even in 48 BC at the age of 21, Cleopatra would have had a superb political education, based on both historical knowledge and firsthand exposure to the tumultuous events of life on the Mediterranean. She would have observed actions taken by her father, Auletes, as well as various family members, that resulted in exile, bribery, and murder from either the family, the Romans, or the populace. She would have known that there were no easy answers. As Schiff explains, “What Auletes passed down to his daughter was a precarious balancing act. To please one constituency was to displease another. Failure to comply with Rome would lead to intervention. Failure to stand up to Rome would lead to riots.”</p>

    <p class="body">In this situation it was thus imperative that Cleopatra consider the second-order effects of her actions. Short-term gain might easily lead to execution (as indeed it already had for many of her relatives). If she wanted to be around for a while, she needed to balance her immediate goals of survival and the throne, with the future need for support to stay on it.</p>

    <p class="body">In 48 BC Cleopatra chose to align herself with Caesar. It seems likely she would have known the first-order effects of this decision: Namely that it would anger her brother, who would increase his plotting to have her killed, and that it would anger the Egyptian people, who didn’t want a Roman involved in their affairs. She probably anticipated that there would be short-term pain, and there was. Cleopatra effectively started a civil war, with a siege on the palace that left her and Caesar trapped there for months. In addition, she had to be constantly vigilant against the assassination schemes of her brother. So why did she do it?</p>
